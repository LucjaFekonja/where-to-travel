Mosque of the Sacred Cloak,"The revered home of the Mosque of the Sacred Cloak and a city steeped in history, Kandahar sits at the crossroads where southern Afghanistan meets the mountains of the country&#8217;s heartland. The traditional seat of Pashtun power, it was the capital of the last Afghan empire during the years of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Today, the place is filled with mosques, shrines, and mausoleums to luminaries from the national past, and folk come to see the curious inscriptions of the great Mughal invader Babur on the Chilzina View, located just on the edges of the city. "
Blue Mosque,"The cobalt domes of the great Blue Mosque shoulder their way above the skyline of Mazar-e Sharif, glowing white-hot under the scorching Balkh sun. Famed as the burial site of Ali bin Talib, the cousin of the Prophet Mohammad himself, it&#8217;s a gorgeous array of arabesque and south Asian architecture, complete with turquoise-blue domes and gold-peppered minarets. However, the Muslim history is just one aspect of Mazar-e Sharif, because this city is also home to countless Greek relics; ones that found their way here with the coming of Alexander&#8217;s armies in the 3rd century BC! "
mausoleum of King Amanullah Khan,"Founded – like so many other cities in these parts – by the emperor Akbar, Jalalabad is a place where the passage of ancient time is virtually palpable. You can often just about make out the snowy peaks of the Safid Mountain Range on the horizon, and imagine how the Mughal armies would have felt as they contemplated them way back in the 1500s. Closer to the city and the climate allows for citrus orchards and green parks – something Jalalabad is known for. You can also see the mausoleum of King Amanullah Khan, join the locals for hotly-contested cricket game, or just enjoy the manicured parks and gardens. "
Green Mosque,"Hailed as the epicenter of the Bactrian Empire of old, the aged town of Balkh has a history going back almost 4,000 years! In fact, it was here, high up in the gaps of the northern ridges of the Hindu Kush, that Zoroastrianism and Buddhism first flourished in these reaches. By the time the Venetian adventurer Marco Polo arrived in the 1300s, the town would have been razed (even by Genghis Khan himself) and rebuilt many times, but memories of its great fortification walls and learning institutions would still have been ripe. Today, the town is hardly the noble capital it once was, but there is a certain palpable history to be found amidst the buzzing bazaars and emerald-hued Green Mosque. "
The Friday Mosque,"It&#8217;s easy to see why Herat – the third-largest city in Afghanistan – has such a Persian flavor to it: the town sits just a stone&#8217;s throw from the Iranian border, and it was once the home of the Timurid dynasty (a lineage that fused elements of Turkic, Persian and Mongol culture in their time). The great piece de resistance of the city is The Friday Mosque. This elegant structure of turquoise-tipped minarets and shimmering tiles is sure to wow the senses – it&#8217;s thought to be more than eight centuries old! There&#8217;s also the Herat Citadel to see, and the tombs of revered Sufi poets. "
Takht i Rostam,"While the town of Samangan is an ancient caravan stop on the periphery routes of the old Silk Road, that claim to fame isn&#8217;t actually it&#8217;s major draw. That honor goes to the mysterious cave complexes of Takht i Rostam that carve their way through the dusty ridges of the mountains nearby. These are thought to have been built in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, and are adorned with gorgeous Buddhist inlays of lotus leaves, all focusing on an inner mud-brick stupa. They offer an immersive glimpse into an almost-forgotten, pre-Muslim past. "
Bamiyan,"For lovers of culture and religious history, the Bamiyan story is a very sad one. In ancient times, the place was known as a hub for Hindu–Buddhist worship, and it thrived with artisans, monasteries and – especially – sculptors in the ages before the Muslim invasion. In fact, the two giant statues of the Buddha that stood here were considered some of the most elegant 4th and 5th century carvings in all of Asia. In March 2001, however, these great effigies were destroyed by the Taliban, causing international outrage, and even prompting UNESCO to tag their remains to prevent further destruction. "
Wakhan Corridor,"Backed by the cracked and chiseled passes of the mighty Hindu Kush, Faizabad sits hidden its very own remote enclave of the northern Afghan mountains. The location is what defines the town: giving it that rustic, backwater feel. You&#8217;ll see galumphing donkeys strutting the streets and beady-eyed, bearded sheep farmers wandering the bazaars. You&#8217;ll meet local highlanders with feet worn by the trails of the great Wakhan Corridor. You&#8217;ll find spice-scented stew houses and be able to explore the gorgeous alpine valleys of the Kokcha River. "
Band-e Amir National Park,"The breathtaking reaches of the Band-e Amir became home to the first ever national park in Afghanistan back in 2009. It’s easy to see why too! Peppered by no fewer than six individual mountain lakes, perched more than 3,000 meters up in the rugged peaks of the Hindu Kush, and forged by millennia of fascinating geological movements, the whole area is a wondrous place to behold. Hikers come in the spring and summer (when the temperatures are not an unbearable 20 Celsius below!), to wonder at the cobalt-blue waters of Band-e Panir and the Band-e Gholaman. "
Kabul,"Kabul has been plunged in chaos since the takeover of the Mujahedeen and al-Qaeda, the Taliban insurgents and other factions after the start of the country&#8217;s modern wars. Despite the presence of peacekeeping forces, insurgents lurk in the shadows of the city, striking with bombs and attacks every now and then. It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs for a capital with so much to offer. Kabul was once a cultural hotpot of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. Later there were Hindus here and even Alexander the Great. Today, this rich past can be explored at the Kabul Museum – that is, if you deem it safe to enter. "
Kunduz,"Kunduz is actually little more than a transportation hub for travelers eager to cross the tristate border in the north, where Tajikistan meets Uzbekistan meets Afghanistan. However, it does come enfolded in great swathes of verdant farmlands, and has a down-to-earth, rustic ambience that&#8217;s lost on the larger cities on this list. Unfortunately, more recent times have seen the tumult of the Afghan wars flair up again near Kunduz, and there have been pitched battles between the Taliban, the army, and various insurgent groups. In other words, come here expecting to enter a war zone. "
Khyber Pass,"The Khyber Pass certainly falls into that wide category of places not currently on the menu for the traveler in Afghanistan – since at least 2007, the whole region here has been dominated by Taliban guerrillas, with western aid and military convoys targeted specifically. However, once the tensions lift and the war subsides, this high-perched stretch of land in the heights of the Spin Ghar will certainly be worth the visit. Why? Well, because for centuries it&#8217;s hosted armies and traders. They came on the Silk Road from China and the east, or they came in the form of awesome military leaders like Alexander the Great and Genghis Kahn. "
Panjshir Valley,"Carving its way into the foothills of the Hindu Kush from the eastern provinces of Afghanistan, the Panjshir Valley is tipped to become one of the newfound industrial powerhouses of the nation. With American investment taking the lead, talk of everything from emerald mining to hydroelectric generation is being floated for these parts. However, for the time being, Panjshir remains the glorious medley of snow-topped mountains and winding rivers, verdant fields and rustic hamlets its always been – except, that is, when the Soviets rolled this way during their invasion in the 1980s. "
Bagram Valley,"Although the small eastern city of Bagram, located just a stone&#8217;s throw from both Kabul – the capital – and the rises of the Hindu Kush, is perhaps best known to modern onlookers as the sight of the largest allied military base in the country, this one&#8217;s story actually goes a lot deeper than that. For starters, the town was conquered in the 300s BC by none other than Alexander the Great, who subsequently made changes to its layout in the Grecian manner. And later, the place passed to the Mauryan Empire, who brought their Indian artistic traditions to bear on the region. "
Taloqan,"Taloqan sits in the shadow of the colossal Hindu Kush, just over the mountains from the Pashtun regions of southern Afghanistan. It&#8217;s thought that the surrounding valleys have been occupied for more than a millennium; a fact revealed by the narrations of one Marco Polo, who passed this way in 1275. However, the Taloqan of today is a more modern place, with markets bustling with shoppers and mules meeting purring tuk-tuks in the streets. The memory and brutal reality of the 2001 war remains raw here, so it&#8217;s a subject certainly best avoided. "

In 1989 the bridge was changed to support just one line of traffic and then in 1991 the bridge was closed to traffic and a new one build alongside this one. "
"Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama","Samford Hall has its home on the campus of Auburn University. It is named after William Samford who was the governor of Alabama between 1900 and 1901. The clock tower is the most famous part of the building and each day just after noon it plays the University fight song, War Eagle. "
Cordova,"Because the state is not part of the continental US, there are plenty of areas that you could call the states hidden gems. And the top of that list is Cordova. Forming the head of Orca Inlet in Prince William Sound, the town is surrounded by mountains carved from glaciers, dense green forest, wetlands filled with wildlife, and tons of water. Which means that hiking, skiing, photography, birding, fishing, and flight seeing are all on the menu. Nearby is Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, the largest national park in the US. With over 13 million acres that have been formed by plate tectonics, many of the peaks here rival the elevation of the Himalayas. Be sure to trek down Copper River Highway to see the Child Glacier and the Million Dollar Bridge (built in 1910). "
Talkeetna,"With 1000 residents, Talkeenta is tucked away in the shadow of the country’s tallest peak, Mt. McKinley. Established as a gold rush town when the Alaska Railroad was growing, the town now receives winter and summer visitors. In the summer there’s fishing thanks to three rivers that all converge in town as well as kayaking, river boating, zip-lining, and a truly American sport: ATV-ing.

The panoramic view of the Alaskan Range is a photographers dream come true. Be sure to check out some of the many locally brewed beers that Talkeetna is famous for. "
"Eagle, Alaska","After the gold rush ended, the town of Eagle dropped to a population of nine (seven of which were city council members!). Located on the bank of the Yukon River, Eagle is now a living museum to a by-gone era. The locals are proud to say that they’ve never invested in restoration because the town has never changed. In fact, when the town shifted to tourism in the 1950’s, papers were found in the judge’s desk at the courthouse that dated back to the 1900’s. Today, you can see plenty of originals like the customs house, the army fort, original furnishing in public buildings, and more. There are five museums in town and the clerk of courts maintains a list of everyone who has ever lived in Eagle. "
Skagway,"The gateway to the Klondike Gold Rush was Skagway. There was so much excitement in the air as everyone was hopeful of soon being rich beyond belief. This old frontier town is still as rugged and beautiful as it ever was. It’s a popular stop for cruise ships thanks to its location at the northern tip of the Inside Passage. One of the most popular attractions is a ride on the White Pass and Yukon Route rail. It’s a feat of engineering genius as the line ascends more than 3000 feet through spectacular and pristine wilderness. You’ll find great restaurants, museums, and a pretty respectable night life for a town of only 1000. "
"Ester, Alaska","It’s the character of the locals that bring visitors to Ester. They’re known to be quirky and captivating folks who do things their own unique way.

Thanks to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, Sitka is great for whale-watching, kayaking, fishing, and more.

"
"Gustavus, Alaska","This is where you go for quiet and comfort. With a population of 400, Gustavus has a few paved roads and several cosy B&amp;B’s. Unwind with family style meals and an evening by the fire.

"Girdwood, Alaska","Near to Anchorage, Girdwood is located on the Turnagain Arm. It’s known for the rare bore tide that comes into the inlet every day.

Himara beach,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-things-albanian-riviera/"">The Albanian Riviera</a> is perhaps the most popular place in the country for tourists to visit.

"
Main Square of Tirana,"The capital city of Albania, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-tirana-albania/"">Tirana</a> will be the starting point for many people exploring the best places in Albania. The city is home to few must-see tourist locations, but the 18th-century Et&#8217;hem Bey mosque is well worth a visit. Tirana&#8217;s people, like the vast majority of Albanian locals, are exceptionally friendly and the city is supremely affordable, with surprisingly <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/traditional-food-albania/"">excellent food and drinks</a> both very cheap. Skanderbeg Square is one of Tirana&#8217;s most important places and this is where the National Historical Museum can be found too. At the heart of Skanderbeg Square &#8211; and therefore the heart of Tirana &#8211; is a statue of the historic Albanian national hero Skanderbeg. "
Llogara Pass,"The Llogara Pass is one of Albania&#8217;s most famous places, with the road providing one of the most spectacular drives in the whole world.

"
Berat,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-berat-albania/"">Berat</a> is in the middle of Albania and it is believed to be one of the country&#8217;s oldest towns. Berat is often known by its nickname &#8211; the City of a Thousand Windows &#8211; due to its mix of Ottoman and Albanian architecture. Berat&#8217;s main tourist site is the 140th century castle, Kalaja, which is still home to hundreds of people. Formerly among the most important Albanian cities of the Ottoman Empire, Berat was added to the list of Unesco World Heritage sites in 2008. The Church of St. Mary of Blachernae is a must-see sight for anyone visiting Berat, as is the Mangalem Quarter. "
Saranda,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/10-best-things-saranda-albania/"">Saranda</a> is one of the hottest tourism locations in Albania, with the town having undergone a huge amount of development in the last 20 years or so.

Saranda is located a short trip across the Ionian Sea from the popular Greek island of Corfu. "
Gjirokastra,"A Unesco city, Gjirokastra is without a doubt one of the best places to visit in Albania. Unique Ottoman period architecture &#8211; with houses designed like small castles &#8211; can be found all over Gjirokastra, which has a military museum and art gallery in its amazing castle that dominates the skyline. A folklore festival also takes place in Gjirokastra&#8217;s castle every five years &#8211; the last one was in 2015. Visiting the old Ottoman bazaar in Gjirokastra should be on the agenda for anyone visiting this part of the country. Gjirokastra is famous as the birthplace of world-renowned author Ismail Kadare and Albania&#8217;s former dictator Enver Hoxha &#8211; today their old homes are museums. "
Kruja,"Located a short trip away from the capital Tirana, Kruja is a must-visit spot for anyone heading to Albania for the first time. Kruja is home to the national ethnographic museum, but it is best known for being where the Skanderbeg museum can be found.

The castle also offers staggering views of the Adriatic Sea. The national park Qafe Shtama and the tomb of Sari Saltik are also located close to Kruja. "
Theth National Park,"Away from Albania&#8217;s biggest cities, in the north of the country, is Theth. Located high in the Albanian Alps, Theth is a designated area of outstanding natural beauty and it is easy to see why. Theth National Park is perhaps the most beautiful place in all of Albania, with its Grunas Waterfall and the Lock-in Tower both extremely popular with visitors. The mountain peaks of Thethi, Boga, Razma and Vermoshi provide an unforgettable experience of Albania in its most natural state. Hikers and nature lovers will find Theth to be one of the best places to visit during a trip to Albania. "
Ksamil Islands,"The highlight of the Albanian Riviera is perhaps the Ksamil Islands, a remote group of three small islands located just off the coast, accessible only by boat from the small town of Ksamil. Part of the larger Butrint National Park, the Ksamil Islands are a fantastic example of Albania at its most untouched and unspoiled. Visiting the Blue Eye Spring is also a must for anyone who wants to experience what Ksamil has to offer during their magical Albanian break. July and August are the busiest time of year for the Ksamil Islands, but even then there are few tourists around here. "
Shkodra,"The largest town in the north of Albania, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-shkodra-albania/"">Shkodra</a> is often considered the cultural capital of the country. This is because it hosts events such as Carnival, Lake Day, the Children&#8217;s Festival and Shkodra Jazz Fest, while it is also home to a famous historic castle notable for its important role during the First Balkan War. Shkodra has a simply gorgeous lake, while the medieval citadel of Drisht is only a few miles away. The famous Migjeni theatre is in Shkodra as well, along with an ace market that is well worth visiting. Shkodra&#8217;s Malazeze cuisine is perhaps Albania&#8217;s best too. "
Vlore,"In the south-west of Albania is the popular coastal resort of <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-vlore-albania/"">Vlore</a>, which has long been best known for its olive production &#8211; it is believed to house some 280,000 olive trees. Vlore has many important historic sights, but perhaps the most famous of them is the Albanian Independence Proclamation Building, which is where Albania declared independence a little over 100 years ago. Today, there is a monument dedicated to this defining moment in Albania&#8217;s history. The area of Cold Water in Vlore is popular with younger tourists due to its choice of hip bars and restaurants. "
Byzantine Church in Apollonia,"Apollonia was once one of the most important cities in the world, and as such it is a must for anyone visiting Albania for the first time. Found in the heart of Albania, within easy reach from the city of Fier, Apollonia&#8217;s ruins are breathtaking and the views from this part of the country are superb too. Once upon a time, Apollonia was listed among the dominions of Pyrrhus of Epirus. Those days are long gone, but Apollonia should still be on the itinerary for anyone who wants to learn more about Albania&#8217;s rich history up close. "
Durres,"Albania&#8217;s main port, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-durres-albania/"">Durres</a> is also one of the nation&#8217;s oldest cities. Durres is most famous for being home to the biggest amphitheater in the Balkans, while the unspoiled northern coastal stretch of Lalzit Bay is one of Albania&#8217;s most beautiful places to visit. Tourists should consider taking time out of their schedules to visit the Durres Archaeological Museum, the Aleksander Moisiu Theatre and the Royal Villa of Durres during their time in the second largest city in Albania. Many cultural events and feastings are held in Durres throughout the year, while the city is also the birthplace of Bujar Nishani, the current President of Albania. "
Koman Lake,"For the most breathtaking scenery in the entire Balkans, visiting Lake Koman in Albania should be on anyone&#8217;s bucket list. Often described as one of the world&#8217;s great boat trips, the journey takes visitors from the hydro-electric dam at Koman to the port of Fierza. While the locals that use the boat regularly may now take the rugged beauty of the Albanian mountains for granted, any first-time visitor will find the sights from the Lake Koman Ferry to be truly jaw-dropping. The trip on the ferry is also a great opportunity to see what life is like for many Albanians in remote areas. "
Pogradec,"One of the most up-and-coming places to visit in Albania is Pogradec, which can be found on the shores of Lake Ohrid in the east of the nation. Lake Ohrid is the deepest lake in the Balkan region and while the Macedonian side of the lake is more popular, Albania&#8217;s shore is definitely on the up. Pogradec is famous for its rich folklore, while its Puppet Theater Festival is one of the most interesting events on Albania&#8217;s tourism calendar. The stunning Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park is around 30-45 minutes away from Pogradec as well, while the springs of Drilon are also close. "
"Algiers, Algeria","Algiers is the capital city in Algeria and has an estimated population of around 3,500,000. The city was founded by the Ottomans and is rife with history and beautiful architecture. The ancient Casbah is a winding urban maze, with streets flowing through the old town like streams. Also worth exploring is the Dar Hassan Pacha, which was once the city&#8217;s most decedent mansion. The interior of the house has been under renovation since 2005 and is unfortunately closed to the public. The city of Algiers offers visitors from the west a stark and beautiful contrast and an intriguing glimpse into the past, present and future of Algeria. "
Ahaggar National Park,"Although difficult to reach without your own transport, the Atakor Plateau, situated in the Ahaggar National Park, is worth any of the effort or inconvenience. The landscape is a red-brown dry landscaped dotted with harsh sheer peaks. The terrain is like something straight out of a sci-fi flick and is a sight that will stick with you for a long time. The highlight of the plateau is the Assekrem Peak. Assekrem in the Tuareg language means &#8220;the end of the world&#8221; which is a fitting way to describe the view from the peak and the rugged harshness of the landscape. "
Tamanrasset,"Tamanrasset, sometimes referred to as &#8216;Tam&#8217; is a modern and lively town that you will find if you travel south through Algeria towards Niger. Tam has everything you might expect from a modern town including a number of shops, restaurants, banks and travel amenities. The town is a great base for exploring the Ahaggar National Park whilst retaining comforts of a well equipped town. For various reasons, the town is considered unsafe to visit at present and it is only possible to visit as part of a fully guided tour. Proof of a guided tour must be provided upon arrival in the town. Although this is currently a requirement it is not necessarily a bad things as it improves the safety of visitors and several fun excursions such a 4&#215;4 tours are often included. "
Oran,"Oran is the second city of Algeria, it is a lively port city with heaps of character and beauty. Oran is an attraction in its own right and has historical buildings a plenty to explore including beautiful mosques, the Casbah and Le Theatre. The range of beautiful architecture is possibly the best of any city in Algeria. Oran is also a great place for scuba diving, sampling Algerian cuisine and listening to lively Rai music which has its origins in the city. Despite many positive reasons to visit the city there are also many signs of the country&#8217;s political troubles in the 90s are visible in Oran. The city filled novelist Albert Camus with so much dread that he based his novel &#8216;The Plague&#8217; here. "
Annaba,"There were many geographical reasons for the Phoenicians to found Annaba that are still apparent today and are the reason for the cities relative prosperity. The city has a natural port which handles many of the country&#8217;s exports but for travellers, the city&#8217;s history and culture, especially Hippo Regius, is the main attraction. The ruins of Hippo Regius are surrounded by olive trees on one side and the sea on the other. The ruins include mosaics, bronze trophies and ruins of villas and temples. "
Constantine,"Constantine is a natural marvel that has transformed over the years into a stunning spot for tourists. The city was the Capital of Numidia and after that Roman Numidia and it goes without saying that politics and power have always played a part here. The majority of buildings in the city can only be reached by crossing the bridge across a large canyon. This gives the city a feeling of fantasy that has been retained since the time of the Romans. Despite the unique way the city looks, and its astonishing history, there is not much to see here in terms of attraction and tourists may find that a couple of days here is enough. "
Ghardaia,"Ghardaia is part of a five town cluster right on the edge of the Sahara Desert but is also the name often used to refer to the entire cluster. Ghardaia is almost a country in its own right with its own dress, religion and social traditions. Guides are required in order to access the beautiful old town or the Sidi Brahim mosque. Food and accommodation here, as in most Algerian cities, varies immensely in price and quality. If you choose to visit Ghardaia whilst in Algeria you may leave feeling like you have visited more than one country. "
Tlemcen Old Town,"For stunning Moorish buildings in Algeria there is only one option: Tlemcen. The buildings here can compete in beauty with those in Southern Spain or Morocco. The town was important for the Romans but sadly not much evidence has survived from those times. Sights include the Great Mosque, the Eiffel Bridge and waterfalls in the nearby National Park of Tlemcen. Tlemcen has its sights firmly set on the future and is currently in the process of building what will be the largest university campus in the country. "
Setif,"Another of Algeria&#8217;s cities which was founded by the Romans, Setif is situated in the Little Kabylie region of Algeria and is over 1,100 meters above sea level. The roman ruins here are well worth taking time to study. In addition to the Romans, the French have also left their mark on the city. Sights in the city include the main square with its Roman sculptures. Tourists are a fairly rare sight in this city which for some may be a reason to visit and see the &#8216;real Algeria&#8217; far from the beaten track but it does have its disadvantages and western tourists should exercise caution. "
El Oued,"Intriguingly nicknamed &#8216;the city of a thousand domes&#8217;, El Oued is an oasis of a city in what seems to be an endless sea of sand. The reason for the nickname comes from the many domed roofs on buildings in the city. The reason for the domes is protection from the intense heat from the sun in summer. One of the main reasons tourists visit El Oued is to shop, the city is arguably the best place for shoppers in the country. Popular items include carpets and affanes (traditional Algerian slippers). Do not even think about entering the market unless you intend to barter like a local to get the best bargain. The souqs can get busy especially on a Friday. "
Djanet,"Djanet almost looks like a Mediterranean town with its white buildings and blue roofs but it is in fact the the main town in the Tassili region of Algeria. Set in a palm tree oasis, the town feels almost tropical. The town is picturesque but has a very small centre with only a post office, bank and a handful of restaurants and shops. The town bursts into life at the weekend as French tourists arrive to experience the peacefulness and exotic surroundings on offer in Djanet. "
"The Municipal People&#8217;s Assembly, Batna","Batna is not far from Constantine but it feels entirely different. Separated from Constantine by harsh salt flats, Batna is the capital of the Aurus Massif, a region of Algeria made up from a continuation of the Atlas Mountains. Batna&#8217;s history is nowhere near as extensive as some of the cities in Algeria and has only existed since a decree in 1848 signed by Napoleon III. Due to its location in a valley, the summers are very hot and the winters very cold. There is a lively student scene here due to the city&#8217;s population of over 30,000 students. "
Timgad,"Only 40km away from Batna but a different attraction entirely, Timgad is the expensive ruins of an entire Roman town. The ruins are a little overwhelming at first but reward those that take the time to explore every row and road. There is an entrance fee but it is well worth it for what is arguably one of the most stunning Roman ruin sites in the world. Nothing else in Algeria will prepare you for the vastness of the Roman ruins in Timgad. "
"City Gate, In Salah",In Salah owes its name to its famous (or perhaps infamous) salty water. The water is an acquired taste and is often the only type of drinking water available so come prepared with your own stash if you prefer the none salty variety. The buildings are Sudanese in style and the mosque with In Salah is slowly being encroached by a moving sand dune. The dune moves at a rate of 1m every five years and as it devours one building it often reveals another that has been under the sand for some time. 
Bejaia,"Bejaia is situated on Algeria&#8217;s Mediterranean coastline and this is the city&#8217;s primary attraction for tourists. The history of the city is expansive and has been settled by the Vandals, Byzantines and Ottoman Turks. The museum in the city has various artifacts to prove this turbulent history. In addition to the museum there is also an impressive Spanish fortress and the so called &#8216;Monkey Peak&#8217; which is home to the endangered Barbary Macaque monkey. "
Andorra la Vella,"The capital of Andorra, Andorra la Vella sits in the Pyrenees. The city has a population of just over 20,000 people meaning that it is small and compact and yet there is much to see here for discerning tourists. With a lively bar and cafe culture, Andorra la Vella has a vibrant main artery in the form of the main street that has galleries showcasing local art, handicraft shops, and restaurants. For those looking to get a glimpse of the history of Andorra, there are guided tours of Casa de la Vell, a historic building dating from the 16th century famed for its period artwork and historically significant documents. Also of note in Andorra la Vella is the Sant Esteve Church, built in the 12th century that features ornate wooden decorations. To enjoy all that Andorra la Vella has to offer, head over to Plaça del Poble, the main square of the city that sits atop the roof of an administrative complex, and visitors can ascend to the square and take in the unspoilt views over the city and beyond. "
Encamp,"Head over to the town of Encamp to enjoy this picturesque spot that is bisected by the Valira d’Orient River. The town has a wealth of pretty historical buildings for visitor to explore, as well as quaint cafes, restaurants serving local fare, and boutiques selling art and crafts. One of the big draws in Encamp is its National Automobile Museum that has a vast collection of vintage automobiles including steam powered cars and motorcycles. The town is also the starting point for several key locations in Andorra, such as the Pic dels Pessons Mountain, and those who enjoy hiking and rambling can explore the area easily in a day from Encamp. Come ski season, there is a ski lift that takes visitors to Grau Roig or Pas de la Casa in order to hit the slopes in style. "
Pas de la Casa,"Nestled on the border with <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-places-visit-france/"">France</a>, Pas de la Casa is one of Andorra’s top ski resorts, and now features 31 ski lifts to allow visitors access to all areas below the Pic d’Envalira. Unlike some of the other ski resorts in Andorra, Pas de la Casa better serves intermediate or advanced skiers as there are a number of red pistes that span the surrounding terrain. There is also a focus on nightlife and après-ski here, making Pas de la Casa popular with younger travellers looking for some lively venues to relax in after a long day of skiing. If you want to do some shopping then there are a number of warehouses along the pass between France and Andorra that sell duty free products. "
Basilica Sanctuary of Meritxell,"Come to the town of Meritxell for the stunning Basilica Sanctuary of Nostra Senyora de Meritxell. The sanctuary is Romanesque in style and originally dates from the 17th century, and has been lovingly preserved and restored after a fire in the 1970s. The basilica is known for its ornate statues of patron saints (one for each parish in Andorra) as well as its cloisters and a spectacular mirror room. Part of the ancient chapel now houses a museum that features historic objects and artwork that celebrates the basilica and the Virgin of Meritxell. "
Anyós &#8211; Church of Saint Christopher,"The dinky village of Anyós sits in the La Massana parish and provides an enjoyable afternoon of sightseeing about one kilometre outside of La Massana proper. If you happen to visit Anyós in July you may witness the village’s annual carnival which features the blessing of a carriage in the village square. Also worth a visit is the Church of Saint Christopher that dates from medieval times in homage to the patron saint of the village. Popular pastimes in the surrounding areas of Anyós include bird watching and fishing, and this is the perfect place to go for a stroll and take in the local Alpine flora and fauna. "
El Serrat,"If you want to get out of the city of Andorra la Vella and really want to get away from it all then look no further that El Serrat, a tiny little village in a quiet corner of the Valira del Nord Valley. The village is located up in the mountains which means that whatever direction you look in you will find stunning views of the surrounding countryside, and nature lovers should definitely not miss the opportunity to ramble in the region, particularly for those who love Alpine scenery. Popular activities in and around El Serrat include bird watching, hiking, and in the winter months the area is blanketed in snow and you can indulge in cross country skiing or snowboarding in the downhill areas. "
Sant Martí de la Cortinada church,"Famed for being a place of almost unparallel natural beauty in Andorra, the delightful village of La Cortinada sits amongst flower meadows, fields, and imposing mountains, and is known for its ornate historical buildings. For an example of Romanesque architecture in La Cortinada, walk over to the Sant Martí de la Cortinada church and enjoy the vibrant frescoes and a dovecot. There is also a carved wooden alter that dates from the 18th century as well as a sculpted confessional and elaborate carved wooden decorations throughout. After visiting the town proper, there are a number of walking trails that encircle the village if you want to check out the views and the local plant and wildlife. "
Vallnord,"Andorra is well known as a prime skiing location, and no more so than at Vallnord, and visitors from all over Europe flock here for the crisp snow and pristine skiing conditions. Vallnord, part of the Pyrenees, caters for skiers of all levels of ability, so whether you just want to try one of the beginner trails or take to the professional slopes, there is something for everyone to enjoy here. Families also head to Vallnord to take advantage of the ski schools and family activities such as tobogganing and snowshoeing, or you can even whizz around the area on a snowmobile if you are so inclined. "
Les Escaldes,"Located just outside of the city of Andorra la Vella, Les Escaldes is the place to come if you enjoy hot springs and soothing thermal waters. The springs here are known for being rich in sulphur and nitrogen that can be used to treat a range of health issues, and are naturally heated underground. Back in the day, the waters were discovered and used by the Romans who believed in their healing properties, so don’t miss the chance to soak in a Roman bath in Les Escaldes. Aside from the waters, visitors can also check out Les Escaldes fortress named Capilla Sant Roma, as well as take in the views over the town from the Pont dels Escalls Bridge, a place of historical significance that makes you feel as if you have stepped back in time. "
Valira D’Orient,"Due to its size and compact geography, Andorra is easily visited by car, and tours are common here to allow guests the chance to explore different areas of the region. As you move through the Valira d’Orient Valley you will find charming little towns and villages scattered over the region, as well as period buildings that seem to emerge out of nowhere. These include the San Miquel Engloasters, a Pyrenean church that is yet another stunning example of the Romanesque style. Located nearby the church is Lake Engloasters, an artificial lake that offers fishing and boating opportunities, and the surrounding scenery makes this the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll and a picnic. "
Santa Coloma,"As you drive from Andorra in the direction of the border with Spain, you will find the sleepy yet dainty village of Santa Coloma, which is known for the Santa Coloma church, another Romanesque building in Andorra that’s unusual due to its circular rather than square shape. The church dates from the 9th century, and visitors travel here for its ornate features such as a statue, said to date from the 12th century, of the Virgin of Coloma. There are also some splendid frescoes on display as well as ornate arches, and a font said to date from medieval times. Also in Santa Coloma is the Sant Vicenç d’Enclar Castle, built in the 12th century, and just a short walk from Santa Coloma Church. The location of the castle is stunning, as it sits atop the Roc d’Enclar, and stands guard over the village below. "
Centre Termolúdic Caldea,"When you visit Andorra la Vella it probably won’t take you long to find the Centre Termolúdic Caldea, a towering pyramid made from glass that easily pierces the city’s skyline. The centre is also notable for being the largest spa complex in the whole of Europe, and stretches over 6,000 square metres so that guests have plenty of room to enjoy all that the spa has to offer. There are both indoor and outdoor lagoon areas for guests to swim and float in, as well as sauna, hot tubs, and a range of in-house features that provide unique treatments. Some of these include mini-waterfalls to massage tired muscles, marble treatment rooms that are said to have healing properties, and Roman style baths. The waters in the spa are packed with minerals and originate from a thermal source under the city. "
Canillo,"If you are looking to get back to Andorra’s roots then make for the charming village of Canillo. To the north of the village you will find the Sant Joan de Caselles Chapel, built in the 11th century in the Romanesque style. Constructed from local stone, the chapel has made its mark due to its exquisite craftsmanship that includes a range of preserved frescoes and sculptures including one of Jesus Christ made from stucco. A visit to the chapel also combines well with a walk in the countryside to take in the spectacular scenery that Andorra is famous for, as well as an opportunity to try the local fare in one of the rustic local restaurants that dot the area. "
La Massana,"Come to La Massana in the winter months if you want to experience some outdoor premium sports and enjoy some fun in the snow. La Massana is larger in size than most other ski resorts in Andorra, and is found at an elevation of 1500 metres, although its slopes continue up to 2500 metres. There are 89 kilometres of downhill ski trails including 41 pistes, and 26 ski lifts. The resort is also joined via ski lifts to other ski areas such as Arisanal. Depending on your fitness levels and enthusiasm, you can go skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and even try your hand at a combination of skiing and paragliding! "
Ordino,"For those who want to explore more of the Valira del Nord Valley, the town of Ordino is an essential stop off point. The town lies at the base of the Casamanya Mountain and has a laid back atmosphere and a rustic charm. One of the top draws in Ordino is the Casa Plairal d’Areny de Plandolit, the former home of Baron de Senaller, that originally dates from the 17th century. Visitors can tour the house and enjoy the period touches such as an ornate iron balcony, and even a former armoury that includes a barrel-organ. As you move through the home you will also find a historic blacksmith’s studio, a library that features coats of arms of famous families in Andorra, a private chapel, and even a period bakery. Other things to look out for are original copies of the national anthem of Andorra in the music room, as well as the decorated private chapel. "
Porto de Luanda,"The capital of Angola is full of stark contrasts. The beautiful Atlantic Ocean views are disrupted by busy ships and the high rise modern looking buildings are contrasted by lean to huts built to accommodate people in the rapidly expanding city. Over-population is apparent in other ways too, namely the insane morning traffic and the stink that regularly trouble the city. Despite all these problems however, Luanda certainly has its charms and is another side to Africa that is worth experiencing. "
Kissama National Park,"Only a 70km ride south from Luanda is the Parque Nacional de Kissama, a wildlife sanctuary that has utilized stunning natural settings to protect and preserve many African species. The park began life as a nature reserve in 1938 and subsequently evolved into a National Park in 1957. During the Civil War years, the park was neglected and fell victim to poaching but its population of buffalo, elephants and even sea turtles are now going strong. The park even received 10 Elephants by air mail from Russia in 2000. "
Tunda Vala Volcanic Fissure,"The Tundavala Fissure is one of the most spectacular natural sights in Angola. It can be found between the cities of Lubango and Namibe at an elevation of 2,600m above sea level. At this height it goes without saying that the views are phenomenal and the visible vistas are some of the best on offer in Africa. Commonly reached by thrill seeking hikers, the view of the descent back down to sea level is dizzying steep. As well as the sheer rock faces the Tundavala also has patches of savanna, grass and forest landscapes. "
Dilolo Lake,"This mythical lake can be found in Moxico, eastern Angola. It is the largest lake in the country and serves as an important tourist spot. Despite being situated just outside of the Cameia Park boundaries, the lake is teeming with wildlife including rare bird species and aquatic life. The lake is an impressive 12km in length and sits at roughly 1000m above sea level. The reason for the myths surrounding this lake are the unusual waves that always head to the east of the lake. In folklore these waves are believed to be a supernatural force to scare people from fishing the lake. If you fancy a dip in the lake, September is the best month with pleasant temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius. "
Chiumbe River Falls,"Situated in Lunda Sol, the Dala Waterfalls are about 60m high and conjure a spectacular scene with the mist and spray created from the crashing of the water on the rocks below. The waterfalls can be comfortably viewed from a bridge near the base of the falls or, for those who truly love the scene, a hotel is built only 50m away from the waterfalls. The waterfalls, also referred to as the Chiumbe River falls, should not be confused with the Cassengo falls which are smaller but situated in the same area of Angola. "
Benguela,The city of Benguela in western Angola is situated on a bay of the same name and is an important tourist destination for the country. The early economy of the city was established on mining and then the slave trade to Cuba and Brazil. Tourism is actively promoted in the city and an international railway is located nearby. The main attractions of the city are its beautiful ocean-side location coupled with the breathtaking Portuguese architecture. The beaches are fantastic places to unwind and the people are very friendly. 
Maiombe Forest,"The Maiombe Forest is one of the most spectacular natural areas in Angola. It boasts more than 400 square km of forest and is rather fittingly referred to as the &#8220;Amazon of Africa&#8221;. The forest is a fantastic location for wildlife lovers with hundred of rare species, many of them unique to the area. Animals include gorillas, elephants, chimps, rare birds and butterflies. The woods in the forest are equally as rare as the animals and include ebony and mahogany. The biggest town in the reserve, Buco Zau, has a small guesthouse with basic facilities for those wishing to fully immerse themselves in the nature. "
Porto do Lobito,"The port and town of Lobito is situated within Benguela and is both an important part of the export and the tourist economy. The port and coastline here are popular with anglers trying to land a whopping Giant Tarpon which can weigh up to 200lbs. For the less extreme, the beach here is a great place to relax and watch the sunset or there are plenty of restaurants and old Portuguese buildings here which can be worth taking the time to explore for a day or two. "
Iona National Park,"The largest national park in Angola, the Iona National Park is situated in the most southwesterly point of the country. It covers an expansive area of over 15,000 square kilometers. Although the national parks were hit hard by illegal animal poaching during the civil war, efforts to replace and restore the wildlife in the park are underway. As well as animals such as Springbok, Ostrich and Cheetah, the park is also home to indigenous people who, according to scientists are the most &#8220;culturally intact&#8221; people on the continent. "
Cangandala National Park,"Another beautiful area of National Park in Angola, the Cangandala National Park is the smallest of the parks in Angola but it still has plenty to offer. The area is home to the amazing giant sable antelope, the rarest antelope in the world and the national symbol of Angola. The park is well served with road access and airports within the province. The park, like many others in Angola faces a battle against illegal poaching and many ongoing efforts are ongoing in order to protect the park and indigenous wildlife. "
Mupa National Park,"The Mupa National Park was originally founded in 1964 whilst the area was still a Portuguese colony. The main purpose of the park was to protect a sub species of the giraffe however these were all sadly wiped out: mainly due to landmines left over from the civil war. Other mammals within the park include wild dogs, lions, leopards and hyenas. The park is also a haven for a variety of rare bird life although mineral mining is currently a threat to these species. "
Huambo,"Huambo is a large province in Angola with 11 municipalities and a population of around 1.7 million people. The climate in Huambo is tropical with a dry and cold season and a hot, wet season. The National Forest Reserve of Kavongue can be found in the province and is a great place for adventurers with many taking to the reserve for activities such as rappelling, canyoning, paragliding and canoeing. The city of Huambo is industrial and has its roots in mining. "
Cabinda,"This oil rich city in Angola has been marred somewhat by the shooting of the Togo national football team during the Africa Cup of Nations in 2010. It is also rather a difficult place to obtain a visa to visit, however if this can be overcome, the city and province have some exceptional spots worth visiting. The M&#8217;Buco-M&#8217;Buadi Cemetery houses the remains of Cabinda kings as well as a range of marvelous sculptures. There are also ruins of a 16th Century cathedral and the forest reserve of Kakongo. "
Malanje,"As well as being home to the Cangandala National Park mentioned earlier, the province of Malanje is also home the Black Stones of Pungo Adongo; a strange stone natural rock formation formed over millions of years. The area is also home to many waterfalls, forests and natural areas which all make for great places to take safaris or try out an extreme excursion such as canyoning or bungee jumping. "
Buenos Aires,"The sprawling, seething capital of Argentina rose on the banks of the Rio del Plata when Iberian seafarer Pedro de Mendoza first marked out the colonial streets of what is today San Telmo district; Buenos Aires’ gorgeous Spanish come Francophone-styled historic heart, where Baroque churches rub shoulders with Parisian cafes populated by artists and bohemian types. The artsy district of La Boca, meanwhile, shimmering with multicolours, draws crowds to its galleries and boutiques, while Palermo pulses with dance shows and aromatic parrillas (casual roadside grills with perfect gaucho meat cuts). And then there’s the night time, ushering in one throbbing scene of tango and Latin jazz, sleepless dub bars and all-night steakhouses. Yes sir, there’s plenty to fall in love with in uber-passionate BA! "
"Cordoba, Argentina","Cordoba’s UNESCO-attested center is a gorgeous patchwork of 17th-century Spanish churches and convents, Jesuit sites and cobblestone alleys, all nestled between the rolling plains of the Argentine Pampas and the half-baked ridges of the Sierras Chicas. But a fine historical heart is not Cordoba’s only draw. No sir, students still flock here to the lecture rooms of the National University of Cordoba &#8211; the oldest and one of the most prestigious in the nation. This erudite population breathes life into paleontological museums and the Caraffa Fine Arts Museum alike, theatre productions and public art displays, all whilst fuelling a particularly hedonistic nightlife in the Ex Abasto area. "
San Antonio de Areco,"Set on the cusp of the gaucho heartland, where the rolling plains of the grass-clad Pampas claim the horizon, San Antonio de Areco is one truly handsome Argentine town. Elegant colonial builds from the 1700s line the streets; their red-tiled roofs slanting in an Andalusian fashion; their Baroque adornments mirroring the palazzos of Madrid. Swaying palms and ombu trees pepper the squares, where earthy steakhouses mix with leather workshops and weavers’ homes. This rustic outback town is a great place to get a taste of Argentina’s rich cowboy history, and perfect if you love the sleepy siesta routines of the Pampas hinterland! "
Mendoza,"Jack of all trades and master of one, Mendoza does nothing better than wine. Tasters flock from all over the planet to sample the famed Criolla Grande and Malbecs betwixt the city’s cellar doors. But that isn’t it. This 100,000-strong cityscape is also one darn charming place to spend a week (or two), edged right up to the Argentine Andes. Its streets are lined with blooming shade trees, parks ring their way around the bodegas, and Plaza Espana – as the name suggests – oozes Spanish charm. And as if that’s still not enough, Mendoza has risen as one of Argentina’s prime outdoors bases, rivalling even Patagonia with its offering of soaring Aconcagua, the treeless plateaus of the high plains and ski fields to boot. "
Ushuaia,"Icy and alone at the far reaches of the Argentine south, Ushuaia sits in the shadow of the snow-topped Martial ranges. Here it can be found cascading down to the chilly waters of the Beagle Channel, its docksides awash with fishing vessels and hardy steel sloops bobbing about the waves. Today, travelers flock to this remote town – considered the southernmost city in the world – on the meandering tracks of the so-called End of the World Train, which cuts right the way through the main attraction: Tierra del Fuego National Park. After stocking up on boots and camping gear in the outfitters of Ushuaia, travelers can strike out into this Patagonian wilderness, spying the Martial Glacier, rugged Lapataia Bay and mirror-like Lago Roca on the border with Chile. "
San Ignacio Mini,"Close to the tristate join of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, amidst the red-hued fields and yerba plantations of Misiones Province, travelers will discover the fascinating ruins of San Ignacio Mini. Tagged by UNESCO back in 1983, this collection of crumbling cloisters and church walls, living quarters and cemeteries is one of the prime examples of what’s come to be known as the Guarani Baroque style. Fusing together elements of tribal art and craft and regal Spanish architecture, the remains belie the curious meeting of cultures that took place here during the decades of the Conquistadores, and are regular chart toppers on lists of Argentina’s must-see attractions. "
"El Calafate, Argentina","Standing pearly-white like a peppermint against the deep blues and rugged rock granite ridges of the Los Glaciares National Park, the ice-carved bulwarks of the Perito Moreno Glacier are a real wonder to behold. Almost singlehandedly have they thrust the far-flung backwater town of El Calafate into the limelight, and today thousands of intrepid travelers make their way to the Patagonian backcountry around the city, eager to seek out bobbing ice bergs and the crags of Onelli Bay alike. The settlement has grown up in recent decades too, going from a wool trader outpost to a series of paved streets lined with outdoors outfitters, quaint timber homes and the cutting-edge exhibitions of the Glaciarium. "
Puerto Iguazu,"The last little taste of Argentina before crossing the border into Brazil or Paraguay is a friendly enough place, complete with oodles of well-honed hotels and guesthouses, more than its fair share of restaurants, and souvenir shops ten to the penny. But that’s not why so many people come here. No sir, they come in droves for the roaring cataracts of the Iguazu Falls, which cascade over the cliffs close by. Trips to the bucket-list waterfalls are uber-easy to organise, with a tourist train weaving through the jungles and designated walking paths opening up onto the famous Devil&#8217;s Throat section of the site, where the waters crash a whopping 82 meters from top to bottom. Remember the waterproofs! "
El Chalten,"Dramatic broadsides of the mighty Fitz Roy peaks delineate the horizon at El Chalten; a town of low-rise cottages and Austrian-esque guesthouses that’s perched right up on the edge of the Patagonian Andes and the northern icefields of Los Glaciares. The de facto trekking capital of the nation, the spot is packed with walkers and hikers and mountaineers, all coming in search of trails like the Laguna de los Tres and Condor Mirador, which soar high above the town and close to the towering peaks that encase it. A spa is at hand for any who want to sooth the muscles post-adventure, while a clutch of breweries and backpacker bars makes for an interesting evening complete with pilsners and black beers. "
San Carlos de Bariloche by Albertina,"Argentina’s answer to New Zealand’s Queenstown, France’s Chamonix and all the world’s other alpine, outdoorsy gems comes in the form of San Carlos de Bariloche (that’s just Bariloche to the locals and regulars). Hugging the sparkling waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake, the town is encompassed by verdant swathes of lengas and Chilean cedar and bamboo. Luxurious hotels looking plucked straight out of Geneva meet wooden snow cabins between the city streets, while Swiss chocolatiers belie the town’s long Germanic historical connection – as does the glorious Gothic cathedral! Skiing at Cerro Catedral causes the town to boom during the colder months, as riders come in search of one of the continent’s largest ski areas, complete with 120 kilometers of groomed piste. "
Mar del Plata,"Chock-a-block with sunbathers and fashionistas, volleyball hitters and Atlantic swell swimmers right throughout the summer, Mar del Plata is the Argentinian seaside resort extraordinaire. The early decades of the 1900s was when the beaches here made their name, giving a golden age that’s still visible in the occasional Art Deco high-rise along the shore. Today, del Plata pumps to the tune of electric tango each evening, the throbbing cocktail bars of Alem Street drawing the biggest crowds. Fantastic fish eateries also abound, while Mirador Waikiki offers something a little more secluded than the major sand stretches that line the city. "
Puerto Madryn,"A town of sloping beaches and windswept Atlantic dunes, where the rugged, seal-spotted coves of Chubut Province meld together between the Valdes Peninsula and Punta Ninfas, Puerto Madryn is one part sunbather paradise (great if you fancy leaving behind the booming crowds of Mar del Plata!), one part whale watchers’ mecca. The great mammals (southern right whales to be precise) flock to the shore during the colder months, and can be seen from the rocky headlands around town, while summertime draws Buenos Aires locals to its less-trodden inlets and the penguin-packed rocks of Punta Tombo alike. Welsh heritage is very much alive here too, so don’t be shocked if you hear the odd diolch mixed in with the Spanish! "
Antofagasta de la Sierra,"A whopping 3,200 meters above sea level, amidst the coal-coloured cinder cones of the Puna and the colossal caldera tops of Galan, Antofagasta de la Sierra is a whole world away from the ice-caked Patagonian wilds and the grasslands of the Pampas. Here, dust devils twirl in the air and the sweeping Andean plateaus are interrupted only by the occasional bump of an ancient volcano. Llama calls are the backing track, and farmers squeeze a living from the wastelands and the high-altitude lakes. Antofagasta itself is little more than a village, the prime gateway to this truly breathtaking region of Argentina, although increasing annual visitor numbers are slowly beginning to change things. "
Trevelin,"Trevelin rose in the wake of the fabled Welsh explorer and settler El Baqueano, who used this spot as a base for his intrepid excursions in the Pampas during the 1890s. Today, this curious little backwater settlement still remembers its Celtic roots with pride, and the Welsh tongue still echoes amidst the pretty, tree-lined streets. In fact, spots like the Dyffryn y Merthyron pay homage to the fallen heroes of the Welsh frontier caravans, while cakes straight out of Brecon feature heavily on the menus of the quaint tearooms in town. The setting is beautiful too, as the rising peaks of the Andes dominate to the west and the Chubut lowlands roll out, undulating forever into the east. "
"Salta, Argentina","Salta can be found spread out along the base of the dust-caked, ochre-hued Lerma Valley, a mass of square-cut blocks and traffic-choked streets that hides one magnificent colonial core at its heart. Yes sir, expect palm-peppered plazas like Julio Square and Ninth of July Plaza, where al fresco cafes throb with Spanish chatter, curious tango-folk and the smells of yerba mate, theatres twinkle in lights and elegant Baroque frontispieces ooze with tales of the town’s 500 years of history. Of course, the backcountry is another draw (it always is in Argentina), and after devouring all the empanadas possible, many travelers make a beeline for the wild Valles Calchaquies, or even across the Andes, to the saltpans of southern Bolivia! "

"
Whitaker Point,"Whitaker Point is a beautiful Arkansas that has appeared in Disney movies, as well as a journalist’s article regarding the best places to be kissed! No wonder. The jagged outcrop itself is as old as time—it has seen countless proposals through the generations. It offers views that will leave you speechless. Beware, though, for Whitaker Point is as dangerous as it is beautiful. The edge of the rock is steeper and narrower than you’d first think, and this beauty spot has seen tragedy in its time. "
Roark&#8217;s Bluff,"Roark’s Bluff towers over the Arkansas skyline as if defending the area from an unknown enemy. The surrounding area is stunning, especially in the fall when the tree line is tinted with earthen color and the leaves crackle underfoot.

Pinnacle Mountain,"Soaring over 1,000 feet over the Arkansas River Valley, Pinnacle Mountain, and its surrounding state park are must-see natural wonders for any and all outdoors enthusiasts. With two hiking trails leading to the summit, the view from the top is even better than the view from the park!

"Old Mill Park, Little Rock","Otherwise known as T.R Pugh Memorial Park and hidden away in North Little Rock, you’ll find a recreation of a nineteenth-century grist mill among the tranquil, natural beauty of this area.

Bowers Hollow Falls,"Hidden away in the Upper Buffalo Wilderness, you’ll find Arkansas’ most beautiful wet-weather waterfalls. At over 56’, seeing water crash over its jagged, yet beautiful, precipice is an out of this world experience. While visiting the falls, you’ll be enveloped by the natural and rugged beauty of the Ozark National Forest.

"Buffalo River Waterfall, Arkansas","The Natural State, Arkansas, has an abundance of lakes and waterways—and thanks to the jagged and tough terrain, those waterways have provided the state with some of the most impressive natural waterfalls available in North America. On almost any trail in the Ouachita or Ozark Mountain ranges, you’re sure to come across a waterfall or two. Just remember that as beautiful as they may be, they can be deadly, so do be careful!

Magnolia Falls,"Compared to other waterfalls situated in Arkansas, Magnolia Falls is somewhat short in stature, 26’ at its highest point. What it lacks in size, however, it more than makes up for with its rugged beauty.

"
Hemmed-in-Hollow Falls,"Arkansas’ biggest waterfall, standing at a massive 210’, Hemmed-in-Hollow Falls is one of the most visited natural spots in the entire state. The trail leading to this magnificent waterfall is tough—a 1,400 descent all the way down, with poor footing and jagged outcrops in abundance. Ensure that you err on the side of caution while you navigate this trail; it really can humble the most experienced hiking parties. Despite the difficulty, Hemmed-in-Hollow is well worth the visit—if only to see water crash to the Earth from such an immense height. "
Blanchard Springs Caverns,"Blanchard Springs is well known for its fishing, hiking, and swimming trails. However, there’s more right beneath your feet! Entering the underground domain of the Blanchard Springs Caves will take your breath away—the jagged, rough formations of rock are truly a sight to behold. The entire subterranean system is akin to something you might read in a novel about Dwarves, Goblins, and other creatures that reside in the world of fantasy. "
Buffalo River Near Ponca,"The section of the Buffalo River between Ponca and Kyles Landing is deemed by many to be the most scenic float of the entire 150 mile-long waterway, and it’s easy to see why!

"
"Yerevan, Armenia","By far the largest city in Armenia, the capital Yerevan is a great place to start for anyone wishing to explore Armenia. The city is home to the grand Republic Square, while climbing the Cascade to see the city&#8217;s monument to Soviet victory in the Second World War is a must. Yerevan is a deeply historic city and visiting the Armenian Genocide Memorial is a must to learn more about the nation&#8217;s troubled past. Vernissage flea market is worth visiting too &#8211; it is open at the weekend &#8211; while a walk through the Hrazdan gorge is also highly recommended. Much of what Armenia has to offer can be explored during day trips from Yerevan, which is known as the City of Cafes. Yerevan is also home to Blue Mosque, which is the only mosque in the whole of the country, as well as Levon&#8217;s Amazing Underground World, which is one of Europe&#8217;s most unusual attractions.

The reserve also has a number of very beautiful waterfalls to enjoy. "

Windsurfing is among the recreation activities available at the lake, which also has a wide choice of excellent seafood restaurants along its shore. Lake Sevan has a number of popular beaches and, as the country has no coastline, this is the best place in Armenia to sunbathe, with Sevan Bay and its surrounding mountains providing spectacular scenery. "
Dilijan national park,"Armenia has four national parks and Dilijan national park may be the most beautiful of the lovely quartet. The park, which was only established in 2002, is famous for its medicinal mineral water springs, as well as its natural monuments. Many of Armenia&#8217;s more important cultural locations can be found within the grounds of the park, such as Haghartsin Monastery, Goshavank Monastery  and Jukhtak Vank, as well as Matosavank Monastery and the Akhnabat church. The Aghestev and Getik river basins are also both within the boundaries of Dilijan national park. "
Mount Aragats,"Mount Aragats is one of Armenia&#8217;s most stunning natural sights, with the dormant volcano located in the north of the country. It is Armenia&#8217;s highest peak and there is a lot of rock art to be enjoyed around its base, with paintings of animals and human-like figures dating back hundreds of years. Snow covers the peak almost all year-round but Mount Aragats can be climbed, with July, August and September the best times of the year to attempt the hike. The southernmost of the four peaks is the easiest to climb, while the northern peak, at around 4,000 metres, is the most challenging. "
Lake Arpi,"While Lake Sevan can be extremely crowded during the peak tourist season, Lake Arpi has a much more relaxed feel. Used for irrigation and hydropower production, Lake Arpi is also the source of the Akhurian River. In 2009 a new park was established around the lake to protect the natural environment, with around 100 species of birds known to live in the area. Lake Arpi also hosts rich flora and fauna and is a Ramsar Convention protected site. Lake Arpi has one the largest colonies of Armenian Gull and its recreation activities include camping and walking tours. "
Noravank,"Monasteries are one of Armenia&#8217;s defining characteristics and the example at Noravank is one of the most beautiful in the whole country. Sheer brick-red cliffs shield the monastery, which was built in the 13th century. Noravank is famous for its Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) church, while the story goes that the monastery was saved by God himself when Armenia was conquered by the Mongols hundreds of years ago. If you only choose to go to one monastery during a trip to Armenia, Noravank would be an extremely good selection &#8211; thousands of people visit every year. "
Gyumri City Hall,"The second largest city in Armenia, Gyumri is well worth a visit for anyone heading to the country for the first time. Perhaps the best place from which to enjoy the sights of Gyumri is from the Black Fortress on the hill that overlooks the city, while the massive Mother Armenia statue can also be found nearby.

Although Vanadzor is primarily an industrial city, it also houses many theatres, such as the Bohem Chamber Theatre of Vanadzor and the Vanadzor Puppet Theatre. "
Amberd Fortress,"Dating back to the seventh century, Amberd Fortress is one of the most stunning places to visit in Armenia. Formerly among the Armenian Kingdom&#8217;s primary military-defensive points, the fortress can be reached in about an hour from the capital city Yerevan. However, snowfall can make the fortress inaccessible during the winter months, with the weather usually improving by late May. The view from the top of the fortress is truly breathtaking, while the building itself is also stunning. Amberd Fortress is a short trip from the village of Byurakan, home of the Byurakan Observatory. "
Tsaghkadzor,"Armenia&#8217;s mountainous scenery makes it ideal for winter sports and the country&#8217;s best ski resort can be found at Tsaghkadzor in the heart of the country. Ski lifts are paid for by the ride and are among the most affordable in Europe. Tsaghkadzor boasts some of the finest hotels in the country, while the resort also has one of the nation&#8217;s biggest entertainment centers in the form of the Senator Royale casino complex.

Geghart Monastery,"The Upper Azat Valley is one of Armenia&#8217;s World Heritage Sites, partly due to the incredible Geghard Monastery for which the region is most famous. The main chapel was built 800 years ago but the history of the monastery goes all the way back to the fourth century, when it was founded by Gregory the Illuminator. According to legend, the Geghard Monastery once housed one of the spears that was used to crucify Jesus Christ, brought to Armenia by Apostle Thaddeus, and as such it is one of Armenia&#8217;s most important religious sites. The Upper Azat Valley is also home to the St Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) chapel, which is partially carved out of the rock. "
Karahunj Observatory,"Often referred to internationally as Armenia&#8217;s version of Britain&#8217;s Stonehenge, Karahunj is one of the most fascinating places to visit during a break in Armenia. Located close to the city of Sisian in the Syunik province, Karahunj is made up of well over 200 massive stone tombs, while the main area sees 40 stones standing in a circular formation, supposedly built in honour of the Armenian main God, Ari, named after the Sun. A small museum in Sisian is dedicated to findings that have been made at Karahunj, which is claimed to be the oldest observatory of its kind in the world. "
"Khor Virap, Armenia","Views of Mount Ararat can be enjoyed from all over Armenia, but perhaps the best scenery of the mountain can be found from the Khor Virap monastery, which is definitely also worth visiting in its own right. This location is one of the most important historic sites in Armenia&#8217;s history as it was where Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned for 14 years before he cured King Trdat III of his disease. The King then converted to Christianity, paving the way for Armenia&#8217;s religious future. As such, Khor Virap is a popular spot for Armenian weddings today, while the underground chamber in which Gregory the Illuminator was held can be visited during a trip to Khor Virap, which is among Armenia&#8217;s most visited pilgrimage sites as a result. "
Ruins of Ancient Dvin,"Our final selection for the best places to visit in Armenia is Dvin, one of the country&#8217;s oldest cities &#8211; in fact, it was the capital of Armenia in medieval times. A sixth century BC fortress was also once situated in Dvin, according to Unesco, while incredible artefacts are regularly found in this part of Armenia. More modern sights can also be enjoyed in the city, such as the St. Harutyun Church in Dvin, which was built in 2000. Dvin once housed the Cathedral of St. Grigor, but all that remains of the building today is the stone foundations that have been uncovered by archeologists. "
Sydney,"Perhaps Australia’s best-known tourist destination, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-sydney-australia/"">Sydney</a> is the gateway city for many tourists, as well as being the largest city in Australia. A vibrant metropolis of over 4 million, Sydney is famous for its excellent cuisine, nightlife, shopping, and cultural attractions; and, of course, the Sydney Opera House! You’ll want to spend at least a few days here, but if you’re in a rush, some of the best inner-city attractions are the Powerhouse Museum, Manly, Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Paddington Markets, Taronga Zoo, and the Royal Botanic Gardens. Or catch the hop-on, hop-off bus – with 34 designated stops, and insightful commentary, you’ll see some of Sydney’s most popular sites and have a great time! "
the National Gallery of Australia,"The capital city of Australia is nestled neatly between New South Wales and Victoria, the two most populated states – as you may imagine, it was chosen as a compromise between the notoriously competitive Sydney and Melbourne. Being the nation’s capital, the quality of the local museums and galleries are exceptional, so it’s a real treat for the arts and culture-minded; the National Museum of Australia and the National Gallery of Australia are must-sees, with many international exhibits. A tour of the beautiful Parliament House will give you a fascinating insight in Australia’s history and politics, and the Canberra Glassworks is as gorgeous as it is fascinating. The National Dinosaur museum is a great place to bring the kids (or to get in touch with your inner child!). Once you’ve whetted your intellectual appetite, it’s time to enjoy the beautiful nature of the Canberra area – the city is even nicknamed the “bush capital”! Black Mountain, the National Botanic Gardens, and the Canberra Nature Park are particularly interesting. "
Brisbane,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-brisbane-australia/"">Brisbane</a> is particularly popular with Australian tourists, but also beloved by travelers from abroad. It’s a charming city that criss-crosses the Brisbane River, and its boutique shopping, friendly atmosphere and delicious restaurants can’t be beat.

West End is a popular nightlife spot, with the Lychee Lounge’s famous craft cocktails, and South Bank is a beautiful sightseeing spot that boasts everything from an authentic Nepalese Pagoda to an artificial inner-city beach. Try to visit during South Bank’s Collective Markets for some gorgeous handmade, artisanal objects by local creatives. "
Byron Bay,"These two towns, 70km from each other, are Australia’s alternative lifestyle hub; they were the centre of the Australian hippie movement, and you’ll still find hippie culture (and hippies, young and old!) here today. Byron Bay has a gorgeous beach and lighthouse, but it’s also become much more commercialized than Nimbin (which is inland, so no beach, but the colorful streetscape and unique atmosphere more than make up for it). Despite being in New South Wales, they’re very close to the border with Queensland; at only 2 hours from Brisbane, they’re a really fun day trip. "
Gold Coast,"Just under 100km from Brisbane, this tourist mecca is glitzy, exciting and fun: it’s Australia’s answer to Las Vegas (and yes, there’s a casino!) This beach resort town is best known for Surfers Paradise (home of the famous bikini-clad meter maids, the futuristic Infinity attraction and an excellent Madam Tussauds), as well as its theme parks (Sea World, Dream World, Warner Bros Movie World and Wet’n’Wild), but if glitz, kitsch and rollercoasters aren’t your thing, then you’ll love the stunning, unspoiled rainforest vistas of Springbook &amp; Lamington National Parks, and the very charming Mount Tamborine with its handicrafts, wines and cheeses. "
Port Douglas,"Port Douglas is a quaint seaside village, and a great place to relax on the beach or take a stroll; Cairns is a buzzing tourist mecca that’s popular with backpackers from around the world. They’re about an hour away from each other, and either is a great place to base yourself while enjoying the jewels in the crown of this area, two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Great Barrier Reef, and the Daintree Rainforest. The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest reef system, spanning 2,600km, and including 2,900 reefs and 900 islands. As one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, it’s a fascinating spot for snorkelling or scuba diving: the corals come in a myriad of colors and shapes, and the waters are rich in beautiful marine life. The Daintree Rainforest is home to some of the world’s oldest forests, and is known for its exceptional diversity of flora and fauna, and its beautiful walking trails. Being quite heavily touristed, you can find all of the necessities or luxuries here, including several eco-spas to relax and unwind in after all of that bushwalking! "
Perth,"Once a sleepy backwater, Perth has completely revamped itself since the Western Australian mining boom, and is now a very fun site for tourists and locals alike. At Elizabeth Quay, you can stroll along the Swan River while dolphin-spotting, or check out any of its excellent restaurants or bars at (Annalakshmi is particularly outstanding!); it’s also gorgeous at night, when the bridge is illuminated. Matilda Bay Reserve and its iconic blue boathouse is walking distance from the Quay, as is the University of Western Australia campus with its gorgeous architecture – Winthrop Hall is particularly worth a look, and you may even see a bride and groom milling around as it’s a popular spot for wedding photos. Perth’s coastline is considered some of Australia’s best; in total, WA’s coastline stretches for 12,000km, making it the longest stretch of coastline in Australia. The West Coast sunsets are a must-see, and there’s plenty of nice spots for beachside fish and chips. Mindarie Marina and Hillary’s Boat Harbour are a little difficult to access by public transport, but well worth it: the Marina has a gorgeous Mediterranean-style boardwalk, the Boat Harbour is home to Perth’s aquarium, and both sites have some fantastic restaurants. Further south, Fremantle’s beautiful heritage buildings, buzzing markets, and vibrant bar and café culture make it a must on every Perth visitor’s itinerary; and if you’ve got time for a trip out of Perth, the nearby Rottnest Island is famous for a marsupial found nowhere else, known as the quokka –you may have heard of the quokka selfies phenomenon! It’s worth staying overnight on the island as they’re most active at night (and they’re particularly adorable at night-time in Spring, when the mothers are nursing their young). "
Coral Bay,"If you’re visiting Western Australia, Coral Bay is a must-see, if you’re up to the 11-hour drive from Perth or 13-hour drive from Broome to get there! On the upside, it’s an interesting journey if you’re traveling up from Perth: Geraldtown, Kalbarri, the UNESCO-listed Hamelin Pool, or the famous dolphins of Monkey Mia are all short and easy detours. Ningaloo Reef is the highlight of Coral Bay; it’s Australia’s only fringing reef, and the coral starts right at the seashore. The fish and coral are very easy to get to, even for the kids, and it’s a great spot for snorkelling or diving. If you’re lucky, you might also spot Solo the Kangaroo (a roo who loves swimming (very unusual!) and has become quite a favorite with the townspeople) or some nesting turtles. Whale-watching tours are also available. "
Uluru,"Uluru, also known as Ayer’s Rock, is a massive sandstone rock formation in the Northern Territory. It’s listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and highly sacred in the local indigenous culture (who do request that you do not climb it). The rock appears to change colors at different times of day, and it’s a spectacular backdrop for photographs of your Australian roadtrip. The area surrounding the rock is also very interesting: walking tours led by the traditional inhabitants of the area, the Aṉangu, will leave you well-informed about local bush-tucker (indigenous cuisine), dreamtime stories, flora and fauna. You can also see archaeological evidence of 10,000 years of human habitation in the area. Uluru is part of the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park, and the flora found here is quite a comprehensive sample of that which is found in Central Australia. There’s also a diverse range of native wildlife, so it’s a great chance to encounter marsupials and other Australian mammals in their natural habitat. "
Kakadu National Park,"Kakadu is another highlight of the Northern Territory. Covering an area of almost 20,000 square kilometres, Australia’s largest national park is the size of Slovenia, or almost half the size of Switzerland. Kakadu is another of Australia’s UNESCO World Heritage sites, and for good reason: the views are spectacular, and the biodiversity is exceptional (with over 280 bird species and 10 thousand insect species, over 1700 plant species, and approximately 60 mammal species and 117 reptile species). Kakadu is also a fascinating experience for the budding archaeologist: the area has been inhabited by the local indigenous population for at least 40,000 years, with evidence of settlement such as over 5,000 ancient art sites. More than 500 Aboriginal Australians live in the park, and they maintain much of their traditional cultures and customs; many are also the traditional owners of the land in which they live. From cliffs and gorges to billabongs and waterfalls, there’s a diverse range of scenery to enjoy here, and the flora is particularly stunning. You can also see many native mammals, from dugongs to dingos! As you might expect from the size of the park, there are countless tourist attractions, and it’s well worth spending a week here; KakaduTourism.com has a variety of suggested itineraries, and substantial information about the natural and cultural charms of the park. "
Melbourne,"Melbourne is a buzzing metropolis famed for its exceptional café culture – its coffee has been voted the best in the world, beating out Rome and Vienna – as well as its vibrant cultural scene, exciting nightlife, delicious dining options and boutique shopping. Different neighbourhoods have their own culture, and it’s particularly worth visiting Fitzroy, Richmond Road and Chinatown for a taste of what makes Melbourne so special! The Crown Casino complex is also a treat; far more than just a casino, the complex boasts an excellent range of up-market shopping options, 5-star dining, nightclubs and much more. Docklands is also a great place for a coffee or a meal. The state art gallery and museum are both excellent, and the Queen Victoria Markets is a bustling, exciting and delicious attraction. You can also enjoy a stunning view of the city from the Eureka Skydeck, but perhaps the most fun to be had in Melbourne is just wandering through the many laneways and arcades in the city and experiencing its unique atmosphere. "
Great Ocean Road,"Starting at the cute township of Torquay (famous for its surf beaches, including the world-famous Bells Beach), this Australian Heritage-listed, 243km stretch of road boasts gorgeous coastal and mountain views, pristine white-sand beaches, a collection of small Australian towns that are fascinating in their own right, and the iconic Twelve Apostles (a series of limestone formations standing tall in the ocean). Stop in a few towns on your way, and make sure to take the time to explore the Great Otway National Park (if you’re a daredevil, maybe even try the zipline!) "
Barossa Valley,"The city of Adelaide and the nearby Barossa Valley are popular tourist destinations; Adelaide is known for its funky atmosphere, beautiful scenery, excellent museums and galleries, and Rundle Mall (Australia’s first pedestrian mall). There’s plenty of examples of classic Australian architecture to enjoy, and more forest parks and walking trails than you can shake a stick at. The Big Rocking Horse, just under an hour from the city centre, is an adorably quirky photo opportunity. Once you’ve finished your Adelaide adventures, the Barossa Valley is an internationally renowned winery region, specializing in Shiraz grapes. Winery tours and cellar-door tastings are widely available, and there’s plenty of exceptional restaurants to enjoy here, as well as farmer’s markets, artisanal goods, and many fascinating cultural and heritage sites. The area was heavily settled by German-Australians, and boasts delicious gourmet meats, breads and pastries in the German style. "
Hobart,"Hobart boasts stunning views of the gorgeous, lush wilderness that Tasmania is famous for; it’s also a great place to enjoy fresh produce, artisanal goods, or a few of the local brews. Mount Wellington is a perfect vantage point, as well as an excellent site for bushwalking or bicycling, and the popular Salamanca Place is always buzzing with places to go and things to do: the Saturday morning Salamanca Markets are a must-see. The waterfront is also perfect for a relaxing stroll, and there’s several excellent museums and galleries to enjoy. "
Cradle Mountain,"Cradle Mountain is Tasmania’s fifth-highest mountain, and its beauty makes it one of Tasmania’s most popular destinations. The mountain rises around the crystal-clear blue waters of Dove Lake, and the (strenuous!) trail from Dove Lake carpark, around the mountain and back takes 6-7 hours: if you’re athletic, this hike is well worth it for the beautiful summit view. The area is rich in flora and fauna, and also noteworthy for its diverse fungi. Even if you’re not the mountain-hiking type, Cradle Mountain is iconic, beautiful and well worth a visit. "
Vienna,"The glorious imperial home of the old Habsburg dynasty that once reigned supreme over the heartlands of Central Europe, Vienna is a medley of majestic Baroque facades, elaborate palaces and romantic parks. In the centre of town the mighty Hofburg spreads its grand and neoclassical wings around the manicured Heldenplatz, while the totemic institutions of the Museumsquartier stand nearby, bursting with works by Klimt, Picasso and Warhol. Then there’s the winding web of streets that forms the Vienna Innere Stadt (old town); home to vaulted cafes and art deco teahouses where the spectres of Freud, Wittgenstein and Trotsky still lurk in the alcoves. Yes sir, Vienna’s simply not to be missed! "
Hochosterwitz Castle,"Soaring more than 170 meters above the rolling fields and pine-clad hills that bubble up so beautifully on the Zollfeld plains between the Julian Alps and the Eastern Alps proper, Hochosterwitz Castle is a Game of Thrones-esque symphony of crenulated bulwarks, spiked turrets and formidable gatehouse keeps. It’s hailed as one of the most magnificent citadels in all of Europe, and boasts a history going back more than 1,000 years, encompassing tales of Carinthian dukes, Habsburg emperors and the fear of Turkish invasions from the east. Travellers can scale to the top of Hochosterwtitz along the old fortified entrance path, passing no fewer than 14 defensive gates as they go and watching as panoramas of Slovenia and East Austria unfold on all sides. "
Grossglockner,"The veritable roof of Austria as a whole makes its home amidst the chiselled summits and rugged peaks of the Hohe Tauern massif. Here, on the very divide between Carinthia and the Zillertal Alps of the Tyrol, the mighty Grossglockner soars to a whopping 3,798 meters above sea level. A symphony of peaks and glacial valleys that rises to the Kleinglockner sub-summit before hitting its highest point on the Grossglockner proper, the mountain is now the second most popular tourist attraction in the country (second only to the Schönbrunn in Vienna). People come to hike in the glorious Alpine landscapes all around the peak, or to traverse the iconic High Alpine Road that hairpins around the Kaiser-Franz-Josefs-Höhe viewpoints and 2,500-meter-high mountain passes. "
Alpbach,"Oft hailed as the most handsome of Austria’s many winter resorts, Alpbach sits more than 1,000 meters up in the midst of the Tyrolean Alps. Surrounded by blooming meadows of buttercups, poppies and rock jasmine by summer and more than 145 kilometers of groomed skiing runs by winter, travelers can explore a medley of timber chalets and traditional Austrian homes adorned with cascading bougainvillea and carved balconies, not to mention the gorgeous St Oswald Church, where the eminent Erwin Schrödinger lays resting. "
Finkenberg,"The charming little Tyrolean town of Finkenberg can be found cascading down a hillside in the depths of the magnificent Zillertal Valley, a medley of rustic timber homes and Austrian taverns that’s draped in pillows of packed snow by winter and enfolded by evergreen Alpine peaks during the warmer months of the year. And aside from its pretty appearance, the quaint little village is also home to the Finkenberger Almbahnen, which transports skiers and boarders to the celebrated pistes of Mayrhofen, while just a little further down the Zillertal, the mighty Hintertux glacier offers year-round snow sports and fantastic panoramas over the Trentino-Alto Alps in Italy to the south! "
Imst,"Nestled in the very heart of the western Tyrol on the central valley of the River Inn, pretty little Imst clings to the base of the Austrian Alps and the downhill pistes of the Hoch-Imst ski area. The town itself is a charming affair of tight-knit roadways watched over by the occasional Germanic church spire or snow-dusted onion dome, while the bucolic surroundings consist of rolling farm fields, soaring limestone summits, sweeping spruce and fir forests, the occasional timber barn and countless winding hiking and mountain biking trails to boot! "
Innsbruck,"Centred on one truly gorgeous Old Town of Baroque palaces and Tyrolean mansions, Innsbruck is every inch the onetime residence of revered Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. Weaving between the cobbled lanes and old imperial palaces left over from Habsburg rule, visitors here can spy out sights like the Golden Roof and the grand whitewashed Hofburg. And then there are armouries to see, and glorious Ambras Castle on the ridges above the city, not to mention the wealth of lively little Bavarian-style beer halls and energetic apres joints touting schnitzel and strudel near the base of the nearby pistes! "
Zell Am See,"Austria’s quintessential Alpine lake town, Zell am See hugs its eponymous cobalt-blue waters right on the edge of the mighty Hohe Tauern ranges. From its enclave of fir-clad ridges and snow-mantled peaks, the spot has become a veritable outdoorsy paradise, drawing millions of adventure travelers each year with the promise of some of Austria’s finest sailing, hiking, mountain biking, scenic driving and – of course – skiing, which takes place mainly on the icecaps of the Kitzsteinhorn above nearby Kaprun. And as if that’s not enough, Zell am See is also home to one seriously handsome centre of ice-cream coloured chalets, while rhododendron and edelweiss bloom from the timber verandas and earthy eateries of Dreifaltigkeitsgasse (the town’s main drag). "
Mondsee,"One of the jewels of the north Austrian lake district that straddles the borders of the Salzburgerland and Upper Austria regions, Mondsee will be recognisable to some as the backdrop to some of the central scenes in The Sound of Music (the famous wedding took place in the historic and beautiful Mondsee Abbey). Gloriously located along the banks of its eponymous lake, shrouded by a phalanx of Alpine peaks – the Drachenwand and the hills of Innerschwand – and loaded with everything from UNESCO-attested cave dwellings to golf courses and sailing clubs, it’s easy to see why this postcard-perfect retreat remains uber-popular amongst locals looking to escape the city. "
Graz,"A glorious Old Town heart and a lively student vibe make Graz one of Austria’s best-loved and most fun-loving cities. Anchored on one seriously attractive Innere Stadt that fuses everything from Renaissance to Gothic to Slavic architectural styles between its cobbled streets and sea of red-tiled roofs, the centre here is awash with fascinating historical sites, like the Schlossberg hill, complete with one curious clock tower, and the Styrian Armoury, where a whopping 32,000 guns, swords, suits of armour and more stand testimony to the city’s onetime place on the frontier between the Ottoman Empire and Western Europe. "
Hallstatt,"The stuff of postcards and travel brochures, Hallstatt has been risen from its valley amidst the gorgeous Salzkammergut to become something of the poster boy for Alpine Austria and its charming medieval towns. It comes complete with terraces of ivy-clad, half-timbered chalets that glow in hues of pink and wood-brown against the reflections of the shimmering Hallstätter See, and is oft hailed as the single most beautiful town in the country. But it’s not all about the looks here: during the first millennium BC the town figured as the centre of a salt mining boom in the Upper Austrian region, and today visitors can spy out the tunnels of the 2,500-year-old Hallein Salt Mine, and a fantastic Heritage Museum that chronicles the ancient history of the town to boot! "
Feldkirch,"Visitors who delve into the alleys and archways, cobbled squares and tight-knit side streets of Feldkirch on the edge of the Austrian Vorarlberg region discover a unique blend of Swiss, Francophone and Germanic heritage. The action centres on fairy-tale Marktgasse, which bustles with authentic beer houses and Rhineland eateries, while it’s the soaring Schattenburg Castle crowning the hillsides just on the edge of town that really draws the eye; a formidable collection of four keeps and fortified bulwarks that was once the home of the Montfort Earls. "
Bad Gastein,"Something of a more regal and straight-laced alternative to the usual Tyrolean timber towns and chalets that pepper the Austrian Alps, Bad Gastein bursts forth from the deep valleys of the Hohe Tauern National Park in an elegant and irresistible medley of Belle Époque and Art Deco. In the middle of the town, the gushing cataracts of the Gastein Waterfall crash around the pretty facades of 19th-century hotels and restaurants, while fir forests rise on all sides and enfold the whole centre in a symphony of green. Of course, many head here for the fantastic skiing during the winter, while others will come in the footsteps of the Empress Sisi, in search of the bubbling spas and natural springs that first made the Gastein valley a major international destination. "
Salzburg,"No list of Austria’s must-see destinations could possibly be complete without a mention of Salzburg; a melange of magical Baroque and medieval architecture that hits its stride with one chocolate box of a UNESCO-attested Old Town. It was here that Mozart found his romantic muse, here that Julie Andrews yodelled in the valleys; here that the Salzburger bishops raised the mighty Hohensalzburg Castle to command the salt-rich hillsides that roll out towards Bavaria in the distance. But it’s not all history either, because students now party away in Irish pubs along the banks of the Salzach, backpackers sip Stiegl in brewhouses and culture vultures come in their droves for opera, classical concerts and daily renditions of The Sound of Music! "
The Wienerwald,"One of the more off-the-beaten-track destinations to make this list of Austria’s must-sees, the Wienerwald lurks just on the peripheries of Vienna and represents one of the favoured outdoors spots for locals looking to escape the capital for a spell of hiking or biking. In all, the woods of the Wienerwald run for 45 kilometers from the Danube basin, rising in steps and becoming more rugged as they reach the Northern Limestone Alps and Upper Austria. The area is a beautiful patchwork of hornbeams and oaks, fir trees and spruce groves that plays host to wild pigs and oodles of walking trails to boot, not to mention some charming and untrodden villages and towns. "
Baku,"Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, lies along the Caspian Sea, and is a somewhat curious mix of the old walled city of Icheri Seher, and a modern building craze that has led a boom in skyscrapers, many of which are studded with LCD screens. Of all of these, make sure that you don’t miss the Flame Towers, three towers built to resemble fire that cast a bronzed glow over the city at night. The city also embraces the modern at the Museum of the Contemporary Art that has over 900 artworks that feature up and coming artists from the region, and is well worth a visit for those interested in modern culture. You can also try the local produce with a visit to Teze Bazaar, a market famous for its cheeses and spices, or grab a kebab, a local delicacy at one of the numerous open restaurants found all over the city.

The national park has a whole host of local wildlife such as gazelles, birds, jackals, badgers, and Caspian seals. The land here is mostly dry steppe, which lends itself to romantic rolling sand dunes and reed like grass that sways in the wind. The waters here are also known to be crystal clear and teaming with wildlife including the occasional sea snake. If you want to catch sight of the famed Caspian seals, you need to aim to visit from September onwards. "
Mud Volcano,"Many visitors to Azerbaijan may not know that the country has the highest number of mud volcanoes in the world. 350 to be exact! One of the best known is Garasu Volcano, that has been known to spew mud over 1,000 metres into the air. The volcanoes are caused when gases under the earth build up and push the mud high into the air as a release. The first mud volcanoes are said to have erupted in Azerbaijan 25 million years ago, and visitors to Garasu often say that it looks like the surface of the moon! "
Naftalan Oil Resort,"Naftalan resort is famous due to the Naftalan crude oil found here that is said to have healing properties, and has sparked a boom in medical tourism to the region. The resort is located in the Naftalan oil fields in the town of Naftalan, and visitors come here to bathe in the oil or to undergo a range of oil based treatments that are said to help with pain relief and anti-inflammatory healing.

"
Gobustan National Park,"Gobustan is often referred to as the Azerbaijan version of Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, as it features a prehistoric cromlech (a circle of stones that have been positioned vertically). It doesn’t end there however, as Gobustan is an archaeological reserve that lies to the south of Baku and offers a fascinating insight into ancient civilizations due to over 6,000 rock drawings that span over 537 hectares. The findings in Gobustan point to evidence of habitation dating back from the Stone Age, and aside from the cave and rock drawings, there is also evidence of human settlements, and even ancient tombstones. "
Caspian Sea,"Something of a misnomer, the Caspian Sea is actually the largest lake in the world, and measures a whopping 371,000 square kilometres. The Caspian Sea is sits on what looks like an ocean bed, and the water here is indeed salty, although the saline content is lower than that of other seas and oceans, meaning that it is the perfect place for swimming as it is less likely to cause irritation. Popular activities on the Caspian Sea include bot cruises, diving opportunities, and fishing. "
Shirvan National Park,"Shirvan National Park, formally established as a protected area in 2003, used to be located under the Caspian Sea, and now spans over 54,000 hectares to the south of Baku. This protected area is made up largely of semi-desert landscape meaning that you will find ambling sand dunes that are the perfect hideaway for the gazelles found here, and nature lovers may also spot a diverse array of species including turtles, hedgehogs, jungle cats, and jackals. For those more interested in bird life, you will find swans and even flamingos in the park, which tend to congregate around the aptly named Flamingo Lake. Mud volcanoes are also commonly found in the park, the most famous being Bandovan Mountain, which is well worth a visit to take in this amazing natural phenomenon. For those who want to spend time taking in all the natural attractions here, there is accommodation available in the form of quaint bungalows, or, for more adventurous visitors, camping on the northern beach of the park is permitted with a permit "
Nabran,"Nabran is a village that has turned into something of a resort zone in Azerbaijan and is found approximately 3 hours outside of Baku, to the northeast. Nabran lies on the banks of the Caspian Sea, and one of the great attractions here is the climate which provides plenty of sunshine in the summer months. As such, Nabran has a plethora of water based activities that make the most of the ambient weather, including an aqua park and a variety of swimming pools all over the area.

Make sure to check out the beautiful wall paintings and carved windows when you visit. "
Yanar Dag &#8211; Flaming Hillside,"Come to Yanardag to see what are known as burning flame outlets. Yarnadag can be translated as “burning mountain” and the hills here appear to be permanently ablaze due to the gas deposits under the surface of the sandstone found here.  Visitors flock to this impressive natural phenomenon at dusk when the flames are most clearly visible, and the area is also studded with quaint teashops where you can sit in comfort and watch the spectacle as you sip a local beverage. Yanardag is different from the mud volcanoes also found in Azerbaijan as there are no deposits of lava or mud that erupt from the hills, and the region is also one of great religious significance. The fires are said to have inspired fire worship in the Zoroastrianism. "

In the days of old these burning gas outlets were thought to contain evidence of a divine being, and ancient temples were built upon the sites. One of these temples is Ateshgah, located in the suburb of Surakhany in just outside of Baku.  Ateshgah is said to date from the 17th century, and the temple complex is built in the shape of a hexagon. There is a fire alter in the centre, although the natural gases that led to the original construction of the temple have now been exhausted and the fire is produced via a gas pipeline from Baku. "

The water is pumped out of a pipe and can be set alight due to the levels of natural methane contained within, making the oxymoron of flaming water a reality. Locals in Azerbaijan believe that the water here has healing properties and much of it collected as drinking water to cure a whole host of ills. "

Bahrain National Museum,"At first glance Manama might not seem very exciting, and you may write it off as just another gilded metropolis that can be found all across the Middle East. If you explore beneath the shimmering buildings however and the steel-grey skyscrapers that line the Corniche al-Fateh, you will find an exciting Arabic city that has a rich history and engaging culture. Some of the great highlights in Manama can be found in the throbbing souks where you can discover spices, pearls, and exquisite carpets, and you can also take a trip to the Bahrain National Museum to learn all about the Portuguese and Persian past of this city. If you so desire, you can also find swish shopping malls aplenty, as well as luxury resorts that nestle along the Gulf Coast. "
Riffa,"Riffa is located in the heart of Bahrain and it used to be the largest city in the country, before being usurped by its big brother Manama. As a result, this town is full of old world character and you can see ancient sights such as the great Riffa Fort which has amazing crenulated bulwarks and antique court rooms.

These include the enclaves around Tala Island which feature pristine sands and azure lagoons that are perfect if you want to take a dip while enjoying the moneyed surroundings. "
Amwaj Island,"The district of Juffair is sometimes thought of as just another extension of the urban sprawl in Manama, but actually this used to be a completely separate part of Bahrain. One of the main reasons to come here however is to see how rapidly this city is developing as new towers pop up here every year and you will find some top class eateries as well as a wealth of accommodation options. It is also the home of American Alley which, as the name suggests, is an expatriate area of Manama famed for its bars and fast food restaurants. "
Beit Sheikh Ali house,"Muharraq dates from the Dilmun Civilization but it was the Greeks that brought real prosperity to this northern city in Bahrain when they began a series of powerhouse trade routes here. It used to be the capital of Bahrain but nowadays Muharraq is the entry and exit point of Bahrain as it is also the home of Bahrain International Airport. As well as being the main transport hub however, this city also has its own distinct charm. This can be found in the traditional souk area where you will find a wealth of cafes with hookah pipes and mint tea, and this is also a great place to pick up some Middle Eastern trinkets. As an aside, the local football team in Muharraq is reportedly the best in Bahrain. "
Hawar Islands,"The Hawar Islands sit at the southernmost point of the Bahraini archipelago and are just across the coast from neighboring Qatar. These islands are uninhabited, although this is mostly due to the fact that this is one of the most arid parts of Bahrain and as such sourcing water is difficult.

As well as birds, wildlife lovers can also spot the occasional Arabian Oryx. "

Hamad Town,"Some of Bahrain’s cities are ancient wonders, while others are more modern, such as Hamad Town which dates from the 1980s. Located 18 kilometers outside of Manama, it was meant to serve the crowds of commuters working in this already crowded capital city, so with that in mind it is easy to make the trip out here. The town is famous for its wacky roundabouts that dot the horizon as well as the Bahraini Formula One circuit which is located close by. "
Zallaq,Zallaq hugs the western coastline of Bahrain and you will find limpid turquoise lagoons and date palms dotting the shore.

Water sports are popular here including jet skiing and kite surfing and there are barbecue pits all along the beach. 
A’Ali,"Located between Isa Town and the western coast of Bahrain is the lovely little backcountry village of A’Ali. The village is known for being the arts and crafts hub of the region and is particularly famous for its pottery. One of the best things to do here is to wander down to the local bazaar and explore the ceramic shops while watching the locals work on this stunning craft.

"
Qal’at Al Bahrain,"This UNESCO World Heritage Site in Bahrain pokes it head above the dusty desert dunes to the west of Manama. Much of the fortress dates from a 6th century citadel that was used by the Portuguese but some of the larger mounds that have been excavated show that the site was occupied as far back as 2,300 BC. If you are a history buff then this is definitely one place in Bahrain not to miss. "
Al Areen,"The area of Al Areen is covered in hotels and boutique resorts, but accommodation is not the only thing that it has to offer. Instead, it is also known for its wildlife reserve which sprawls over seven square kilometers and is nestled in the southwest of Bahrain. Here you will find a wealth of fauna including Arabian camels, springbok, Nubian gazelles, and Arabian Oryx. There are also Middle Eastern falconry shows held here regularly. "
Saar,"Saar is close to Manama but also far enough away to give off a peaceful and less hectic atmosphere. The area is known for the summer houses of the rich and famous of Bahrain but this is not the only thing of note here. The area is also known for its delicious cafes and coffee houses as well as a host of fine dining options. If you are looking for some historical sites, then you will also find these in Saar in the form of early Dilmun settlements which are famous for their metalwork and copper ore artifacts from millennia gone by. "
"Sitra, Bahrain (Al Bander Hotel)","The island of Sitra sits in the Persian Gulf and is located on the eastern edge of Bahrain. The island is used by oil companies as well as local fisherman, so it is an interesting place to witness two sides of Bahrain working in unison. There are agricultural villages here like Al Kharijiya and Mahazza and you can also use this spot as a stepping stone to the Al Dar archipelago which has palm-fringed beaches and little seaside eateries galore. "
Cox’s Bazar,"Spilling out into the Bay of Bengal is Cox’s Bazar, an area covered in salty fishing skiffs and bustling jetties. This little town in the far south-east of Bangladesh is known for its stunning beach which stretches for an amazing 120 kilometers from north to south along the side of the balmy Indian Ocean. This is the third longest beach on the planet and you will find local fishermen reeling in the day’s catch as well as bubbling rock pools and crashing turquoise waves that make this a great spot for surfing. "
The Sundarbans,"The Sundarbans are located at the point where the mighty waterways of the Brahmaputra and the scared Ganges crash into each other at the edge of the Bay of Bengal. As you would expect, the area is also covered in spectacular wildlife and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here you will find Bengal tigers stalking the mangroves as well as rhesus macaques swinging in the canopies. Other highlights include chitals and you will also find local huts dotted around the area and hiding beneath waxy palm trees. "
Dhaka,"It may seem a world away from the wilds of area like the Sundarbans mangroves but the city of Dhaka offers you a jungle of a different kind. Sprawling along the Buriganga River, Dhaka used to be the home of the British Raj during the colonial period as well as Mughal princes and the likes of Shah Jahan (the architect of the iconic Taj Mahal). Nowadays more than 17 million people call this city home and you can expect temples, churches, mosques monuments, and colorful and aromatic bazaars. Make sure to also check out the curry and golap eateries of Old Dhaka while you are here. "
Srimangal,Srimangal is the tea-growing capital of Bangladesh and the area is a riot of different hues of green. The area is famous for its rains which help the tea to grow and you will find a sea of different plantations here as you explore the highlands and the hamlets that make up Srimangal. On a trip here make sure to visit a local tea processing plant which will usually include a trip to a tasting house so that you can enjoy a cup of fragrant tea whilst enjoying the views over the rippling fields. Hiking is also poplar in the area although the undulating landscapes mean that some hikes are more challenging than others. 
Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard,"Chittagong has a population of 2.5 million which is nothing when you compare it to other cities like Dhaka. That said, this frenetic port town is still worth a visit, particularly if you are traveling to the beautiful Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. These gorgeous trails that include pretty Foy’s Lake are hidden along scenic valleys and Chittagong is widely considered to be the jumping off point if you are planning a trek. In the city proper you will find Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard where you can see hulking tankers being ripped apart, and other spots of interest include the shrine of Sufi Amanat Khan, one of the most revered saints in Bangladesh. "
Rangamati,"Set amongst the beautiful Chittagong Hill Tracts is the delightful mountain town of Rangamati which is a serene and peaceful alternative to many of Bangladesh’s frantic cities. The town sits on the banks of Kaptai Lake which is known for its blue and green waters as well as the woodlands that surround it. Small, colorfully painted boats bob on the surface of the lake and if you are lucky then you may see an Asian elephant strolled along the riverbank. The main draw here is the hiking and wildlife excursions as well as the golden statue of Buddha Dhatu Jadi. Other top spots to visit also include the Parjatan Hanging Bridge and the regal palaces of the old Chakma Raj. "
Bandarban,"Surrounded by the Muranja, Wayla, and Chimbook mountains that rise to nearly 1,000 meters above sea level is the stunning town of Bandaran. The area is covered in misty green and is home to tobacco farms and hilltop lookouts and there is also a lively bazaar where you will find arts and crafts from the Shan tribes from Myanmar across the border. Other reasons to come here include lazy bamboo boat rides along the majestic River Sangu as well as the mighty Nilgiri Hill and the crashing waters of the Jadipai Waterfall. "
Saint Martin,"The little enclave of Saint Martin is like nowhere else in Bangladesh as this is the only coral island in the country. The region is covered in shifting sands and lapping seas, all nestled close to coconut groves. In many ways it looks more like the Caribbean than South Asia, and you will find delicious seafood here including fiery curries. Scuba diving is also a popular pastime, so if you want to check out some of the country’s amazing aquatic life then this is the place to do it. "
Somapura Mahavihara,Paharpur is a pint-sized town which is most well known for the Naogaon District where you will find UNESCO World Heritage Site ruins called Somapura Mahavihara. This spot is said to be one of the most fascinating Buddhist archeological sites in South Asia and takes the form of a large redbrick quadrangle which is bisected with alleys and chambers that would have been meditation rooms in days of old. Make sure to check out the ornate stone work which dates back to the 8th century. 
Kuakata,Kuakata Beach juts out into the Indian Ocean from the southern side of the river islands of central Bangladesh. One of the great reasons to come here is to watch the sunset over the sea with the glowing Sundarbans in the distance. The beach is fringed with tropical palm trees and you will also find small rivers that cut through the land to the Bay of Bengal. This area of Bangladesh is less visited by tourists so if you are looking for the road less traveled then this is a good spot to choose. Some of the people you will see here are the local fisherman and you can sample delicious curried crab and lobster. 
Sylhet,"Located in the lush highlands of the north of the country, Sylhet is covered in tropical forests and tea plantations. This part of Bangladesh has a history that dates back 800 years and you will find Hindu shrines in Jaflong that are slowly being taken over by the lush shrubbery. In the center of Sylhet you will find markets selling piles of tea leaves and locals cycling around town. You will also find the Bangladesh-India border here at Tamabil-Jaflong as well as the Lawacherra Rainforest which is known for its resident leopards. "
Gaur,The ancient city of Gaur sits on the Indian border and is located in north-eastern Bangladesh. Nowadays the city is ruined and uninhabited and you will see red-hued arches as well as towers and crumbling monuments. Power struggles between the Afghans and the Mughals meant that the town was abandoned in the 16th century and you should make sure not to miss the relics here such as the carved stone reliefs in the Eunuchs’ Mosque and the royal tombs. 
Bagerhatb,Bagerhat is not as famous as Dhaka or Srimangal but this peaceful city in the south west of the country has an array of historic attractions that you can enjoy at a slower pace. The city was founded in the 15th century by the Sufi Saint Khan Jahan Ali and it is the home of the Shait Gumbad Mosque. Here you will find towering domes and you can also take a trip to the tomb of Saint Khan Jahan Ali which is usually covered with offerings and surrounded by chanting pilgrims. 
Barisal,"If you were to look at Barisal from above then it would resemble a patchwork of muddy brown and deep green fields. This river town on the Ganges Delta is covered in fields of shrimp farms and rice paddies and if you make it here then be sure to check out the floating markets that sell local vegetables, fruits, and seafood. "
Sonargaon,"Sonargaon used to be a thriving trading hub but now it is something of a ghost town that straddles the Ganges. Here you will find eerie carved mansions and docks, old mosques, and jungle vines twisting in between everything. If you want to see a completely different side of Bangladesh that many people don’t experience, then this is the place to come. "
"Woburn, Bedfordshire","The village of Woburn radiates grandeur in a way that only Georgian architecture can. These flat-fronted townhouses (many a frontage for much older properties) have upscale restaurants, antiques shops and even tailors, in case you weren&#8217;t aware you&#8217;re in a posh part of the county. Woburn Abbey is a former monastery that became the seat of the Duke of Bedford after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, and remains in the family. The art collection is very special, and has 24 Canalettos, 10 van Dycks and a trove of other priceless works. Woburn Safari Park is also on these grounds and will definitely get a thumbs up from kids. "
Bedford,"Bedfordshire&#8217;s county town is unusually diverse despite its modest size. Around a third of Bedford has Italian ancestry and there&#8217;s a large Punjabi community. Bedford also has lots visitors to sink their teeth into, most of all in the central Castle Quarter: This was where the 17th-century preacher and writer John Bunyan was imprisoned for 12 years, during which time he wrote the seminal Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress. The Bunyan Museum is open in summer and will give you all the background. The Higgins Bedford Museum has Saxon and Roman artefacts and watercolours by the likes of J.M.W. Turner. And in such a cosmopolitan location the food is superb; head for Tavistock Street, which is packed with restaurants of all nationalities. "
Leighton Buzzard,"An engaging market town, Leighton Buzzard benefits from being on the Grand Union Canal, which linked Birmingham with London in the 1920s. If you follow it south for a while you&#8217;ll step out into some of Bedfordshire&#8217;s most beautiful countryside, with hedgerows and green fields speckled with sheep. For a dash of splendour you can&#8217;t beat Ascott House, which is in 13 square kilometres of grounds and was developed by Leopold de Rothschild in the Arts and Crafts fashion in the early-1900s. And if you want to teach kids about country ways and let them meet farmyard animals, Mead Open Farm has range of activities like grooming ponies and bottle feeding lambs. "
Dunstable Priory,"In the south of the county, Dunstable has a few things that distinguish it from a typical market town. The showpiece is Dunstable Priory, a Norman wonder dating to 1132 and charged with extra significance because it was here in 1533 that Henry VIII officially divorced Catherine of Aragon, an event with huge repercussions. More modern but no less vital is the new Grove Theatre, a wonderful venue to see touring comedians and musicians. The countryside around the town merits some exploration as you&#8217;re in the eastern foothills of the Chiltern Range. Not to forget Whipsnade Zoo, run by the Zoological Society of London and one of the largest wildlife conservation parks in London. "
Luton,"As a manufacturing town and a transport hub, Luton is never going to be a place for traditional townscapes, pubs and tea rooms. But the town does have some top-notch family, including two free museums. The Stockwood Discovery Centre is a mishmash of exhibits centred on the Bagshawe Gallery, which was inspired by Scandinavian folk museum and captures the trades, costume and way of life in the Luton area in the early-20th century. The Wardown Park Museum, in a handsome &#8220;Jacobethan&#8221; mansion, dips even further into Luton&#8217;s past and recounts its time as one of England&#8217;s lace-making capitals in the 1600s. "
Ampthill,"If you had to create a model for a charming English market town, it would come out looking a lot like Ampthill. Affluent, furnished with lots of Georgian brick architecture and with lots of diverting independent shops, you could pass an enjoyable few hours here. Thursdays particularly because that&#8217;s the market day, and has been since Henry III decreed it in 1242. On a ridge with rousing views are the ghostly ruins of Houghton House, a Jacobean mansion from the 1600s. It was abandoned in the 1700s after its roof collapsed, but loads of detail up to the second floor remains, including window frames, pillars and the vivid white quoins on the corners. "
Biggleswade,"A likeable market town that feels a bit more down to earth than places like Woburn, Biggleswade deserves a visit for some of its noteworthy inhabitants down the years. One of these was Herbert Jordan, the forbear of the well-known company Jordans Cereals, whose Victorian flour mill is both a historical attraction and a sort of community centre, with gardens, a cafe and workshops. Another was Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth a racing driver and aviator, and his fleet of early aircraft is believed to be one of the finest in the world, containing some extremely rare Edwardian flying machines, and also a variety of vintage cars and motorcycles from the first decades of the 20th century. "
Wrest Park &#8211; Silsoe,"A very cute spot to stop by, Silsoe has a pub, a lot of pretty cottages, some minor curiosities and a landmark of immense grandeur. If you amble around the village for a while you&#8217;ll see the 18th-century lock-up, a squat octagonal chamber where drunks would be kept until they sobered up. The Church of St James was rebuilt in the 1820s, and chose a romantic, medieval style some time before this had become fashionable. But the marquee attraction has to be Wrest Park, a Grade I country house with neo-renaissance architecture and absolutely glorious French-style gardens. "
"Moot Hall, Elstow","If you&#8217;ve caught John Bunyan fever in Bedford you could come a short way south to the village of Esltow where he was born in 1628. Since Bunyan was a pious man, the most appropriate sight would be Esltow Abbey, which has been here since the 11th century and became a parish church after the nunnery was suppressed in 1539. Bunyan was baptised here and worshipped at this church as a child. Also check out the Moot Hall on the village green. This lovely timber-framed building was constructed in the late-1400s as a courtroom and meeting hall for the village. "
Shefford,"Set in the remote lush countryside of central Bedfordshire is an unhurried and endearing town that neatly sums up rural England. The main sight is Shefford Porch, a half-timbered house that has survived since the 1200s. But the joys of this place lie mainly in its restaurants, pubs and walking paths that can be joined from the edge of the town. There&#8217;s lovely scenery all around, irrigated by the Flit and Hit Rivers, and three golf courses within moments of the town. "
Minsk,"The capital city of Belarus has a lot to offer visitors. Head to Independence Square which at 7 hectares is one of the largest public squares in all of Europe, and is perfect for an evening stroll to take in the pretty water fountains and dancing lights. Also not to be missed is Independence Avenue that acts as the main artery of the city, and has cafes, restaurants, and shopping opportunitiess, as well as clubs and music events.

The castle is known for being trapezium in shape, as well as for its crimson walls that are the result of the ornate brickwork.

Bruges,"Catapulted to fame by the 2008 hit film In Bruges, this pop-up cut-out of a medieval town in the heartlands of Flemish Belgium rarely fails to impress. Its old centre is an enchanting labyrinth of winding stony streets, each fringed with the rising apses of Low Country townhouses.

"Korenmarkt, Ghent","It’s just a matter of time before Ghent begins to vie against Antwerp and Brussels for the top spot on lists of Belgium’s must-see metropolitan destinations. Once one of the most powerful city states in Europe, it opted to take something of a backseat in the modern age; preferring to hide its gorgeous location on the confluence of the Scheldt and Leie and that chocolate box old town area (the largest pedestrianised urban zone in the country). Today, travelers head in to explore the postcard-perfect rows of Flemish townhouses that line the Graslei docks, or delve into the Gothic medley that rises with the bulwarks of the Gravensteen castle. Others sip Belgian brews in the riverside pubs, or devour platters of moules frites amidst the tight-knit alleyways.

Durbuy,"Nestled deep in a wooded valley in the midst of the Wallonia Ardennes, Durbuy enchants visitors with a rustic web of winding cobblestone lanes and bucolic cottages dressed in rhododendron, ivy vines and poppy blooms. A clutch of hearty and welcoming Belgian beer joints rubs shoulders with accomplished fine-dining restaurants between the streets of the medieval centre, while narrow lanes like Rue des Récollets are a real treat for strollers. Summertime brings booming crowds to the craft boutiques of the self-proclaimed ‘smallest town in the world’, while winter gives a wilder hue to the riparian setting in the middle of pretty Luxembourg province. "
Antwerp,"Cool, confident and classically subversive, Antwerp has really honed its rep as the second city of Belgium. A booming diamond trading centre and moneyed to the hilt, the town touts grandiose Flemish houses, winding medieval streets overshadowed by the looming Gothicism of the city Cathedral, the glorious old home of Rubens, and an endearingly gaudy Red Light district where Toots Thielemans tunes echo past candlelit beer bars. And then – of course – there’s the Het Zuid neighbourhood; Antwerp’s sleepless modern edge, where bohemian coffee shops rub shoulders with antique emporiums, fixie riders glide past graffiti artists and the acclaimed MUHKA art gallery offers cutting-edge avant-garde. See our post on the <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-antwerp/"">best things to do in Antwerp</a> to learn more! "
"Ypres, Belgium","Etched into the minds of many as the site of one of the most bloody and destructive battles of the First World War, little Ypres in the midst of the Westhoek is a real must for any history buffs making their way through Belgium. From 1914 onwards, the rolling fields around this ancient city were dug-out by French, Canadian, British, ANZAC and other allied troops as they vied for control of West Flanders and attempted to push German lines back over the infamous Passendale Ridge. Today, this bloody struggle is commemorated by the Menin Gate Memorial and the In Flanders Fields Museum, which has been hailed as the most comprehensive World War I exhibit in all of Europe. "
Hoge Kempen,"Belgium’s solitary National Park is a real patchwork of natural beauty that does well to sum up the wild hinterland of Eastern Flanders. Covering 60 square kilometers of the picturesque Limburg region, the park is home to rolling heath and undulating hills, misty pine forests and mirror-like lakes, all dotted with packs of wild deer and sweeping blooms of lavender and thistle. With a whopping total of more than 200 kilometers of winding hiking trails and countless bridal paths and biking tracks besides, it’s hardly surprising that this one’s now a real favourite amongst outdoorsy types making their way through the Low Countries. "
Leuven,"Touting its 800-year-old university, a booming student population of more than 25,000 beer-loving erudite Belgians and the famous Grand Béguinage district (a UNESCO-attested area of cobbled streets, enchanting red-brick buildings and pretty Flemish facades), it’s hardly a surprise that Leuven is on the up. Yes sir, travelers are now more eager than ever to delve into the elegant streets that weave around the Grote Markt below the filigreed Gothic spires of one eye-watering City Hall, while others will come just for the beer – this is the home of the sprawling InBev brewery (one of the largest of its kind in the world), along with countless specialist craft bars touting ancient Trappist ales and Belgian abbey beers to boot!

Brussels,"No list of Belgium’s top must-see sights could possibly be complete without at least a mention of its sprawling, action-packed and indelibly exciting capital city.

"
Mons,"Proud former European Capital of Culture and the home of perhaps the most elegant historic centre in all of Belgium, Mons and its array of Luxembourgish-come-Germanic townhouses sits draped over the southwestern hillsides just a stone’s throw from the border with France. The action focusses on the irresistible Grand Place square, where the elaborate facades of one seriously photogenic town hall sit in the shadow of Belgium’s only Baroque belfry (a UNESCO World Heritage Site to boot).     The town is also home to the erstwhile house of the totemic Dutch post-impressionist Vincent Van Gogh, while the famous Ducasse festivities in the spring make for a striking display of local religious traditions, complete with biblical re-enactments, pitched battles between St George and the dragon, horse parades and more. "
Spa,"Responsible for adding the prefix ‘spa’ to destinations famed for their bubbling mineral springs right across the globe, this charming little town in the heart of Liege province comes complete with row upon row of regal facades and La Belle Époque architectural pieces. It has been hailed for its healing waters since way back in the 14th century, and today folk still flock to the all-new Thermes baths that look over the downtown streets where once Dumas and Victor Hugo and the fictional Hercule Poirot would have flitted between Parisian-style cafes and babbling fountains. Nice. "
Namur,"A patchwork of traditional Mosan-style homes built from grey brick and stoic black slate, crisscrossing cobblestone lanes and pretty riverside promenades, Namur belies its official status as a regional capital with a laid-back, historic vibe. Its undisputed piece de resistance is the sprawling medieval Citadelle that crowns the hillsides above the Sambre. More than 1,000 years old, it remains one of the largest fortresses in all of Europe and comes complete with oodles of escape tunnels and bulwarks that were used right up until WWII. And once travelers are done touring the castle complex on the hill, Namur’s cobbled Place du Vieux Marché beckons; a pretty European square that’s awash with al fresco cafes and Belgian beer bars aplenty. "
Liege,"Straddling the Meuse River as it meanders northwards through the grassy valleys and woods of Wallonia, Liege is one of the less-trodden cities in Belgium. However, travelers who linger here just a little before heading out to explore the wilds of the Ardennes are in for a real treat. For one there’s a seriously pretty medieval old town area that cascades down from the fascinating Citadel of Liege to the riverbanks, encompassing the flying buttresses of a reconstructed city cathedral, acclaimed institutions like Musée des Beaux-Arts and the eclectic Egyptology-come-Bonapartist collections of the Curtius Museum as it goes. And then there’s the nightlife – a medley of student-led jazz bars and Low Country pubs that bustles between the Victorian and Art Deco homes of the Le Carré neighbourhood. Learn more about Liege: <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-liege-belgium/"">best things to do in Liege</a>. "
The Ardennes,"A sprawling section of southern Belgium that’s famed as one of the most beautiful hiking destinations in all of Northern Europe, the Ardennes ranges from the city of Namur, across the valleys of the meandering Meuse River and down to the wild plateau Fens on the edge of the German Eifel Mountains. Between its borders travelers can seek out rock-clad castles like Chateau de Bouillon, Mardi Gras festivities in Malmedy, beautiful canoeing waters along the River Lesse, stalactite-dotted caves and grottoes amidst the Ourthe hills, dense woodlands and Trappist monasteries in Rochefort, rugged cliffs in Dinant, verdant valleys that give way to winding river channels, misty forests that go on for miles and oodles, oodles more! "
Ostend,"Escape the inland cities and towns of Belgium for a blast of North Sea air along the sun-splashed (at least by summer!) esplanades of Ostend, which runs its way along the windswept coastline of West-Flanders just a short ride out of Bruges. Much-loved by locals for its buzzing atmosphere and sandy beaches between June and August, it’s actually surprisingly easy to fall in love with this one’s cookie cutter seaside hotels, curiously English tearooms and hedonistic clubs along Langestraat. There’s history to explore too, most notably at the infamous Atlantic Wall Open Air Museum, which chronicles German fortification of the European seaboard, while aquariums and various marine-themed expos relate the town’s indelible connection to the North Sea. "
Bastogne Monument,"Perched right on the borderlands with Luxembourg to the south, the now sleepy, 15,000-strong town of Bastogne boasts a history going all the way back to the centuries when Gallic tribes waged war with Roman centurions in the Low Countries. However, the spot is now better known for its place at the heart of the tumultuous and dark histories of the 20th century. In 1944 it was from here that German divisions planned the Battle of the Bulge, and the town subsequently played host to the heroic 101st Airborne Division as they were encircled by Axis troops. Today, this pivotal moment of the Western Front is commemorated at the acclaimed Bastogne War Museum, the colossal Mardasson Memorial and the Bastogne Barracks alike. "
Cotonou,"It may not be the true capital city of Benin but Cotonou sure does feel like it. The city is an intense blast of urban energy combined with African charm. If it is your first time in Africa, the city can be a little bit daunting and full on but for those willing to risk the adventure, Cotonou has plenty of rewards These rewards include a number of stunning paradise beaches with golden sand and palm trees.The Pendjari National Park is also a must see in Cotonou and is seen as one of the leading animal reserves in Africa. For those looking for a more obscure attraction, the &#8220;Fetish Market&#8221; sells a large variety of dead animals for voodoo festival celebrations. "
Petrol being sold in the streets of Ouidah,"Ouidah is a city that has a mix of influence from the French and the Portuguese due to various events in history. The city is located about 40km away from Cotonou and in contrast is more relaxed. If you are interested in African history (and you should be) then this city should be top of your itinerary. It has fantastic museums exploring slavery and voodoo. If all the history gets too much for you, there are more stunning beaches to laze on in Ouidah too. "
"Porto Novo, Benin","Porto Novo is the capital city of Benin and former French capital of Dahomey. If you have visited Cotonou first, you will probably struggle to understand why Porto Novo is the official capital city, the population is only around 250,000 and the pace is much more leisurely than Cotono. The influence of the Portugeuse in this area are still clear to see in the present day. Sights in the city include the Royal Palace and gardens as well as the museum of Porto Novo kings. "
"Voodoo market near Abomey, Benin","Abomey was the capital of Ancient Dahomey for around 300 years starting in the 17th Century. The main attraction and reason for visiting the city is the Unesco World Heritage Site of the Abomey Royal Palaces. Although the palaces have largely been destroyed and are in a ruinous state, the site still has enormous historical value and the tales of kings that once resided here are fascinating. "
Grand-Popo,The town of Grand-Popo has an intriguing history mainly due to the important role it played in the slave trade. The town oozes with African charm and the people are friendly. The town is about an hours drive from Cotonou and offers a perfect change of pace from the busy city. There are many backside hotels and resorts in the town and the beaches are a great place to relax and swim. The nearby Mono River is a great place to walk and offers a chance to see mangroves and exotic bird life. 
Natitingou,"Located a convenient 50km away from the Pendjari National Park, the city of Natitingou also has some of its own attractions that make it a worth stop off on a tour of Benin. The city has its own museum which is based in a French colonel building and documents the lifestyle of the Somba people. In fact the city of Natitingou is one of the best places to see the Somba people&#8217;s way of life and methods of building. Natitingou is also a great place to see Shea butter being made. "
Bohicon,"Bohicon is more of a place to pass through than to actually spend an extended period of time visiting. The town is an almost entirely modern place but it is well worth visiting the market, which is arguably the biggest and the best in Benin. The difference between the bustling market and the relative calm of nearby Abomey is startling. The busiest times for the market are in the mornings, so these should be avoided if possible (unless of course you thrive on the chaos). "
Tanguieta,"This charming town is a great place to see colonial French buildings in Benin. The population of the town is small: only about 20,000 people call Tanguieta their home. Tanguieta also has a lively market, although it is nowhere near as lively as Bohicon&#8217;s, and is a great place from which to visit the Tonogou Waterfalls or the Pendjari National Park which is home to some of the most majestic beats in Africa including lions, hyenas and elephants to name only a few. "
Parakou,"The second largest city in Benin, Parakou has an estimated population of 200,000 people. Despite its size, the city does not feel as lively and crowded as Porto Novo or Cotonou due to more open spaces and wider streets. The city is industrious with most of its economy focusing on cotton, textiles and peanut oil. There are a number of worthwhile things to see in Parakou including the open-air museum which shows traditional Bariba architecture and the market specialising in a traditional kind of beer. "
Lake Nokoue,"This lake and small village is a great place for birdwatching. The species that call this 16,000 hectare lake there home include the African Openbill and the white crested heron. The lake is under threat from several environmental and biological issues such as logging, pollution and hunting of the wildlife. Conservation efforts are being made but the threat level is classified as high, so view this amazing area while you still can. "
Tchaourou,"Located roughly 60km to the south of Parkou, Tchaourou is primarily an agricultural town but is also know for its involvement with Nigeria in fuel trafficking. The main sights in the town are the market, that takes place each Monday, as well as the hard to miss house&#8217;s of Benin president Yayi Boni which are both lavish and out of place but worth a look nonetheless. The nearby cashew factory also offers guided tours for a low price (sometimes free) but no photographs are allowed. "
Nikki,"The capital of historical Bariba, Nikki is also home to an ancient palace that still controls a large area including some of Nigeria. Nikki is relatively tourist free which makes it a great place to see Benin in all of its unspoiled glory. Again, the market here is well worth visiting as well as the town center which has interesting shops and places to eat. The main sight however is of course the Royal Palace and the museum of the Royal Palace which is ever improving and expanding. "
Pehunco,"Pehunco is another great place to escape from the well trodden tourist track (if there is a well trodden track in Benin). The town of Pehunc is known for its jewelery so the markets here are extra special. Throughout the year ceremonies take place in Pehunco featuring the regional king&#8217;s horse. There are not many sights as such in Pehunco, it is just a normal Benin village and this is the main reason for visiting. A stop off in Pehunco is a great lesson and insight into the village life of the people of Benin. "
"Boukoumbé, Benin","Another town with an impressive market, Boukoumbe is located about 40km west of Natitingou. The town is a great base for visits to the highest point of Benin; Mount Koussou-Kovangou. Boukoumbe has its own attraction however, the tata sombas, traditional two-story castle like buildings that were originally built and inhabited by the Dita Mari people. The ground floor of the houses were used to hold livestock and the upper level was used by the families residing there. The town has a &#8220;tats touristique&#8221; which is an example of the buildings for tourists which is reached via a guided hike or moped. Sleeping on the tata somba&#8217;s roof is also possible. "
Malanville,"Not the easiest part of Benin to get to but worth a look nonetheless, Malanville is about 35km away from Karimama via a rough and ready dirt track. The best way to undertake the journey is probably a taxi as it is quite an adventure. The market is the main attraction of the town although some locals would argue that the chicken and chips served by the Niger River Bridge is also worth a mention. Malanville is another example of a village that is a good place to visit if you are hoping to avoid the tourist beaten track. "
Windsor,"Two of the most visited attractions in the country are in this regal town on the Thames. Windsor Castle hardly needs introduction: Since the reign of Henry I in the early 12th century this has been residence for the royal family, which makes it the oldest occupied royal palace in Europe. You could easily get lost in the 5,000-hectare Great Park, while you can spend a few hours idling around the town, seeing sights like Christopher Wren&#8217;s 17th-century Guildhall. And then for little guys there&#8217;s LEGOLAND Windsor, which in 2016 became the UK&#8217;s favourite theme park and promises a day of LEGO-themed amusements and rides for kids up to 12. "
Donnington Castle,"A well-preserved historic town, the centre of Newbury makes for an agreeable walk, and the grassy tow paths on the Kennet and Avon Canal are wonderfully serene . Newbury Racecourse hosts the Lockinge Stakes in May, one of the most valuable races on the calendar. The stately home, Highclere Castle is majestic, and is in a sweeping 2,000-hectare estate. It needs to be part of your plans if you&#8217;re a fan of Downton Abbey, as one glance will tell you that this was where the TV show was filmed. The house is newer than it looks, from the 1800s, and has a &#8220;Jacobethan&#8221; design inspired by the 16th and 17th-century palaces. Ramble on the downs in the surrounding country parks, and get to Donnington Castle, where an 18-month siege took place in the English Civil War. "
The Waterside Inn,"Without knowing about its culinary pedigree, Bray would seem like any other well-to-do and charming village in the South of England. There are almshouses from the early 1600s and the handsome Church of St Michael, which was constructed in the 1290s and has a lot of riveting medieval artefacts within, including a monumental brass on the tomb of Sir John Foxley. But Bray&#8217;s modern reputation comes from its restaurants, as two of the four three Michelin-starred establishments are in the this village. The older of the two is the Waterside Inn, founded by the Roux brothers in 1972, while Heston Blumenthal&#8217;s Fat Duck has won acclaim for its molecular gastronomy since opening in 1995. "
"Reading, England","Although it doesn&#8217;t get a lot of credit for its looks, Reading is a large and thriving urban centre with a high-ranking university and all the shopping you can handle. Being close to London it became a manufacturing town in the 1800s and was endowed with perfect transport links, where the Kennet and Avon Canal joins the Thames. You&#8217;re also just a couple of miles east of the North Wessex Downs, with their lush green hills and crystal-clear chalk streams should you crave the countryside. In the town, poke around the ruins of Reading Abbey and drop by at attractions like the Museum of Zoology, Museum of Berkshire Aviation and the Museum of English Rural Life. "
Wokingham,"In Tudor times Wokingham was a centre for silk spinning, and small hints of this industry remain. Have a stroll along Rose Street, where the half-timbered houses with taller bottom floors would have contained looms. The Victorian Gothic revival town hall in the middle of Market Place is still at the heart of the community, with a stylish cafe in its courtyard, and the historic buildings around it house a mix of locally-owned shops and high street brands. There are a few walks you can begin right in the town, like the path up to Fichampstead Ridges, clad with woodland and heather. "
Hungerford,"Close to Wiltshire in the North Wessex Downs, Hungerford is a little way from Walbury Hill, which at almost 300 metres is the highest point in the Southeast. The Kennet and Avon Canal curves past the northern side of the town and in the 19th century transported coal and stone quarried from Somerset up towards Reading on the Thames. Hungerford Wharf is achingly pretty and a wonderful place to see the narrowboats gliding up and down the canal on a sunny day. Cross the bridge in the town for a taste of southern rural England on the high street, with lots of 17th and 18th century properties, including the Hungerford Arcade, an antiques centre with more than 100 dealers under one roof. "
Eton Riverside,"Opposite Windsor on the north bank of the Thames is the town of Eton, synonymous with Eton College. This is the most famous and prestigious of all of England&#8217;s Public Schools, founded by Henry VI and with 19 former British Prime Ministers among its alumni. If you&#8217;re in any doubt about how posh this place is the school has its own Natural History Museum, open on Sundays, but you can arrange a visit at other times. Eton&#8217;s high street has rows of historic brick and half-timbered buildings housing upmarket shops like a delicatessen and antique bookshops, and to stretch your legs there&#8217;s lovely green space at the Brocas and South Meadow next to the Thames. "
Pangbourne,"Anybody who recalls the children&#8217;s book the &#8220;Wind in the Willows&#8221; will be interested to learn that its author Kenneth Grahame retired in Pangbourne in the 1920s. The village is full of handsome old houses with one-off shops, and made all the more picturesque by the Thames. On the banks are large green water meadows owned by Pangbourne and where the village fete takes place every June. For the rest of the summer they&#8217;re a dreamy spot for a picnic in the shade of the willow trees. If you&#8217;re travelling with little ones they&#8217;ll have a fun time at Beale Park, a gentle attraction with farm animals and more exotic species like meerkats, lemurs and mongooses. "
Ascot Racecourse,"The three villages that make up the town of Ascot are very well-heeled and are mostly geared towards Ascot Racecourse, which is surely the most prestigious in the country. So for visitors who show up for the 26 days of racing each year in need of accommodation there are plenty of hotels and restaurants. The course has close links to the royal family, having been established by Queen Anne in 1711 and  is situated just a few miles from Windsor. Royal Ascot Week in June remains wildly popular, packing in 300,000 spectators and attended without fail by Queen Elizabeth. Since the 18th century this event has been a mainstay of the &#8220;London Season&#8221; for the country&#8217;s social elite. "
"St Mary&#8217;s, Streatley","At an ancient crossing on the Thames, Streatley is a stunning village right next to the larger town of Goring, across the county line in South Oxfordshire. The landscape is one of steep wooded hills that are outcrops of the Chiltern Range on the eastern cusp of the North Wessex downs. A lot of the surrounding countryside is owned by the National Trust so you&#8217;re free to walk up and admire of the views of the river and village, while Ridgeway National Trail crosses the Thames at Goring and Streatley on its way east. In this very upmarket spot you have a fine selection of pubs and restaurants, and there&#8217;s also a golf club open to visitors and running since 1895. "
Maidenhead,"The large town of Maidenhead is just across the river from  Buckinghamshire, and links to the neighbouring village of Taplow via the Maidenhead Bridge. This structure gives us one of the loveliest sights in the town, and was built in the 1770s with seven arches and wrought iron lanterns. You could walk a small stretch of the Thames Path up to Boulter&#8217;s Lock, which is also from the 1700s and is a wonderful spot to sit and ponder the river and its weir, or watch the barges go by. And between Boulter&#8217;s Lock and Bray Lock is the Maidenhead Railway Bridge, designed by the revered Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1839. The Maidenhead Heritage Centre can clue you in on the town&#8217;s connection to the Air Transport Auxiliary, which was based near the town in the Second World War and helped move vital RAF machinery around the country. "
Cookham,"One of Britain&#8217;s most acclaimed 20th-century painters, Stanley Spencer was born in this Thameside village where he also spent a great deal of his life. Now in the Wesleyan Chapel that he attended when he was growing up there&#8217;s a museum with more than 100 of Spencer&#8217;s paintings and drawings. Give yourself time to see a bit more of the village and its common, where there a blend of timber-framed houses and adorable cottages with flint walls. You&#8217;ll be looking at some of the most expensive property per square-metre in England, in what is often described as the richest village in the country. "
Kintbury,"In the green rolling hills of the North Wessex Downs, the small waterside village of Kintbury polls among the best villages in the country. You won&#8217;t be blown away by any amazing sights, but can see rural England at its primmest in one of the most coveted addresses around. On the high street the older part of the village looks much as it did a century ago, with delightful brick cottages and a rustic medieval church. Stop at the 18th-century Dundas Arms next to the Kennet and Avon Canal for a pub lunch with a gentrified twist. "
Sulhamstead &#8211; St Mary&#8217;s Church,"Another understated pick for an excursion, Sulhamstead does have one high-profile visitor attraction in the Thames Valley Police Museum. You can just show up on a Wednesday, and on other days of the week you&#8217;ll need to phone ahead. But if you&#8217;re fascinated by one of 20th century Britain&#8217;s most notorious heist&#8217;s, this museum in a beautiful neoclassical mansion has artefacts relating to the Great Train Robbery in 1963. On the Kennet and Avon Canal is the endearing Tyle Mill, which was originally for flour and later became a sawmill, loading and shipping timber with the help of the wharf. "
"Slough, England","Just up from Eton and Windsor, this workmanlike town doesn&#8217;t have the same reputation for history and architecture; rather it&#8217;s a place of business and industry that complements the more genteel places nearby. The bricks for Eton College were baked in Slough, and the Industrial Estate remains a hive of activity and a base for international companies like LEGO and McAfee. People head to the centre for the Observatory Shopping Mall, which has 120 stores, and Slough is right by the Colne Valley Regional Park, a large, mostly undeveloped space that acts as a green buffer around the M25. "
Tiger&#8217;s Nest of the Paro Valley.,"Cut straight into the vertical rises of the Bhutanese mountains just north out of the charming town of Paro, the breathtaking rooms of the Taktsang monastery are perhaps the most-photographed and legendary in the entire Himalayas. First constructed in the late 17th century, the site marks the fabled spot where Guru Padmasambhava is said to have meditated for three whole years. Today, the revered Guru is hailed as Bhutan&#8217;s patron, and the figure who brought Buddhism to the nation. Visitors come and explore this fascinating story between the precariously-perched cloisters and golden-topped prayer rooms of Taktsang: the awesome so-called Tiger&#8217;s Nest of the Paro Valley. "
Rinpung Dzong,"Paro sits nestled in the heart of a wide valley at the western end of the Bhutanese Himalaya. A handsome place whose paved roads and neatly-painted, half-timbered cottages belie its modern construction (Paro was largely rebuilt in the 1980s, with all the work adhering to the traditional architecture of the region), it&#8217;s home to the whitewashed rises of the great Rinpung Dzong. Part monastery, part fortress, this great citadel of timber-topped walls is one of the finest examples of military-religious architecture in the country. Above it is where travelers will find the National Museum of Bhutan, hidden in an old watchtower on a hill. "
Trongsa Dzong,"When it comes to Bhutan&#8217;s whitewashed dzong complexes, there are few that can live up to the sheer size and breathtaking beauty of the Trongsa Dzong. Yep, this colossal medley of half-timbered halls and high-perched prayer rooms makes its home on a craggy outcrop above the Mangde River. It was once the ancestral seat of the Wangchuck dynasty, who are now the royal family of Bhutan. And while the mechanics of state have largely moved to Thimphu, this great palace still holds great political and religious importance, and displays a mosaic of gorgeous 15th and 16th-century architecture typical of the region. "
Changangkha Lhakhang,"Straddling the meanders of the Raidak River in its own little crack in the middle of the western Bhutanese Himalaya, Timphu is a curios place. With its ancient temples and monastery complexes it oozes with age-old Buddhist charm, while the recent arrival of motorized traffic and modern business gives it the energy and flair of a new capital. Landmarks abound too, from the 15th-century Changangkha Lhakhang to the grand bronze effigy of Sakyamuni Buddha with its views over the mountains. Also, don’t miss the colossal Trashi Chhoe Dzong, which is now the home of Bhutan&#8217;s government. "
Bumthang District,"Small and sleepy Jakar sits in the midst of the impossibly-beautiful Choekor Valley – an area hailed as Little Switzerland for its sweeping vistas of fir forests and alpine hills. A religious center, and the gateway to the eastern beauties of the Bumthang District, it&#8217;s peppered with gorgeous whitewashed monasteries. Atop the town, the great Jakar Dzong keeps watch, representing one of the largest fortified monasteries in the country, while sites like the Kurje Lhakhang below tell stories of the 8th-century Indian master Guru Rinpoche, who helped bring Buddhism to this far-flung corner of the mountains all those centuries ago. "
the Palace of Great Happiness,"Encompassed by sweeping valleys of rice paddy and agricultural terraces, the onetime capital of Punakha is around three hours by car from Thimphu. Every traveler who makes it here, deep in the heart of the Himalayan range, will instantly be drawn to the huge complex of the Palace of Great Happiness. This is one of the most iconic buildings in all of Bhutan, and the winter residence of their national Buddhist order. Surrounding this are clutches of traditional farmer hamlets, like the enchanting adobe town of Ritsha, which ooze rustic character and come dotted with earthy teahouses touting curries. "
Gangteng Monastery,"The great Gangteng Monastery emerges from the cascading fir and spruce forests of the Wangdue Phodrang District in central Bhutan. It&#8217;s unquestionably one of the most revered religious sites here, known for its veneration of the terchen king Pema Lingpa – one of the country&#8217;s great spiritual patrons. Located on a high bluff of stone that pokes up above the town of the same name (Gangteng Village) the great monastery is a real wonder to behold. Check out the carved timber frontispieces and the glowering garuda gargoyles, all before hitting the famous trekking trails of the greater Phubjika Valley – the stomping ground of the rare black crane. "
Trashigang,"The oriental end of the high-perched Lateral Road that runs right through the heart of Bhutan, Trashigang can be found sat up on the peaks above the meanders of the Drangme Chhu River. Perhaps the most important town in the eastern districts of the country, it&#8217;s topped by its very own breathtaking dzong: a medley of gilded roofs and whitewashed walls that sits high above the forest canopies and over the alpine valley bottoms below. In the center itself, visitors will discover an earthy folk bazaar, where all the stalls and sellers crowd around an elaborate public prayer wheel. "
Bumthang,"Known to locals by its official name – the Chokhor Valley – the word Bumthang (which actually refers to the whole of central Bhutan) has become the de facto moniker of this stretch of mountains in the northern reaches of the country. Home to a series of truly impressive monasteries, it&#8217;s actually one of the top destinations to come and witness traditional dzong architecture. You can start with a trip to the mighty walls of Jakar Dzong, before casing out the nearby monastery of Tamshing Goemba. Then, there are more mysterious religious sites in Shinyer Village, not to mention the traditional arts and crafts center of Chhumey – the place to buy Himalayan wool! "
Indian border gate,"Sat right on the edge of the mountains, where the great phalanx of Himalayan peaks begins to rise against the Indian border, thriving little Phuentsholing is one of the most up-and-coming cities in Bhutan. Made rich thanks to its ease-of-access and close connections to the town of Jaigaon in West Bengal, it&#8217;s a center for trade and selling. Markets pepper its middle, while there&#8217;s a distinctly built-up character to the looks of the place – you&#8217;re not likely to see so many concrete structures and paved roads anywhere else in the country! Phuentsholing is also a great place to see the Indian border gate, and the relaxed patrols that are common there. "
Wangduephodrang,"Another breathtaking mountain town shrouded by the chiseled peaks of the Himalaya, another mighty dzong fortress from the 17th century. Yep, Wangduephodrang has its own monastery-citadel complex, which can be found glowering down on the small town from its misty shelf in the middle of the peaks. Unfortunately, the whole structure suffered immensely after a destructive fire in 2012. Reconstruction projects on the site are still underway, although it remains a great stopover on the Lateral Road between the Phobjikha Valley and Bumthang. "
Mongar,"One of the favored stepping stones in the east on the way to the provincial hub of Trashigang, Mongar occupies its own hilltop on the plateau of the Bhutanese Himalaya. Visitors enjoy eye-wateringly wonderful views from the get-go, with sweeping valleys and wide mountain massifs dressed in fir unfolding on all sides. Add to that Mongar&#8217;s reputation as an educational center, and its lively daily marketplace, which bursts with woven goods and organic lemon oils, and it&#8217;s easy to see why so many folks opt to linger a while. "
Lhuntse,"Lhuntse (or Lhuntshi as it&#8217;s also known) is another jewel of eastern Bhutan. Hidden in a steep-sided valley of verdant green woods and mist-clad summits, its setting is pure drama. And then there&#8217;s the pint-sized dzong at its center, which rises on an escarpment of wooded rock like some mighty palace out of Game of Thrones. However, that half-timbered citadel is just a part of the attraction, because Lhuntse is also known for its accomplished local wool products, and as a fine jumping off point for the trekking trails that weave through the mountains to the villages of Gangzur and Khoma – both pictures of rustic Bhutanese life. "
Kilung Lhakhang,"Tiny little Kilung Lhakhang is just a speck on the map. Sat nestled between the verdant Himalaya close to aforementioned Lhuntse, it&#8217;s an off-the-beaten-track place to say the least. However, there&#8217;s a deep and fascinating history to learn about here, with a revered chain mall relic that is said to have performed miracles. The very location is also worth seeing, with the town spilling over the ridges in a medley of old Tshanglas homes and tin-roofed concrete builds. In all, it&#8217;s a fascinating picture of backcountry Bhutan! "
Tang,"Tang is the hardest-to-get-to section of the aforementioned Bumthang Valley; a place of beautiful greenery and fir-peppered hillsides, where a smattering of awesome Buddhist relics continues to magnetize monks and intrepid travelers alike. The Mebar Tsho (or the so-called Burning Lake) is one of the great treats here, being a location associated with the miracles of Pema Lingpa back in the 14th century. The museum at Ogyen Choling is also worth a visit, where there are collections of local crafts and preserved living quarters of age-old Buddhist monks to help unravel the deep connections between this nation and its religious faith. "
Lake Titicaca,"With one leg in Peru and one leg in Bolivia, it’s easy to see how this vast water body hails in as the largest lake in South America. Just think: Titicaca is the pool formed from 27 separate rivers, roaring down from the glaciers of the Andes and into the flatlands of the Altiplano. Islands pepper its cobalt-blue surface on both sides of the border; Bolivia claiming the enthralling Isla del Sol (named for being the revered birthplace of the sun in pre-Columbian belief), where ancient remnants like the Pilco Kaima and Kasa Pata mix with carved terraces of hardy grain, leather-faced locals and squawking llamas. Then there’s Suriki, the home of the iconic reed boat peoples. Lake Titicaca’s simply not to be missed! "
"Train Graveyard, Uyuni","Wrap up warm for a trip to far-flung Uyuni; the last bastion of Bolivian civilisation before the vast rolling swathes of the southern salt flats. Yes sir, with average lows peaking at just one degree here, there’s a reason chattering teeth and howling wind chills are the backing track. However, undeterred by the climate of this remote 19th century trading post come tourist town, visitors still arrive in their droves, spurred on by the promise of touring the great white expanse that is the Salar de Uyuni (the largest slat pan on the planet!). Here, Andean flamingos pepper the crusty grounds and Incahuasi Island rises in a mass of crooked cacti and crags – it really is an otherworldly sight to behold! "
"La Paz, Bolivia","Nuestra Senora de La Paz is now the buzzing political and economic hub of Bolivia as a whole. After the decline of silver-rich Potosi in the south, this city grew and grew, booming with an influx of Altiplano peoples and revolutionaries eager to push through the proclamations of one Pedro Domingo Murillo (the city’s own son and now remembered in La Paz with parades and street names alike). Today, that city has sprawled and crawled outwards into the Cordillera Real, cascading down the Andean ridges in barrios and ramshackle neighbourhoods. The center still retains traces of colonial beauty on Plaza Murillo and Calle Jaen, while markets erupt on Sagarnaga Street and the Teleferico cable car showcases the altitudinous wonders of this 4,100-meter-high capital! "
Santa Cruz,"Spread-eagle on the tropical reaches of the Andean range (which can sometimes just be spotted silhouetted on the horizon out of Santa Cruz), the sprawling capital of the Bolivian east is forever encroaching and growing, poking its urban tendrils into the jungled backcountry that encompasses it. Peppering the heart of the metropolis are elegant reminders of its Spanish roots: the Catedral de Santa Cruz and the beautifully carved frontispieces of the Iglesias de la Chiquitania to name just two. Meanwhile, the Avenida Monsenor Rivero pulses with hearty Bolivian bean stews and Irish pubs alike. And then there’s the backcountry delights too, ranging from the wilds of Amboro to the cataracts of Jardin De Las Delicas. Nice. "
"Coroico, Bolivia","Strapped to the hillsides of the verdant Cordillera Real, on the sheer-cut and meandering roadways of the Yungas, Coroico rises like a bloom of terracotta and stone above the deep-green shades of the cloud forests and jungle that surround it. Indelibly beautiful and with a reputation for laid-back Bolivian living, the town draws travelers with its magnificent panoramas of the Andes: valleys of rolling coffee farms and lemon woods, river-carved gorges and even snow-mantled mountaintops on the horizon. A yearly festival is the only thing that breaks the slow pace, while siestas, casual woodland strolls, birdwatching and coffee drinking are the main attractions most other days! "
"Samaipata, Bolivia","Row upon row of red-tiled roofs line up in pretty little Samaipata, nestled between the dry eastern ridges of the Bolivian Andes, just a stone’s throw from the eastern hub of Santa Cruz. A small and sleepy backwater town that’s slowly becoming a favourite traveler stop-off, this one’s cobbled streets and charming painted cottages ooze a pueblo charm from each of their stuccoed cracks and whitewashed chimneys. But Samaipata’s endearing interior qualities aside, the real draws here are arguably on its peripheries. There, travelers can explore the mysterious El Fuerte stones, steeped in Guarani, Arawak and Incan histories alike, or wax up the walking boots and delve into the cloud forests of Amboro, which lie just to the north of town. "
"Tiwanaku, Bolivia","Set on the dry and dusty plains that roll between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, the dig site at Tiwanaku is a real must for any culturally and historically interested travelers making their way through Bolivia. Hailed as some of the most fascinating pre-Columbian ruins in all of South America, this collection of monolith gates and subterranean temple complexes tells the secrets of a virtually unknown civilisation. They were first discovered back in the 1500s, by the wandering conquistador Pedro Cieza de Leon, and are now thought to represent the last remaining vestige of the epicentre of the mighty Tiwanaku Empire; once a power that extended from Bolivia through to Chile and Peru! "
"Plaza Pedro de Anzúrez, Sucre","Sucre enjoys the rather prestigious position as Bolivia’s official capital, not to mention year-round highland breezes that keep the temperatures cool and the streets perennially fresh. Granted it’s nowhere near the most populous town in the country (Sucre has a meagre 300,000 people), and the government and state houses have all but relocated to altitudinous La Paz on the edge of the Cordillera Real, but Sucre is still the regal charm and witty conquistador of yesteryear. During the colonial years, the center here was flooded with moneyed mansion builders from nearby Potosi, raising the gorgeous whitewashed homes and Baroque majesty found around Plaza 25 de Mayo. Then came independence, and Sucre stood up – this UNESCO spot was where Bolivia’s revolution pretty much began! "
"Chulumani, Bolivia","Beset by seas of undulating cocoa plantations and banana trees, coffee and tropical palm gardens, the pretty little country town of Chulumani can be found cascading its way down the hillsides of the Sud Yungas. Much like its mountaintop brother of Coroico just a little down the road to the north-west, this high-perched city is one of the most popular destinations for travelers on the iconic Camino de las Yungas &#8211; the death-defying route that carves its way out of the ridges of the Bolivian Andes, falling away precipitously and meandering up the steep faces of the Cordillera Real. The town itself is known for its babbling mineral streams and dark histories, while many other people come to hit the hiking trails in the nearby wilds, spy out rare tropical butterflies, or join the raucous festival in late summer. "
"Rurrenabaque, Bolivia","A tenuous balance between backpacker, hiker hub and backwater Bolivian town has been struck at Rurrenabaque, where the waxy boughs and cacophonous tropical noises of the South American rainforest echo amidst the low-rise pueblo cottages and coffee-scented plazas. Famed for its enticing position right where the pampas meets the wilds of Madidi National Park of the upper Amazon, the town has proved a magnet for outdoorsy types and ecotourists in recent years. Some will head west, to the ziplines and monkey-dotted canopies of the primeval rainforests across the Beni River, while others will head east, to the outback town of Santa Rosa and the pampas, where alligators patrol the banks and anacondas lurk in the swamps. "
"Oruro, Bolivia","A town of hardened miners and mineral workers, straight-faced blue-collar folk and salt-of-the-earth types, Oruro makes its home on the windswept edge of the Altiplano. The undulating hills that delineate its seat in the eastern heartlands of Bolivia have long been the city’s main source of income too, offering oodles of tungsten and tin for generation after generation of prospectors to pull from the ground. Today, there’s something of a humble (very humble) tourist boom going on in Oruro, with one fine ethnography museum offering mummified remains and South American treasures, and that annual festival drawing whopping big crowds to see Uru rites, traditional costume and the enthralling so-called Dancers of the Devil. "
"Trinidad, Bolivia","Rising from the wetland plains of the Llanos de Moxos, Trinidad boasts a pretty little colonial heart and a fine location within easy reach of the wildernesses of the great pampas. In its center, travelers can laze and gaze amidst the palm trees and pretty Spanish-style edifices on the Plaza Mariscal Jose Ballivian. A quad of four fantastic city museums is a great way to get acquainted with the history and cultures of Beni (especially the Fish Fauna Museum, with its piranhas and river dolphins), while trips out to find the critically endangered Wagler&#8217;s macaw in the forests around town are also hugely popular. "
"Cochabamba, Bolivia","Delineated by the folds and contours of the Altiplano and the Andes, Cochabamba sprawls out at the base of its own plain, almost midway between Santa Cruz and La Paz. An enticing metropolis of more than 500,000 people, this one’s gritty barrios and dramatic geographical location make for a fine balance of urban living and outdoorsy pursuits. By morning, travelers can work off their hangovers by shopping through the buzzing stalls of La Cancha and sipping chicha corn beers on the sun-splashed plazas. Later, hit the peaks of the snow-tipped Tunari in the distance, where hang-gliding and hiking are both possible amidst the hills. "
"Tarija, Bolivia","Peppered with palms and kissed by the warm tropical breezes of the Bolivian south, Tarija remains largely off-the-beaten-track. Tourists rarely plan to make a beeline to the regional capital, while those who do are often surprised by its elegant Governor’s Mansion (done out in bold white and blues), laid-back Spanish feel and sun-baked cottages with their trademark Andalusian roofs and patios. However, Tarija’s real draw has to be its location on the edge of one of Bolivia’s most prolific wine growing regions: the Central Valley of Tarija. Here, some of the vineyards hail in as the world’s highest, and countless cellar doors offer tasting sessions throughout the year. "
Travnik Castle,"Bisected by the babbling Lasva River as it flows through the central mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the pretty mid-sized town of Travnik does well to balance its interesting past as the capital and stronghold of the erstwhile viziers of this old Ottoman sub-region and modern day adventure sports and outdoorsy draws. The first aspect manifests in a curious array of traditional eastern-style edifices and monuments, two Ottoman clock towers (unique throughout the country) and a handsome 15th-century old town heart. The second aspect makes its home on the slopes of Vlasic Mountain on the horizon, which is now one of Bosnia’s most celebrated skiing, Nordic walking and hiking destinations. "
Jahorina,"Home to the best-loved ski field in all of Bosnia and former host of the Winter Olympics, Jahorina draws snow lovers and summertime hikers alike to its high perch amidst the pine-spotted upper levels of the Dinaric Alps. Of course it’s the lifts and pistes here that take centre stage for most travelers, with no fewer than 10 chairs and a planned gondola serving 30 kilometers of groomed alpine runs. But Jahorina isn’t only for when the snow falls; not with the hunting lodges and pre-historic wonders of the Orlovaca cave system nearby, along with the pretty town of Pale beckoning from the valley below. "
Sarajevo,"A bustling, bubbling and surprising European capital that’s now heading full throttle into the modern age, Sarajevo has all but shed its former reputation as a ravaged war zone. Memorials to the fallen and killed from the tumultuous conflicts of the 1990s do still fringe the city’s districts, but there’s certainly a newfound confidence and panache flowing through the central streets; one that embodies a real defiance for the atrocities of war. Think striking mosques looming over al fresco beer bars, aromatic Turkic restaurants peppering enchanting bazaars, pretty city parks and arched stone bridges, all underpinned by modern art museums, jazz fests and more! "
Trebinje,"One of the real gems of the Republika Srpska side of Bosnia Herzegovina, Trebinje reflects beautifully against the waters of the winding Trebisnjica River as it cuts through the heart of the city’s historic centre; a medley of elegant Ottoman rises and original eastern facades that was constructed largely in the 18th century. There’s also the pretty arched bridge of Arslanagic to see on the edge of town, along with a gorgeous Serbian Orthodox cathedral on the ridges above. Travelers should also be sure to scale to the crumbling remnants of the Klobuk fortress on the hill, which offers sweeping views of the Trebisnjica River valley. "
Stolac,"Hemmed in by the grass-green and craggy ridges of the Herzegovina Humina, Stolac is considered by many to be single most beautiful town in the country. Amidst its enchanting old heart, the spot fuses layer after layer of unique architectural and cultural heritage, going from the crumbling remnants of Roman Diluntum that stood here in the 3rd century to the elegance of Austro-Hungarian Baroque. Then there are the haunting tombstones of the Radimlja necropolis on the edge of the town to see, along with the pretty riparian stretches of the Bregava River, complete with clicking wooden watermills and real-stone bridges. "
"Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina","One of the undisputed jewels of the entire Balkan Peninsula, Mostar oozes Bosnian history from each of its Byzantine cracks, Slavic crevices and Ottoman facades. The piece de resistance has to be the arched Old Bridge that spans the Neretva at the town’s heart, now meticulously reconstructed following destruction in the Croat–Bosniak conflict and a bearer of that coveted UNESCO tag. And all around this masterpiece cast in stone, Mostar layers Dalmatian builds and Franciscan churches, oriental designs and arabesque mosques into one glorious aesthetic, while gold sellers continue to barter in the Old Bazaar and beer drinkers sip lagers in al fresco terraces by the riverside. "
Jajce,"Indelibly green and bolstered by the roaring waterfalls that cascade through the urban bluffs at its heart, welcoming Jajce is one of the favoured gateways to the lakes and gorges of the pretty Bosanska Krajina region of the north. Back in the town itself and travelers can discover a clutch of fascinating museums, like the AVNOJ that chronicles the resistance efforts of the Yugoslav partisans in World War Two, underground catacombs, charming Bosnian-style homes dressed in painted timber and – of course – the unmissable citadel that sprawls over the central hill – a remnant of the town’s medieval past. "
Brcko,"Brcko can be found straddling the borderlands with Croatia to the north, planted on the edge of the Sava River and home to Bosnia’s only real port worthy of note. While the town boasts a smattering of elegant Hapsburg edifices and an endearing blue-collar vibe, the real reason it’s worth a visit is because of its unique position as the country’s only self-governing city, where the various factions that only decades before now were embroiled in the Croat–Bosniak-Serb conflicts mix and forge their own unique enclave and personality on the edge of BiH Federation and the Republika Srpska alike. "
Banja Luka,"Razed and razed again by both earthquake and war, Banja Luka – the largely unknown capital of the Republika Srpska region of Bosnia and Herzegovina – retains little of the historic Ottoman and Slavic richness it once exuded, save a few reconstructed gems like the Cathedral of Saint Bonaventure and rebuilt, erstwhile-UNESCO Ferhat-Pasha Mosque. However it’s not for the sights that people head to this 200,000-strong city in the wooded Vrbas River valley. No sir, they come to sip beers and get loose to the sounds of the region’s famous thumping electro-folk, sample Trappist wines in the Pivara Banjaluka monastery (the only of its kind in the Balkans) and hit the hiking trails of the mountains on the horizon. "
Kravice Falls,"A truly photogenic wonder of Bosnia’s backcountry, the Kravice Falls cascade in countless streams over the verdant ridges south of Mostar. More than 25 meters high, the cataracts here attract swimmers and strollers during the summer months, while others will come to simply gawp as the mist rises from the freezing plunge pools and roaring Trebizat River (daring types may also want to try their hand at the on-site rope swing that can be seen depositing fearless locals into the waters). Kravice is best accessed from nearby Ljubuski, while others will rent a car out of Mostar and drive down through the dense fir forests. "
Una National Park,"Shrouded in beautiful swathes of virgin forest, the Una National Park is one of the more recent additions to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s line-up of outdoorsy gems. It makes its home amidst the wild hills that roll down from the Dinaric Alps on the cusp of Croatia, protecting great stretches of riparian woodland and the channels of the Una and Unac Rivers. Visitors who make their way here can look forward to the striking waterfalls at Martin Brod, interesting sights like the soaring Ostrovica Fortress and the newly-reconstructed Rmanj Monastery, complete with its reworking of the Serbian Orthodox style. "
Tuzla,"While Tuzla might not immediately seem like the best place to while away your Bosnian days and its place smack bang in the industrial heartland of the nation might not seem attractive from the get go, this colourful and confident town is actually a great place to feel the pulse of the real, raw BiH. Travelers can delve into a clean and well-pruned old town that comes complete with soaring minarets and stone-clad squares, sunbathe on the edge of curious salt lakes (a remnant of the ancient Pannonian Sea), and experience the country’s most prestigious literary festival with the onset of the Mesa Selimovic event in July. "
Bihac,"An endearing little town that sits draped between the ridges of the verdant Una Valley, Bihac comes shrouded in blooming coniferous shades of green and the rugged hills of the Bosanska Krajina. At the town’s centre stands a square-cut medievalist keep and its concomitant church tower, while a series of pop-up islands beset by the turquoise-green channels of the Una itself make for some seriously good urban park strolling. There’s also a pretty new town square to wander through, complete with babbling fountain installations, along with an interesting arabesque Ottoman tomb to boot. "
Blagaj,"A real must on any Bosnian bucket list, Blagaj sits nestled in the depths of a rugged gorge of the Mostar Basin, right on the spot that the Buna River bursts into existence from the subterranean depths below. In fact, the town’s most-visited site sits neatly on the edge of the Buna’s source, rising in beautiful Ottoman styles to form the great Sufi lodge of the Tekija. But that’s not all the town can offer. No sir, there’s elegant Ottoman mansions besides, along with a series of fascinating arched bridges in the Byzantine style and earthy homestays with timber terraces and cosy rooms aplenty. "
Blidinje Nature Park,"This wide plateau that connects the Cvrsnica and Vran peaks in the south-western edge of Bosnia and Herzegovina remains one of the nation’s less-trodden and off-the-beaten-track natural gems. It’s famed for the colossal trunks of its endemic Bosnian pine trees, while it also boasts thick forests where white-bark evergreens shroud a flower-peppered woodland floor. The whole area is also peppered with elaborately carved medieval stele that hearken back to the Orthodox traditions of pre-Ottoman Bosnia. Blidinje comes complete with a web of marked hiking trails that make it a great option for walkers and outdoorsy types. "
Okavango Delta Zebra&#8217;s,"The Okavango Delta is one of the most inspiring and awe-inspiring wilderness locations in Africa, if not the entire planet. The Delta is a truely unspoiled wilderness with terrain ranging from dry grasslands to swamps. Safaris and game watching are the most popular activities in the park and possible animals to be sighted include cheetahs, zebra, giraffes, elephants, crocodiles and rhinos to name only a few. Trips should be properly planned because, although the terrain here is always stunning, the seasons can dramatically effect your chances of seeing certain animals. "
Leopard Cup at Moremi Game Reserve,"Voted the best game reserve in the African continent in 2008, this park has a lot going for it. It is the first reserve that was solely founded by local residents who were growing ever more concerened about natural and man-made threats to the local enviroment and wildlife.  Situated on the east side of the Okavango Delta, the reserve offers some of the most stunning scenery in the country and boasts an equally impressive ecosystem. Many tourists choose to visit the park by self-drive campervan but the park also has a number of great campsites. "
"Gabane, Botswana","This village is not far from Gaborone and is a great location for exploring the hills on foot. The village is surprisingly industrious and houses a number of small manufacturers such as glassworks, metal and pottery on the aptly named Pelegano Village Industry. The pottery factory in Gabane is particularly worth a visit due to its shop selling wares such as crockery, vases and other handcrafted decorative items. The most popular reason for visiting the village however is the great location for hiking. "
"Elephant Family in Kasane, Botswana","Kasane is situated between the Four Corners of Africa; where Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zamibia meet. It is a great spot to stay for visits to the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe or Botswana&#8217;s own Chobe National Park. The town&#8217;s own attractions include a huge Baobab tree that was once used as a prison due to its trunk that is so large a human can enter. There is also a snake park that houses around 50 snakes from 17 different species. The town is also wonderfully situated for exploring the Chobe River. "
Maun,"Maun is often used by tourists as a stepping stone for the Okavango Delta but it has enough about it to merit a few nights stay. The hotels, restaurants and tourist amenities here are some of the best in the country, largely due to the fact that the city is the main tourist stop in the country. Whilst the town itself does not have much going for it, it still attracts a wide range of people from luxury safari travelers to volounteers. There are some great campsites that are located by the river, providing a great place to stay for a few nights. "
Poor Neighborhood in Gaborone,"The city of Gaborone is the largest in Botswana and also its capital. The modern buildings of Gaborone set against the tropical backdrops of this African nation are an unusual sight and despite its size, there are not too many reasons to visit the city. The large residential areas are supplemented by a few decent hotels and restaurants. The modern feel of the city is reinforced by its lack of history but it is certainly paving the way for the countries future and for this reason it is a good place to experience the vibe of 21st Century Botswana. "
Chobe National Park,"This game reserve is the third largest in Botswana but it has one of the largest concentrations of rare game animals in the continent of Africa. The national park takes its name from the Chobe River which, at first glance is guaranteed to take your breathe away. As well as being a beautiful sight, the river supports an ecosystem of rare and exotic creatures including birds, elephants, lions, giraffes, baboons and buffalo. During the winter season it is possible to see a herd of hundreds of elephants at a time; a truely once in a lifetime experience. "
Francistown,The oldest town in Botswana is the second largest in the country. Francistown was built on gold mining before Europeans came and looked to prosper from it themselves. In fact the town takes its name from a British man; Daniel Francis. The main sights in the town include the Supa Ngwao Museum which documents the life and culture of the Kalanga people through various exhibits. There is also a refuge for orphaned wild animals called Birds and Game Botswana. The town is currently experiencing an economic boom due to the recent resurgence of gold mining. 
Central Kalahari Game Reserve,"Wild, mysterious and amazingly vast, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve is a true wilderness that will give you the impression that you are exploring Africa alone. Incredible grasslands engulf you by day whilst the skies at night are as clear as the clearest in the world. The rain in summer brings about countless wild beasts of all shapes and sizes including massive herds of animals like wildebeast and springbok. Without so many animals in the harsher winter months, the main reason to visit the Central Kalahari Game Resrve is the unfathomable open terrain and true African wilderness. "
Blue waxbill (Uraeginthus angolensis) in Jwaneng,"Built on the richest diamond mine in the world, the name Jwaneng literally means the place of small stones; these small stones are far more valuable than your average pebble however. In just one year the mine produced over 13 million carats from a whopping 10.5 million tons worth of ore. The town has amenities such as guest houses and restaurants. The mine here also supports the nearby Jwana Game Park which recently introduced two white rhinos. "
Tsodilo Hills,"The Tsodilo Hills appear almost suddenly out of the ground in the northwest Kalahari. These imposing rock formations of varying shapes and sizes are made to love even more impressive by the relative flatness of the surrounding land in the Kalahari. The Tsodillo Hills are a Unesco World Heritage site and are home to an amazing 4000 cave paintings spread out over 200 locations. The cave paintings, along with other evidence, suggests that the hills were first inhabited over 30,000 years ago. The best time to visit is in the winter months as summer can be blisteringly hot. "
Makgadikgadi Pans National Park,The name may be a mouthful but the reasons to visit Makgadikgadi Pans National Park are simple. The park stretches from the Boteti River and for this reason supports a vast and diverse ecosystem. The wildlife is particularly varied in the dry season when animals come from miles around to the river which is the only source of water for a long way. 
Baobab Tree in Gweta,"Although mainly used as a stop off for tourists on the way to Muan or Kasane, Gweta is worth visiting for its namesake, the species of bullfrog that live in the area. The frogs hide themselves in the sand until it rains and they can emerge from their sandy slumber. Other than these amazing creatures, there is little to see in Gweta, although the fuel station here is handy for pass through and will probably see you call in at some point during your time here. "
Kang,"Kang has a real travel vibe due to its location between Namibia, South Africa and Botswana. It is certainly not the most attractive place in Botswana, neither does it pack in the most attractions or sights but the town has amenities such as restaurants and guest houses which can be used as bases or as part of an onward journey in Botswana. The restaurants in Kang are unlikely to be the most memorable meals during your time in the country but they are affordable and hearty. "
Sunset in Savuti,"Savuti is one of the most popular safari destinations in Botswana due to its prime location in the very corner of the Chobe National Park. Throughout the year, all of the most popular and impressive animals (with the exception of rhinos) visit the region due to the river here. The landscape here is large and somewhat barren but was once a superlake that filled a void in Northern Botswana. The area has a wealth of luxury lodges for travellers looking to spend money for the best of the best. There are also great campsites for drivers through the area. "
Rio de Janeiro,"There’s just no other place like Rio.  Welcome to lush mountains, brilliant beaches, over the top nightlife, and fanatic football fans. Known as Cidade Maravilhosa, the Marvellous City, Rio is ringed by green mountains while the coast stretches for miles. Most people come first for the beaches.  The cariocas (locals) consider the beach a home away from home and so much happens here that you could never leave and still have a complete vacation. You’ll love biking on the beach, hiking in Tijuca rainforest, hang gliding, rock climbing, and sailing to one of several small islands just off the coast. Music is everywhere in the city – with the most popular being the African influenced samba vibe. If you want to explore the nightlife, head to Lapa, the cities red-light distinct. You’ll find live music and street parties every night. "
Salvador,"Located in the state of Bahia, Salvador has a phenomenal energy that’s notable even for Brazil.  Most known for being Portugal’s New World capital, it maintains a great deal of its colonial architecture and you’ll find the historic centre of the town in the Pelourinho neighbourhood. Here you’ll find large squares with small cobblestone alleys leading away, multi-coloured buildings, and churches like São Francisco with gilt woodwork and other baroque features. There’s an amazing arts movement here. You’ll find Olodum drummers on the streets, along with Capoeira martial artists, and crazy festivals happening everywhere you look. The culture here is decidedly Afro-Brazilian and you’ll see that in the incredible food, religious ceremonies and rituals, and dance. "
Ilhabela,"Another in the long list of incredible things about Brazil is São Paulo state. It offers some of the best of the best that the country has to offer.  São Paulo city is the current Boom Town – everything here is growing:  commerce, industry, culture, finance, and, of course, tourism. But you can also leave the city for a bit and head to Serra da Mantiqueira.  Use this stunning mountain range, with its 2500m peaks, as your cosy mountain getaway. There’s also Ilhabela, to be used as your posh island escape. Or try Iporanga in the midst of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. You’ll also find great beaches with the rainforest as their backdrop – try the lovely Ubatuba for a relaxing few days. "
São Paulo City,"The heartbeat of Sao Paulo State is Sao Paulo city.  It’s the largest city in Brazil and one of the largest in the world.  It’s a bit of a melting pot, with all kinds of ethnic groups calling it home, including the largest community of Japanese outside of Japan. You’ll find unbelievable art galleries and experimental theatres, as well as fantastic fine-dining restaurants and upscale bars.  If you want a taste of sophisticated city life, this is your stop. With 20 million people, Sao Paulo is a mammoth city, and does come with a lot of big city hassles, but for those willing to look a little closer; there is a vibe here that rivals New York City. "
Brasilia,"Built in the 1960’s, Brazil’s capital is a thoroughly planned and intricately organized city. Brasilia’s landmark infrastructure is laid out in the form of an airplane. Each section of the plane is a different district like residential, government, finance, culture, and commerce.  The architecture here attracts tourists and professional architects alike.  Be sure to check out the Three Powers Square.  Here you’ll find the Supreme Court, Congress, and the Presidential Palace. "
Fortaleza,"Another of Brazil’s big cities is Fortaleza.  It’s best known for an energetic cultural scenes, great beaches, and even greater shopping. If you’re going for the beaches, check out Meireles, Mucuripe, Iracema, and everyone’s favourite, Praia do Futuro. Spend your mornings strolling through Centro, the oldest part of the city, and then spending your evenings in Praira de Iracema, a neighbourhood densely packed with hotels, restaurants, and nightlife. Once you’ve had your fill of Fortaleza beaches, use it as starting point to discover the quaint fishing villages and rolling dune beaches of the Ceará coast. "
Paraty,"One of the most popular stops for tourists is located along Brazil’s Green Coast in the state of Rio de Janeiro.  Paraty is bursting with waterfalls, emerald green sea, giant coastal mountains and tropical forests. Once a Portuguese colony, the heart of the town is still the historic centre. Complete with multicoloured colonial buildings and cobbled streets built in the 17th century during the height of the Brazilian gold rush.  Many of the houses have been converted to bed and breakfasts’ which the locals call pousadas.  The entire historic district is great for strolling as the lanes are closed to cars.  It really feels like you’ve stepped back in time. Don’t forget to check out the colonial forts – many that still have their original cannons – and Capela de Santa Rita, a lovely 18th century church. "
Boa Viagem Beach in Recife,"There is nothing not to love about the “Venice of Brazil.”  Inside the city is a network of waterways, bridges, islets, and peninsulas, and just outside are tropical rainforests with rivers and islands to explore.  There is a wonderful historic old town here, as well as incredible culture and fantastic beaches.  The old town is known as Recife Antigo and is located on its own island near the harbour. Most would agree that Boa Viagem is the most popular beach in town due to the white sands and coral reef. Recife is a large city with lots to offer – including an awesome place to spend Carnaval. "
Olinda,"Six kilometres from Recife is Olinda, is a 16th century Portuguese colonial town. The historic old town sits on a hill surrounded by trees and filled with churches, museums, and restaurants. In 1982 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site.  The rest of the town is no less charming with tons of 18th century architecture, monasteries and convents, and fantastically painted houses.  Once a leader in the sugarcane industry, Olinda has transformed into a small artists’ colony; full of artists, workshops, studios, and other creative types.  Check out the pousadas in the old town if you’re interested in using Olinda as a base to enjoy Recife. And Carnaval is slightly different here.  Celebrated primarily during the day with the music and dance focused on traditional African culture. "
Manaus,"Considered by many as the gateway to the Amazon Rainforest, Manaus sits on the Negro River. The capital of Amazonas and one of the largest cities in the country it has incredible landmarks like the Rio Negro Palace and the Amazonas Opera House.  If you’re in the mood for some phenomenal nature, check out the Meeting of the Waters, a three mile stretch where the Solimões and the Negro Rivers run side by side without fully mixing. Eventually, both rivers converge to form the Amazon. Most people come here as a stopping point on their way into, or out of, the Amazon. If you’ve got time, check out the zoo that lets many of the animals roam free, and a little beachside museum just outside the city centre. "
Iguazu Falls,"This stunning natural wonder runs for 2.7km along the border with Argentina.  Iguazu Falls is a series of waterfalls along the Iguazu. The combination of luscious green forest, exotic wildlife, and breathtaking waterfalls is intoxicating.  Use the city of Foz do Iguaçu as your base camp as you enjoy cascades like the 80 metre Devil’s Throat.  With hundreds of fall’s to discover, you might consider a tour in one of the tourist rubber boats called zodiacs. "
Bonito,"Bonito is a one-street town full of charisma.  It serves as an ecotourism model for Brazil and as a hub for the surrounding areas.  If you’re an outdoor adventurer and water enthusiast, then this is your spot.  Discover Abismo Anhumas, a gigantic cavern covered in stalactite where you can dive and swim in an underground lake as well as do some abseiling.  Or how about snorkelling in the crystal clear Rio da Prata? If you’re a bird lover you won’t want to miss the macaws that nest deep in the Buraco das Araras. To top it all off, explore the Serra da Boduquena National Park. "
São Luís,"The historic centre of São Luís has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its well-restored colonial mansions. There are so many museums, crafts, and galleries to explore while here. São Luís maintains a largely Afro-Brazilian culture and you’ll find both reggae and Bumba Meu Boi music festivals. While you’re here be sure to catch the Centro de Cultura, a museum with exhibits on the three major Brazilian festivals.  You might also like the Archaeological Museum and the Casa das Tulhas, a 19th century market building. When you’re ready, cross the Baía de São Marcos for a quick day trip to Alcântara to see this historic town as it slowly slips into tropical decay. "
Jericoacoara Beach,"This hidden gem is one of the spectacular beaches in Ceara, Brazil. Named by the Washington Post as one of the Top 10 Most Beautiful Beaches in the world, you’ll find calm seas, white sand dunes, and gorgeous blue lagoons. It’s a nesting spot for large turtles and therefore was declared an Environmental Protection Area; it’s also been a national park since 2002. Thanks to all that, the area has remained largely isolated and untouched. They’ve had electricity for less than 20 years in Jeri and thanks to local ordinance; the streets can only be lit by the moon. "
Curitiba,"This thoroughly urban capital of Paraná state is a well-known performance centre.  Visit the Wire Opera, a steel tube building with a see-through roof, as well as the Guaíra Theatre for some great programs. Curitiba is also well known to urban planners across the globe as one of the most efficient cities ever built.  You’ll find a six-block stretch designated as a pedestrian zone, tones of parks and trees, innovative solutions to urban problems like pollution and poverty. It’s a unique place to recharge before ending your Brazilian adventure. "
Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque,"Bandar Seri Begawan (or just BSB) is perhaps the most richly-adorned capital you&#8217;ve never heard of. Home to just 50,000 people, it&#8217;s a pint-sized lesson in how oil money can change the world. Having been transformed in the last century, from a seaside trading town to the gilded epicenter of drilling and home of the great Sultan of Brunei, the town hosts wondrous – if a tad gaudy – sights like the gold-tipped Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque and the colossal Istana Nurul Iman, which holds the world record for the largest governmental building on the globe. There&#8217;s also fascinating Islamic craft on display in the Brunei Museum, and oodles of shopping to be had in the malls of Gadong. "
Ulu Temburong National Park,"The revered Green Jewel of Brunei, Ulu Temburong sits nestled deep in the recesses of the country&#8217;s eastern exclave. A veritable mecca for ecotourists and wildlife lovers, it&#8217;s been hailed across the globe as a fine example of state-sponsored conservation. In all, it covers a whopping 550 square kilometers of primeval rainforest, and hosts the exotic likes of rhinoceros hornbills and swinging gibbon colonies. Visitors who make their way here can enjoy safaris on specially constructed rope bridges in the canopies, which offer a unique perspective atop the old growth jungle. "
Kampong Ayer,"Sat smack bang in the middle of the winding Brunei River as it weaves through the heart of Bandar Seri Begawan, this standalone area of the city can be seen as a destination in its own right. Also known as, simply, the water village, it&#8217;s formed completely by homes that jut just above the channels on stilts. Many are connected with rickety boardwalks, and play host to happy local families who love showing unexpected visitors around. The only way to reach Kampong Ayer is by flagging down a water taxi from the banks in BSB. "
Pekan Tutong,"Pekan Tutong (that&#8217;s just Tutong Town in English) is the regional hub for the whole Tutong District – the area found immediately to the east of Bandar Seri Begawan on the northern edge of Brunei. Located right on the edge of the South China Sea, it&#8217;s home to a clutch of acclaimed schools and a few good guesthouses. However, the major pull is surely the golden stretch of sand that lines the city at Seri Kenangan. This sparkling, wide beach runs along the courses of the Tutong River, and plays host to enticing beach bars and seafood restaurants as it goes – it&#8217;s surely one of the top places for sun, sand and sea in all of Brunei. "
Kuala Belait,"Rubbing shoulders with Malaysian Sarawak on the very western edge of Brunei, this oil-fed town of nodding donkeys offers an image of the Brunei of the modern age. Bustling and packed with business folk who&#8217;ve come from afar to seek out petroleum beneath the ground, it&#8217;s also home to the famous teapot roundabout. It&#8217;s also got its very own beachfront, which finds its zenith with the welcoming little park at Silver Jubilee. For food, shopping and souvenirs, also be sure to make a beeline for the Tudong Saji: a bazaar that erupts after dark with fish dishes and Asian crafts. "
Gadong,"Bustling with the biggest bazaars and marketplaces in all of Brunei, the area of Gadong – officially a separate town, though much more like a suburb of the capital at Bandar Seri Begawan – is the place to go for shopping in this small Asian nation. Start with the huge malls, which are packed with electronics sellers and high-street fashion outlets, not to mention the only McDonald&#8217;s brand in the country (hence the perpetual queue!). And when the evening comes, it&#8217;s time to hit the energetic night market, which throbs with smelly fish stalls and stir-fry stands, the fragrances of tamarind and ginger and chili and soy all wafting through the air. "
Muara,"Muara juts out into the South China Sea with its own needle-shaped finger of land, forming the western end of the populous Brunei and Muara District. Known primarily as one of the sultanate&#8217;s top beach towns, its home to a great stretch of golden sand and a clutch of picnic spots and playgrounds for those with kids in tow (look for the manicured lawns of the Muara Beach Recreational Park). Other pleasant walks can be had along the palm-dotted spit of Serasa Beach to the south, while views out across the ferry-dotted ocean are to die for. "
Andulau Forest Reserve,"A sea of waxy palms and ancient teak trees awaits travelers in the Andulau Forest Reserve, which sits neatly placed in the midst of Brunei, just a short jaunt east from the capital. Made famous by the proliferation of old growth evergreen woods that dominates its interior, the area is also endowed with wild, muddy rivers and crashing waterfalls with splash pools for swimming. Don&#8217;t expect to see many locals here (it&#8217;s one of the least-populated parts of the Sultanate), unless – that is – you mean tropical creatures in the ilk of rare clouded leopards and monkeys overhead! "
Bangar,"One of the few towns to be found in Brunei&#8217;s exclave of Temburong, Bangar represents the administrative and commercial heart of this detached district in the east. A small and compact place, it is well-connected to the capital at Bandar Seri Begawan by speed boat, which can be seen departing from the jetties of the riverside harbors here from morning until night. The real draw of this place is surely the wild rainforests that lurk on the edges of town, with the legendary Labu Forest and the aforementioned Ulu Temburong National Park both on the menu. However, it&#8217;s also a good spot to meet the locals and get to grips with the wilder character of the eastern region. "
Labi,"Nestled deep in the south-western corner of the Sultanate, little Labi town is one of the top spots for ecotourists heading to Brunei. Essentially just a clutch of bamboo homes and rain-doused villages, it sits right on the edge of the wild Labi Forest Reserve. That means guests get to keep company with gibbons and geckos and all manner of other woodland fauna, all whilst seeking out gushing waterfalls and swamps and hidden forest trekking trials. A smattering of good nature lodges can be found in the village, while nearby Terawan and Tarunan also have other guesthouse options of their own. "
Seria,"Roughly contiguous with the aforementioned town of Kuala Belait, Seria also makes its home on the northern coastline of Brunei, where the sands and the city promenades dip down into the South China Sea. Now famed for its wealth of prolific oil wells, the area is peppered with nodding donkeys and the recognizable relics of that decades-old petroleum industry. In fact, Seria&#8217;s very history has been defined by oil since the very beginning, with WWII battles between the Allies and the Japanese taking place here as the two powers vied for control of Brunei&#8217;s rich petroleum wealth. "
Labi Forest Reserve,"Named for the small village on its periphery, the vast reserves of the Labi Forest range from the south-western flats of Brunei to the borderlands where the Gunung Mulu park of Malaysia crashes down from the Borneo highlands. It&#8217;s a wild and untamed place, offering breathtaking viewpoints over the tops of the jungles, the gushing waterfalls of Wasai Kadir, and chances to see rare rainforest creatures on the trails. Another major pull are the traditional longhouses of the Iban folk, which line the dirt tracks close to the reserve. "
Jerudong Park,"Jerudong is a flash place of neon signs and in-your-face attractions, located just on the edge of the ocean and directly west of central Bandar Seri Begawan. Although now largely contiguous with the capital, the suburb has its own distinct character; largely thanks to the brightly-lit casinos and flamboyant gaming halls that line up along the streets by the bucket load. The go-getter vibe is carried on by one mind-boggling roundabout shaped like a giant diamond ring, not to mention the countless theme parks and manmade beaches, where loop-de-loops meet babbling water fountains and country clubs. "
Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park,"Surrounded by the protected hinterland of the Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park (one of the top conservation areas in the sultanate as a whole), this huge lake – the largest natural lake in the country, no less – draws in visitors with the promise of unique flora and fauna. Around its tiger lily-spotted banks, you&#8217;ll see age-old skiffs docked on weathered jetties, all of which are shrouded by the blooming greens of the jungle canopy. It&#8217;s there where the white-collared fruit bats flit between the branches; there where the clouded leopards and the red leaf monkeys stalk the undergrowth. "
Hutan Simpan Berakas Park,"Another fine example of Brunei&#8217;s lush and verdant backcountry comes in the form of the Hutan Simpan Bukit Ladan park, which buts up to the Malay border on the western edge of Tutong District. Be sure to pack one sturdy and sure pair of walking boots for this one, because the trails often come caked in mud and slippery as they pierce deep into the jungles. You&#8217;ll be able to seek out interesting blooms of orchids between the fern fields, wonder at colossal teak trees caked in moss, and even take a canopy walk that lets you survey the vast hills from atop the rainforests that blanket them. "
Marlow,"The town of Malow is an exceptionally pretty Thameside community, with resplendent mansions by the water and lots of fun and interesting things happening on the river in summer. Marlow is one of the towns on the Thames where &#8220;swan upping&#8221; takes place. By a peculiar historical law, all unmarked mute swans are the queen&#8217;s property, and around late-July the crown takes a census of the swans by rounding them up, tagging them and releasing them again. Marlow&#8217;s bridge is a miniature version of the famous Chain Bridge in Budapest, having been designed by the same man, William Tierney Clark in the late-1820s. "
Bletchley Park,"A &#8220;new town&#8221; that only came to be in the 1960s, Milton Keynes differs from the other destinations on this list because its charms don&#8217;t lie in its distant history, landscape or architecture. Rather, Milton Keynes is where you can uncover a riveting chapter of 20th-century. In the southeast of the town is Bletchley Park, where the British codebreakers like Alan Turning cracked the Lorenz and Enigma ciphers in the Second World War. A couple of streets away is the National Museum of Computing, which has a cache of machines from the earliest years of the computer era, including the Colossus, which helped crack the Lorenz cipher. "
"King&#8217;s Head Inn, Aylesbury","Buckinghamshire&#8217;s county town has a lovely Georgian centre, with timber Tudor and Jacobean houses sprinkled here and there. One of these is the King&#8217;s Head Coaching Inn, a medieval pub set around a cobbled courtyard where horses were once stabled. A market still sets up four days a week in Amersham in front of the County Court, which itself dates to 1740. In Aylesbury you really should take the chance to get out into the Chilterns. Coombe Hill is close by and has awesome vistas that include the Prime Minister&#8217;s residence at Chequers. And nearby Waddesdon Manor looks like it has landed straight from the Loire Valley, and was constructed for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild as a weekend retreat. "
"Old Gaol, Buckingham","A powerful settlement in Anglo-Saxon times, Buckingham was granted county town status as far back as the 900s by King Alfred the Great. A devastating fire hit Buckingham in 1725, and the rebuild brought us the elegant Georgian streetscapes that we see today. Right on the high street is the Old Gaol, which looks a bit like a castle for its romantic gothic revival design, and dates to the 18th century. Inside there&#8217;s a neat little museum about Buckingham, also portraying some of the people incarcerated here in the 1700s and 1800s. The Chantry Chapel is run by the National Trust and one of the oldest buildings here, mostly from the 1400s. One of the foremost English gardens is minutes away at Stowe, and is spectacular in any season. "
"The Guildhall, High Wycombe","In a steep valley in the Chilterns, High Wycombe is an agreeable town with a market that trades on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. A lot of the most beautiful architecture is around the pedestrianised high street, which is mostly Georgian. Seek out the Pepper Pot, the arcaded market hall designed by the prolific 18th-century architect Robert Adam, and the marvellous Guildhall, also arcaded and from 1757. Just on the northern outskirts of High Wycombe is Hughenden Manor, the grand red brick mansion where the prime minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in the 19th century. The house has been kept as it was in Disraeli&#8217;s day, and his study and library will enthuse any students of Victorian history. "
"St Mary&#8217;s Church, Wendover","A very picturesque little town in the Chilterns, Wendover is a lovely place to stop while walking through on the Ridgeway National Trail or doing a driving tour of the hills. There&#8217;s a smattering of locally-owned amenities like antiques shops, tea rooms, pubs, delicatessens and chocolate shops. And the street scenes are a delight, with timber-framed thatched cottages and grand coaching inns. A short drive from Wendover is the Chiltern Brewery, the oldest independent brewery in the Chiltern range, boasting several award-winning labels. The Chiltern Brewery welcomes visitors for tours of their brew house, and a combined beer and food tasting experience. "
Great Missenden,"This lovely, well-heeled village has had some very famous residents, including two prime ministers and Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. But none stayed as long as the beloved children&#8217;s author Roald Dahl who lived in Great Missenden for 36 years, during which time he wrote his most popular works. The village has plotted the Roald Dahl Village Trail, which will show you to sights around the village known to have inspired the writer, and also takes in his grave. Bring the little guys to the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, commemorating his stories and characters, and introducing them to a new generation. "
Princes Risborough,"The small but well-preserved market town of Princes Risborough is well worth an afternoon of exploration. On the high street is the 17th-century red brick market hall, capped with a cupola. And if you poke around the side streets with wrought iron lanterns you&#8217;ll stumble upon timber-framed houses and a handful of inviting country pubs. The Ridgeway National Trail runs close by on the way to Ivinghoe Beacon, and adorning the local Whiteleaf Hill is Whiteleaf Cross: This is a monumental chalk carving of a kind often found in the West Country, and has been dated to at least the early 1700s but could be much earlier. "
Bekonscot Model Village and Railway,"A very well-to-do market town, Beaconsfield has lots of independent shops and pubs to peruse, as well as some eccentric attractions that you won&#8217;t find anywhere else. One of these is the Bekonscot Model Village and Railway, officially the oldest model village in the world. It is the work of an accountant called Roland Callingham, who made the whole thing in his own back garden from 1929 onwards. A minute or two outside Beaconsfield is the Royal Standard of England, which claims to be the oldest pub in the country, with a history that can be traced back 900 years. Among the many important figures to cross the threshold was Charles I in the English Civil War. "
Chesham,"A terminus of the Metropolitan Line, Chesham has the rare quality of being a country town on London&#8217;s Underground. And it&#8217;s not just any location either, as the Chess River has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the Chilterns. The Chess Valley Walk is easy to get to from  Chesham and wends along the banks of this chalk river, known for its crystal clear waters, kingfishers, red kites and adorable little villages. "
Dashwood Mausoleum,"An endearing rural town with the southern Chilterns as a backdrop, West Wycombe&#8217;s past is inextricably linked with the Dashwood Family. One member of the clan, Sir Francis Dashwood was a notorious libertine and bon vivant, inauguating the pagan Hellfire Club in the mid-1700s. He excavated 500 metres of galleries in the chalk beneath the town where the Hellfire Club would meet for banquets, rituals and all sorts of other debauchery. After almost two centuries of dereliction the caves were restored after the war and are now a visitor attraction. The same goes for Dashwood&#8217;s pleasure palace, West Wycombe Park, an imposing mansion in the Palladian style. "
Stony Stratford,"In the northwest of Milton Keynes is an agreeable old town that stands in stark relief against the modern townscape close by. This community was one of the main stops on the road from Chester to London until it was bypassed by the railways in the 19th century, helping to freeze the town in time until the 20th century. Stony  Stafford has pubs, tea rooms, restaurants and artisan shops in prim Georgian properties. Scenes from the 1987 comedy Withnail and I were shot a few establishments around the picturesque market square. And, as if to underline Stony Stafford&#8217;s rural credentials, there&#8217;s a folk music festival every June on the Horsefair Green with bands from the region. "
"Varna, Bulgaria","The sun-splashed favourite of local Bulgarians heading out of <a href=""http://Sofia"">Sofia</a> and <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-plovdiv-bulgaria/"">Plovdiv</a> for the summer, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-varna-bulgaria/"">Varna</a> is much more than just your run-of-the-mill resort town on the edge of the Black Sea. Yes sir, with a long and enthralling history, oodles of crumbling Roman bathhouses and elaborate Orthodox architecture (like the almost unpronounceable Dormition of the Mother of God Cathedral), the city appeals to history buffs and culture vultures as well as sun seekers. Of course, the beaches are still a big factor, and one bustling sand-side promenade beckons travelers with oodles of seafood restaurants and cocktail bars, while lively clubs erupt right on the edge of the shore after dark. "
Veliko Tarnovo,"The legendary City of the Tsars stands aloft on the edge of the rising foothills of Bulgaria’s northern mountains. Bisected by the S-shaped meanders of the Yantra River, the town’s setting is nothing short of breathtaking, with terraces of terracotta-coloured roofs looming over the waterways below. The pretty cobblestone lanes and half-timbered homes of this one’s old town are prime examples of what’s now known as the Tarnovo school, which developed as the Second Bulgarian Empire boomed in the Middle Ages. That means travelers here experience a mixture of natural beauty – courtesy of the wild coniferous woods that blanket the landscapes all around – and unbridled culture and history, oozing from the Tsarevets capitol and the clutch of gorgeous Byzantine churches. "
"Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral, Sofia, Bulgaria","The sprawling <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-sofia-bulgaria/"">capital of Bulgaria</a> is something of a patchwork of its own past. Around its edges rise the great brutalist monuments to Soviet rule; endless streams of cookie cutting high-rises. Closer to the centre and the ancient remains of the Serdica Fort and the Roman-Byzantine Church of St George sit in the shadow of Stalinist municipal buildings. And then there are the iconic Orthodox domes and gilded edifices of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, which glisten under the snow-packed tops of Vitosha Mountain in the distance. It’s all very eclectic, and rarely fails to impress travelers that opt to linger here a little while. "
Zheravna,"A showcase in all things Bulgarian National Revival, Zheravna is a rustic and raw picture of one of the country’s most iconic architectural styles of old. The town itself sits nestled at the base of the mighty Balkan Mountains, between dense thickets of Bosnian pines and white elms, where it seems almost organically formed in its timber-clad, stony appearance. The cottages that pepper the cobbled streets all come beautifully restored, with more than 150 examples of the typical hardwood facades on display. Amidst the buildings, sites like the Yordan Yovkov House and the icon-packed St Nicholas Church draw the biggest crowds, while others will head for the August Dobromiritsa Rural Park nearby, where festivals celebrating Bulgarian folk costumes and music erupt throughout the year. "
Burgas,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-burgas-bulgaria/"">Burgas</a> is one of the favoured gateways to the southern stretches of the Black Sea Coast. A far cry from the ancient and historic centres that pepper the country elsewhere, it’s a largely modern affair of Art Deco rises and manicured parks on the edge of the sea. It’s also home to some of the most lively music festivals in Bulgaria, like the rollicking Spirit of Burgas that erupts each year in the summer. North Beach is the most popular stretch of sand in the town, while Burgas also has another trick up its sleeve: the majestically beautiful trio of lakes that range from the bird-spotting paradise of Vaya to the west to the saline waters of Atanasovsko to the north. "
Rila Monastery,"Perhaps the most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in the world, Rila has risen and risen to become a veritable symbol of the Bulgarian nation. It entered the UNESCO World Heritage List way back in 1983, hailed for its curious intermingling of Mamluk, arabesque, Byzantine and Romanesque styles, and resplendent iconostases walls, carved meticulously and inlaid with shimmering gold leaf. An on-site museums helps travelers unravel the more than 1,000 years of history that coalesce at the site, while endless courtyards and peristyles decorated in murals and medieval scenes mean there’s plenty of art and architecture to draw the eye. "
Bansko,"Prep the salopettes and wax the skis, because <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-to-do-in-bansko-bulgaria/"">Bansko</a> is Bulgaria’s most prized winter sports resort. With countless expansions and new lift projects at its back, the dual ski fields of the Chalin Valog and Shiligarnika that make their home between the fir forests here have become some of the most lauded in all of Eastern Europe. And even if you won’t be hitting the 70 kilometers of groomed runs on offer, Bansko’s rugged setting in the Pirin ranges and wealth of luxury hotels, hedonistic bars, jazz joints, cross-country trails and Bulgarian tavernas is sure to hit the spot! "
Pamporovo,"Encompassed by endless seas of pine trees that oscillate between verdant green and ice-caked white with the turning of summer and winter, the popular mountain resort town of Pamporovo makes its home amidst the undulating ridges of the southern Rhodope Mountains, just a short jaunt away from the borderlands with Greece. And while the warmer months here do mean fantastic hiking opportunities along the trails of Smolyan, it’s the snows that really draw the crowds, when the slopes (all 36 kilometers of them) open and chairlifts creak and rattle to the tips of Rhodope with skiers in tow. Pamporovo is expanding rapidly too, which means it’s certainly one to watch on Eastern Europe’s line-up of budding mountain resorts! "
Pirin National Park,"UNESCO-tagged and rising like a great Balkan bulwark against the borders of <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-places-visit-macedonia/"">Macedonia</a> and <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-places-visit-greece/"">Greece</a>, the Pirin National Park is a hinterland like no other in Europe. Up on high, its snow-spotted summits gather caps of mist, while alpine valleys below are dashed with avalanches of forest-green pine and fir trees, and speckled with the occasional bed of edelweiss. Meanwhile, deer and bears stalk the woodlands to this day, and wild goats clamber atop the craggy precipices to find shelter in the rocky crevices and caves. It’s hardly a wonder that this one is hailed as a paradise for hikers and outdoorsy types, with trails soaring to the top of Vihren (the highest peak) and weaving around the whopping 186 mountain lakes! "
Belogradchik Fortress,"The otherworldly geological wonders that lurk on the edge of Belogradchik town rarely fail to impress travelers who make their way to this far-flung corner of Bulgaria on the northward slopes of the Balkan Mountains. Known simply as the Belogradchik Rocks, they offer a sprawling display of hoodoos and anthropomorphic monoliths that’s inspired folk legends and local myths aplenty. But Belogradchik’s draws don’t end there. No sir, not with that colossal Belogradchik Fortress complex dating back to Roman times on the menu, the citadel of nearby Baba Vida and the mysterious pre-historic wall art of the Magura Cave to boot! "
Plovdiv,"Draped over seven hills along the courses of the beautiful Maritsa River, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-plovdiv-bulgaria/"">Plovdiv</a> runs the gamut of historical sights, encompassing Roman amphitheatres, Thracian fortresses, honorific monuments to Bulgaria’s own Krum the Fearsome, National Revival churches and even the occasional Soviet tenement between city limits. The piece de resistance has to be the old world historic centre though; a Game of Thrones-esque pallet of stone-clad keeps and winding alleyways, Byzantine arches and hidden squares. Oh, and Plovdiv’s nightlife beckons partiers after hours, as the coffee culture haunts turn hedonist, fuelling nights with indie, jazz and oodles of Balkan beers! "
Sunny Beach,"Throw off the inhibitions and delve into the sun-splashed party town that is <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-sunny-beach-bulgaria/"">Sunny Beach</a>. Bulgaria’s answer to Malia, Ayia Napa and Ibiza, it’s packed with thumping clubs and pubs, chatty promoters offering buckets (literally) of booze for next to nothing, flashing neon, funky ravers, booze cruises and tanned, bikini-clad, Hawaiian-shirt-wearing partiers. As well as its sleepless edge, Sunny Beach is also home to one gorgeous stretch of sand, which sits lapped over by the Black Sea and backed by the lively Boulevard, where English all-day breakfasts meet Italian pizzas in the international eateries and hotels rise in bursts of brilliant white. "
Koprivshtitsa,"Perfectly-preserved Koprivshtitsa pops up from between the spruces and pines that cover the valleys of the Sredna Gora Mountains like a beautifully adorned gingerbread carving of a town. In fact, the whole settlement is a protected national monument, supposed to reflect and define the achievements of the Bulgarian National Revival movement in its wealth of painted facades, realist stone sculptures and shuttered homes. Visitors who head to the spot today can spy out honorific memorial exhibitions dedicated to heroes of the April Uprising of 1876, while other institutions chronicle the life and works of iconic revivalist writers and artists alike. "
Perperikon,"With traces of human settlement dating back more than seven millennia and what’s been hailed as the most awesome monolithic structure in the entire Balkan Peninsula crowning its hilltops, Perperikon is a real must for any history buffs and culture vultures making their way through Bulgaria. Before it was built up and fortified by the Thracian tribespeople, it’s thought that Copper Age priests used the hill for rituals and soothsaying, which legend has it foretold the rise of both Alexander the Great and Imperial Rome under Augustus. Today, visitors can come and wander the off-the-beaten-track dig site, while relics and findings are best viewed at the local archaeology museum in Kardzhali. "
Nessebar,"Jutting out and sparkling like a Medieval Byzantine pearl between the rollers of the Black Sea, Nessebar is certainly one of the most enchanting and unforgettable cities on Bulgaria’s coast. It’s famed for an enthralling UNESCO centre where layers of Thracian ruins mix with eye-watering churches built between the 5th and 10th centuries. There are formidable fortifications too, famed for fighting off both Ottoman Turk and Crusading counts alike, not to mention rows of pretty seaside villas that cascade down neatly to meet the shore, shimmering in whitewash and red-tile as they go. Put simply – this one’s not to be missed! "
Ouagadougou,"Ouagadougou, more commonly know by the abbreviated name Ouaga, is the capital city of Burkina Faso and also the home of the country&#8217;s administration and economic centers. The architecture here is far from inspiring and the sights will leave you underwhelmed (except for the impressive Roman Catholic cathedral) but the city is a true hive of performing arts inspiration. Dance, live music, awesome festivals and craft markets make for a memorable and rewarding travel experience and make a trip to Ouaga worthwhile. "
Bobo-Dioulasso,"The city of Bobo-Dioulasso, which fortunately also has an abbreviated name; Bobo, is the second largest city in Burkina Faso. Despite its size, the city has a laid back and exclusive feel which makes it a favourite resting spot for travellers from all backgrounds and with all budgets. The city is worth exploring in the daytime but the main attraction here is the nightlife. The live music and restaurants in the city are some of the best in Burkina Faso. The local music on offer in various clubs and bars attracts the residents of the city as well as tourists from Europe and The States. "
Banfora,"Banfora is situated in one of the most beautiful regions of Burkina Faso, the Comoe Province. The town is not much of a draw for tourists in itself but the location is perfect; the nearby attractions include Tengrela Lake, which is a great place to spot hippos, especially in the dry season, and the Karfiguela Waterfalls which make for a great hiking or picnic spot. The falls have their own parking area with security for self-drive holidaymakers. "
Market in Gorom Gorom,"Gorom Gorom is a town in the north of Burkina Faso, situated at what was once an important location at the crossroads of the Sahel. The main reason to visit the town is without question the market. Each Thursday, traders from all over the country travel to sell their wares at this impressive market. It is a great place for souvenir shopping with items ranging from jewelery to handcrafted leather items. "
Tiebele,"Tiebele is a small village located right next to Burkina Faso&#8217;s border with Ghana. The Kassena people of Africa, one of the oldest ethnic groups of the country, originate from this village and as such there are a great number of traditional mud huts and other architecture all of which are beautifully decorated. The houses here, mainly due to the poverty in the area, are built entirely from straw and mud but they are decorated with character and pride, making them a great spot to visit. "
Arli National Park,"This national park, situated in southeast Burkina Faso, is one of four in Burkina Faso and is home to thousands of animals. The park occupies an area of around 700 square kilometers and species that call the park their home include lions, antelopes, monkeys and hippos. Formerly the park was home to the African wild dog although it is thought that, due to the expanding human population and other factors, the species may have been wiped out in the area. The watering hole in Tounga is one of the park&#8217;s most reliable and popular animal watching spots and draws a variety of wildlife year round. A variety of guided tours are available and are usually offered at a fair price. "
Ruins of Loropeni,"These ruins, thought to be at least 1000 years old, serve as a vivid reminder of just how vast and important the cross-Sahara gold trade once was. The site is a Unesco World Heritage site and was the first to be rewarded with such a status in the country. The stone ruins here make for a fascinating day trip and are still, at present, being excavated with many more secrets expected to be discovered with time. The nearby town of Gaoua is not really worth visiting and has a bad reputation in the country. However, if you do choose to visit the town, lookout for the sacred grove of trees and the museum. "
W National Park,"This National Park is actually shared with both Benin and Niger. The animals situated here enjoy a transition of terrain between savannah and forest and include huge flocks of migratory birds. The park is another of Burkina Faso&#8217;s Unseco World Heritage sites. Impressively, the park has also shown evidence of early neolithic settlers. Further proof of the vast diversity in the ecosystem located here. Visitors to the park must pay for 24 hours access and 4&#215;4 or trekking tours of the park are also available. "
Nazinga Reserve,"Not far from the border shared with Ghana, the Nazinga Game Reserve covers an expanse of around 97,000 hectares. If you are visiting the country for its wildlife then this reserve is a must. The elephants here steal the show although the birdlife and crocodiles are also popular. The best time to see the reserve&#8217;s elephants is between the months of December to April. There are various accommodation options in the reserve including the impressive Nazinga Ranch which occupies prime real estate by the reserve&#8217;s most lively watering hole. "
Sindou Peaks,"The lively town of Sindou is located in the Loraba Province of Burkina Faso and is mainly know for the nearby rugged rock peaks that appear suddenly from the surrounding shrubbery. The great thing about Sindou is that, although the Sindou Peaks are a genuine tourist draw, the town retains its character and charm and does not feel like a tourist spot at all. Guides are readily available in the area and reasonably priced. Be sure to visit the peaks at sunset for some good photographs and memories. "
Ouahigouya,"Ouahigouya has been the center of Mossi culture since it was founded in 1757. It is the fourth largest city in the country and attracts a fair amount of travellers from around the world. The main attractions here are the market, the street food vendors which serve variations of tasty rice and the Yatenga Chef who is the head of his faith and provides information on Mossi culture on a &#8220;pay what you wish&#8221; basis. "
Ziniare,"Ziniare is situated in the Oubritenga Province and is notable for being the birthplace of the former president of Burkina Faso; Blaise Compoare. The sites of interest to travellers in the area include the Ziniare Wildlife Park and the unusual granite sculpture which was the work of a collective group of 18 artists from 13 different countries. The animals at the Ziniare Wildlife Park include hyenas, lions, tigers, elephants and a single giraffe. The park seems to have been neglected somewhat in recent years and could do with a revamp to make it more of a tourist attraction. "
Lake Tengrela,"Although mentioned above as a nearby attraction to Banfora, this lake is worthy of its own place on this list. The hippos here are the main draw and it is thought that, due to the animals being of the sacred variety, they will not attack humans. There is a good chance of seeing hippos all year round and tours of the park are safe and usually reasonably priced. If you are lucky, you will also be able to watch local fisherman casting their nets in the lake. "
Bangr Weogo Park,This fantastic wildlife park is situated in the very heart of Ougadougou city. It has to be one of the most amazing urban parks in the world and has an impressive host of animals and plant life. The park also has a great museum detailing the natural history of the area as well as great restaurants and recreational sports and play areas. 
Sabou,"The town of Sabou is most visited for its sacred crocodiles. The crocs are seen as being harmless and remarkably no accidents involving the crocodiles have occurred here for over 70 years. If you are looking for a unique photo opportunity to impress your friends back home, the local residents here will actively encourage you to sit on one of these critters for a snap. It is forbidden to eat the crocodiles and the wellbeing of the creatures is strictly monitored by the local residents of the town. "
"Lake Tanganyika, Bujumbura","This relatively small city has not seen much development over the past decades mainly due to years of conflict in the region. The city, commonly known as Buji, has retained other characteristics from its period as a French colony such as excellent food, drink and nightlife. French cuisine can be found at various restaurants in the city, occupying a wide range of prices and quality. Sights in the city include the university which is the only one in Burundi and the Independence Monument which remembers hard times of occupation by French, Belgian and German rulers. The Living Museum is also located in Bujumbura and is arguably one of the best museums of its kind in Africa. It shows ancient and modern crafts used in Burundi. "
Rusizi River National Park,"Located just outside of Bujumbura is the fascinating Rusizi River National Park. The plains surrounding the river are flooded periodically, bringing hundreds of animals to the area for his vital lifesource. Hippos are just one of the many animals to frequent the area and are one of the most sought after by tourists. The park, with its clear skies, is a true bird-watchers paradise. The migratory birds that visit the park include rare and beautiful species from both Asia and Europe such as sand pipers and plovers. "
Ruvubu National Park,"The Ruvubu National Park is the largest in Burundi and covers an area of over 500 square kilometers. The park, which was founded in 1980, is home to some of the most majestic and impressive wildlife in the country including beasts such as hippos, buffalo and crocodiles. The park is also known for its variety of rare plants and flowers as well as the birdlife that migrates to the region throughout the year. Preservation of the park is one of the country&#8217;s top concerns, so much so that humans have been evacuated from the area. The park is well equipped for camping and is easily accessible by road. "
Lake Rwihinda Natural Reserve,"Another hotspot for an amazing variety of flora and fauna and another top attraction for tourists in Burundi. The reserve covers an area of over 8,000 hectares consisting of a mix of shrubland, forest and grassland. The lake is another place that birdwatchers will adore. The amount of rare and stunning birds that visit this lake is too many to mention. Agriculture and decreasing water levels are having an impact on the reserve despite preservation efforts. For now though the reserve remains a must-visit destination for travellers in Burundi. "
Kibira National Park,"The Kibira National Park lies within a fascinating location between 1,500m and 2,600m in altitude. The park is largely occupied by primeval rainforest and was once used as a sacred hunting ground by the country&#8217;s former kings. Today however, it is another of Burundi&#8217;s protected areas where vast amounts and varieties of wildlife make their homes. The forest, and the rivers and streams that flow through it, support animals such as baboons, chimps and more than 200 kinds of bird species. The park is commonly visited by tourists who first pass through the large tea plantations in Teza; these are an attraction in their own right. "
Kigwena Natural Forest,"The Kigwena Natural Forest is conveniently located on the National Route no.3 in the Rumonge commune of Burundi and covers an area of more than 3,000 hectares. The forest here is dense and it feels like an adventure just to step foot in. Inhabiting the forest are a number of baboons, monkeys and various species of butterflies and birds. A guided tour of the forest is available through the country&#8217;s Environmental and Conservation Institute. "
Gitega,"This city, which is now Burundi&#8217;s second city, was the country&#8217;s capital during colonial times. The city has a number of worthwhile attractions including the remarkable Gitega National Museum which has a vast collection of artifacts and antiquities from Burundi&#8217;s past. The city is well equipped for tourists and has a decent range of accommodation options for most budgets. The city is commonly included on safari tours as an overnight stop. "
"Gishora, Drummers","7km away from Gitega, Gishora sits proudly atop a hill chosen for its strategic position by King Gisabo. The main sight in Gishora, and another common stopoff for safari tours, is the drum sanctuary. The drums have played an important role throughout the history of Burundi and were often made for, and played at, important events such as royal ceremonies. The sanctuary is a great way to experience this aspect of Burundi culture as well as the architecture of a royal palace which is recreated here. "
Mount Heha,"The highest mountain in Burundi, Mount Heha is part of the Burundi Highlands mountain range. The mountain is popular for trekking and at  2,864m it makes a good challenge for anyone looking to summit. The mountain is located fairly close to Bujumbura and this is the most convenient location to use as a base before setting out to climb the mountain. "
Saga Beach,"Whoever thought a country needed a coastline for great beaches can be proven wrong with a trip to Saga (pronounced sagga) Beach in Burundi. The beach, which is part of the shore of Lake Tanganyika, may not be a sandy white beach from the Mediterranean but it is a great place to take a dip and enjoy the warm waters of the lake. The beach is easily accessible and is located only a few kilometers away from the capital. The best time to visit the beach is at the weekend when the crowd of locals ensure that the atmosphere is lively and fun. "
Source du Nil,"Although it is debated whether it is in fact the true source of the Nile (in fact there is no one source but many) this natural landmark is still worth a visit. What looks like a rather insignificant spring over 100km from the capital, is most probably the southernmost source of the Nile river. The spring is made more obvious by the stone pyramids that mark its location. Getting here is impossible without either your own method of transport or a local guide willing to take you. A further half an hours drive will take you to the hot springs south of the Source du Nil. "
Chutes de la Kerera,"The Chutes near Rutana consist of four beautiful falls. The fall nearest to the car park is actually the prettiest but this should not stop you from walking around and seeing the others. Walking upstream is possible and a quick shower to cool off is possible in the smallest of the four waterfalls. The tallest waterfall and the areas namesake is the Kerera Fall which is especially fearsome in the height of the wet season. There are no public transport options to the falls so a visit needs to be arranged by a chartered vehicle, as part of a tour, or of course self-drive is an option. "
Vyanda Natural Reserve,"Another of Burundi&#8217;s natural reserves, the Vyanda reserve can be easily accessed by the town of Rumonge which is nearby. The reserve is not particularly well equipped for tourists but a visit is possible with some forward planning and contact. There are usually two prices for guided tours; the full price and a reduced fee if your guide fails to show you any of the chimps in residence here. It is also worth noting that the chimps are fully wild and not accustomed to close encounters with humans so don&#8217;t expect the sort of photo-oppurtunities that some of Africa&#8217;s other reserves offer. "
Bururi Nature Reserve,
"Yosemite Falls, Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Falls are popular with visitors from around the world. Much of the water that crashes down the falls and into the lake below comes from snowmelt. Yosemite falls itself is the fifth highest waterfall in the world and from top to bottom it is 2,425 feet. The falls are at their most spectacular in May and June, once the snow has melted the falls become a trickle and you then need to wait for the cooler weather again. "
Sturtevant Falls In The Angeles National Forest,Sturtevant Falls are located in the foothills of the Angeles National Forest. The falls themselves are fifty foot in height and look exceptionally beautiful due to the moss and algae that grows on the cliff. This makes the colours you see as the water runs distinctive and mesmerizing. 
California’s Pacific Coast Highway,The Pacific Coast Highway in California is one of the most beautiful drives there is. It runs along most of the coastline of California and is famous across the world for its beautiful scenery. The route is a designated blue Star Memorial Highway as a way of recognition to those that serve in the U.S. armed forces. 
"Santa Cruz, California","Santa Cruz is one of the surfing mecca’s of the United States. The city itself is only small with a population of approximately 50,000 but the beautiful beaches and bohemian vibe attracts many visitors from across the world. The all year summer feel adds to the feeling of never ending paradise that you will always feel in this city. "
Joshua Tree National Park,"Joshua Tree National Park is named this because of the Joshua trees that are native to the park. The area is a designated wilderness and encompasses two very different deserts. Visitors to the park can experience camping, hiking, and climbing. "
California Street Cable Car,The California Street Cable Car is the last manually operated cable car system left in the world. It is an icon of San Francisco and during its peak there were twenty three lines running through the city. Now there are just three remaining and they make for a beautiful view when you are visiting the city. 
Pfeiffer Beach,"Pfeiffer Beach is a quiet, beautiful and unusual beach. The locals visit the area regularly but to the tourist the beach is still fairly unknown. The sand at the beach is an unusual purple colour and this is caused by the manganese garnet particles that get washed down from the neighbouring hillside. "
San Diego,Along the coast of the Pacific Ocean is the vibrant and gorgeous city of San Diego. There are plenty of beautiful beaches to explore which when tempered with the mild climate of the area make this a fantastic place to visit. San Diego has the nickname “America’s Finest City” which should say it all really. 
Lava Beds National Monument,There are 25 lava tube caves that you can visit when you are in Tuelake. When you climb down into the caves it will be like nothing you have experienced before. The caves have tubes that are made out of lava and a visitor center that explains their creation. 
Big Sur,Big Sur was derived from the Spanish words ‘el sure grande’ which means ‘the big south’. The area is lightly populated and sits at the south of the city of Monterey. There are some stunning views to be had whilst you are in this small area which makes it very popular with tourists. 
McWay Falls,McWay falls is an 80 foot waterfall that is located in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. The fall is actually classed as tide fall due to its close proximity to the ocean. The waterfall used to flow directly into the ocean but following a landslide in 1985 the terrain was altered and it now flows into an inaccessible beach. 
San Francisco &#8211; View From Twin Peaks,"San Francisco is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and is famous for the stunning Golden Gate Bridge, colourful houses from the Victorian age and the last remaining cable cars. The city has many huge skyscrapers that make for a beautiful view. Just off the coast is Alcatraz Island which was home to the famous prison. "
Vernal Falls,In the Yosemite National Park you will come across Vernal Falls. A 317 foot water fall that falls into the Merced River. The falls run all year round but at certain points of the year they break into multiple strands when the volume of water decreases. 
Monterey Beach,Monterey Beaches are made up of a selection of Beaches that range from tiny little jewels to large area of sand. Each beach is unique and offers plenty of recreation facilities from kayaking to surfing to diving. 
Emerald Bay,Emerald Bay is a small island that sits within Lake Tahoe. The bay has now been designated a National Natural Landmark due to the natural beauty that this small island provides. There are two camping grounds and a scenic foot trail that goes around the outside of the island. 
Muir Woods National Monument,Muir Woods is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and a hot spot for tree lovers. The forest is often covered in a fog that comes from the coast. There are countless redwood trees growing in the area that use the fog that seeps in to stay moist during the dry summers. 
Napa Valley,In the north of California you will find the Napa Valley. The area is famous for its beautiful landscapes and legendary wineries. The area is perfect for those that want to get away from it all and pamper themselves for a few days in the award winning restaurants and spas. 
Cathedral Peak,Cathedral Peak is one part of the mountain range known as the Cathedral Range. The peak got its name because of the shape of the peak that looks like a cathedral. Glacial activity formed the peak and it has remained in its current form for many years. 
Mariposa Woods,Mariposa Woods are a grove of giant sequoias. When you arrive you will feel like you are in a fairy-tale as the trees get taller and taller the further in you go. Some of the trees are between 1900 and 2400 years old with the star of the show being the giant sequoia named ‘Grizzly Giant’ 
Giant Rock In Landers,"The Giant Rock is a real natural beauty and one that you must see whilst on a trip to landers. The boulder is in the Mojave Desert and covers an area of 5,800 square feet. The rock is seven stories high and known to be the largest free standing rock in the world. "
"Glacier Point, Yosemite","Situated well above the Yosemite Valley is Glacier Point. A viewpoint that stands at an elevation of 7,214 feet. From here you can stand back and catch amazing views of the Yosemite Valley, Vernal Fall, Clouds Rest and Nevada Fall. "
California One Highway,Running from San Diego to San Francisco is the California One Highway. One of the most celebrated driving roads in the world. You will travel through wine country and beaches along this winding coastal drive. An absolute must for anyone who loves a road trip. 
Big Basin Redwoods State Park,"Big Basin Redwoods State Park is the oldest State Park in the country and here is where you will find the Waddell Creek Watershed. This area was formed when the rim was uplifted and the centre eroded, leaving the beautiful bowl shaped area you can see today. "
Humboldt Redwoods State Park,Inside Humboldt Redwoods State Park you will find Rockefeller Forest which is the largest contiguous forest of coast redwoods in the world. Many of these trees grow to over 91 metres in height and the ‘Stratosphere Giant’ was at one point the tallest redwood known to man. 
Mendocino Coast,Mendocino Coast is a nature lover’s paradise. With breath taking scenery and rock formations that have been carved by the wind. There are tide pools and secret coves to explore as well as wetlands filled with birds and other wildlife. A truly fantastic place to explore when you need to get everything. 
"Bishop, California","Bishop in California is a small town that offers much to the person who loves the great outdoors. You can trek to the top of White Mountain Peak which is 14,246 feet at its altitude and offers stunning views of the landscape below. "
"Oxnard, Ventura County, California",Oxnard is a small city in California that has many beautiful beaches and dunes to visit. You can enjoy quiet beaches that let you take in beautiful sunsets or you can choose to walk along the dunes for an equally stunning view. 
"China Beach, San Francisco","In the Sea Cliff neighbourhood of San Francisco is China Beach, a small cove that is one of the cleanest and most looked after beaches in the state. The cove was originally used as a campsite for Chinese fisherman that worked in and the bay. "
Angkor Wat,"The home of the famous Angkor Wat is unquestionably one of Cambodia&#8217;s must-see places. Unfortunately, thanks to the legendary pagodas and vine-dressed stupas that are tagged by UNESCO, it&#8217;s also one of the busiest spots in the country. Still, it&#8217;s definitely worth braving the crowds and hopping out of Siem Reap for a spell to see this world wonder. Encompassed by wetland rice paddies and dense jungles, it emerges from the canopy in a medley of historic Khmer towers and enchanting erstwhile Hindu shrines. Today, it&#8217;s the chants of Buddhist monks and gasping travelers that dominates, as they weave between the intricate base reliefs and the great sandstone sculptures of mythic beasts. "
Sihanoukville,"Sihanoukville is Cambodia&#8217;s answer to the backpacker beach towns of Thailand just across the gulf. A ramshackle place of tin-roofed hostels and bamboo beer bars spilling onto the sands, it oozes a laid-back vibe that&#8217;s a welcome break from the country&#8217;s other urban centers. The beaches are the place to be both day and night, with the establishments of Ochheuteal offering loungers and water sports aplenty. For something a little quieter, you could also make a beeline around the headlands to less-trodden Otres Beach, or pay the entry fee for secluded Sokha Beach nearby. "
Royal Palace,"Phnom Penh is a city in flux: a place where barrios of haphazard shack homes mingle with gilded temples of gold leaf and straight-laced highways of the 21st century. That means it&#8217;s also a fine spot to get to grips with the nature of Cambodia as a whole; a country neatly balanced between the old and the new. The piece de resistance is surely the opulent Royal Palace complex, which shimmers with the spires of the Silver Pagoda at its center. For a taste of local life, be sure to hit the buzzing Sisowath Quay, which runs along the Mekong in a medley of markets and picnic spots. And – of course – there are the so-called Killing Fields just on the edge of town: sobering and stark reminders of the horrors of Cambodia&#8217;s 20th-century past. "
Kratie,"Defined by the meanders of the Mekong River as it gushes towards the delta and the South China Sea in the south-east, this laid-back spot is slowly but surely raising itself to become one of Cambodia&#8217;s bona fide backpacker hubs. It&#8217;s easy to see why the shoestring travelers love it too – think cheap timber longhouses and earthy guesthouses, really old ruins at Sambor and traditional craft markets on the water. But that&#8217;s not all, because Kratie has also become famed as one of the top places to see the Cambodian river dolphin. Excursions to stalk these majestic mammals in the Mekong leave from the docks every day. "
Cambodia War Museum,"It&#8217;s true that most people flock to Siem Reap to hop across to the UNESCO wonder of Ankgor Wat. However, thanks largely to the influx of folk coming in recent decades, this one has developed into a fine place to visit in its own right. You can delve into an old town of elegant French mansions and enchanting Chinese shops, all of which are punctuated by the heady fray of Psah Chas market (perfect for sizzling noodle soups!) and countless backpacker bars (look for appropriately-named Pub Street). There are also some really great museums in Siem Reap, like the sobering Cambodia Landmine Museum and the (equally sobering) War Museum Cambodia. "
Koh Ker,"Koh Ker is the smaller, lesser-known brother of Angkor Wat. Located deep in the jungles of northern Cambodia, the spot reigned as the capital of the mighty Khmer Empire for a measly 20 years. However, those two decades of glory still show, with elaborate stupas protruding from the canopies and the 1,000-year-old rises of the stepped Prasat Thom temples soaring more than 30 meters above the ground. You&#8217;ll also be able to see an elaborate array of fortifications dating from the 10th century, and crumbling ruins of shrines now almost entirely claimed by the roots of giant teak trees. In short: this one&#8217;s a fine alternative to bustling Angkor. "
Koh Rong,"This eight-shaped island that sits out where the waters of the Thai Gulf meet the South China Sea is a picture of tropical perfection. It boasts a whopping 23 individual stretches of sand, all of which are far quieter and untouched than their compadres across the straits in Sihanoukville. Rustic, salt-sprayed bungalows line the coast sporadically, and there are plenty of opportunities for trekking through the forests, or hitting the coral-colored sea for a bout of snorkeling. Koh Rong is also famed for its bioluminescent waters, which glimmer under the dark skies at night – you&#8217;ll spot them if you aren’t too busy guzzling beers in nearby Koh Tuch Village! "
Banlung,"The provincial capital of Ratanakiri is hardly on the tourist radar at all – at least for the moment, that is. Slowly but surely, more and more adventure seekers and outdoorsy types are waxing down the walking boots and heading to this remote corner of the country, where macaques meet slinking snakes between the jungle canopies. The town itself might be a dusty, hectic affair, but there are plenty of tour organizers there who can put together trips out to the beautiful Yeak Laom Volcanic Lake, the colossal cataract of Cha Ong, or the sweeping rubber plantations that surround the province. "
"Colonial houses, Kampot","Kampot might seem tantalizingly close to the coast for it not to be about beaches, but this river town on the delta waters of the Praek Tuek Chhu offers something totally different than just sand, sea and sun. Start with a trip to the pepper farms that blanket the local flatlands – they are not only the primary economic driver here, but also responsible for the unique peppercorns of Kampot. The town is also home to a series of earthy fishing villages, where seafood fries come doused in chili and lemongrass. And then there&#8217;s the array of dilapidating colonial builds in the center, along with the rusting shells of old locomotives in the Kampot railway station. "
Mondulkiri,"Asian elephants stalk the fields and bushlands of far-flung Mondulkiri Province; water buffalo and timber longhouses ring the wetlands, as peaks of forest-clad rock rise to meet the border with Vietnam. This eastern jewel is a far cry from the sun-scorched lands and steamy tropical climes that dominate the rest of the country, and is slowly becoming famed for its second-to-none elephant conservation project. Cultural encounters with the earthy Bunong tribespeople are also possible, and ecotourism of that sort is now the main driver here. "
Battambang,"Statue-dotted Battambang is perhaps something of an unusual favorite on the backpacking circuit around Cambodia. Why? Well, there&#8217;s not really all that much to see in the town itself, and the temples hardly live up to the majesty of Siem Reap. Still, folk continue to flock to this second city, and we&#8217;re hardly complaining. Lively traveler bars line the streets and there are some great hotels to choose from, all of which hide between the occasional Buddhist temple and the throbbing Central Market. Around Battambang is where you&#8217;ll find the Wat Baydamram (filled with fruit bats) and the eerie Wat Samraong Knong, which was once used as a Khmer Rouge prison! "
Kep,"Poor little Kep is just a shadow of the jet setter resort for Cambodian dignitaries it was in the early 20th century. Yep, decades of war and Khmer Rouge destruction took its toll on the country&#8217;s top seaside retreat, and today remnants of that dark age can still be seen in the form of ruined villas and burned out hotels along the shore. However, Kep is rebounding, and today the pretty stretches of powdery yellow sand along the Kep Peninsula are alive once more with seafood restaurants and bars. Oh, and don&#8217;t leave without sampling the famous Kep crab – one of Cambodia&#8217;s most legendary staples! "
Koh Thonsay,"Rabbit Island (as it&#8217;s known in English) is one of the jewels of Kep Province, set just out in the waters of the Thai Gulf from the southern coast of the country. Fringed with softly sloping yellow sands and rows of swaying coconut palms, it&#8217;s got all the tropical beauties you&#8217;d expect from a tropical island. However, Koh Thonsay also comes with far fewer crowds than its compadres across the waters in the Land of Smiles, and the prices are cheaper too! The best thing to do is strap on the walking boots and hike the coastal trails. Sooner or later you&#8217;ll discover a secluded cove of shimmering shore waters, totally empty save for the occasional bobbing fishing skiff. "
Cardamom Mountains Rainforest,"The rugged, salt-sprayed rocks of the Koh Kong coast mark the point where the primeval woods of the Cardamom Mountains Rainforest cascade down to meet the Indian Ocean. Undeveloped and untouched by the onset of modern tourism, the place remains a picture of wild Southeast Asia. A smattering of casinos and sleazy massage parlors do still linger on from the days when Krong was a smuggler passage town on the Thai border, but the real pulls are surely the gushing waterfalls, the wild jungles, and – of course – the legendary white-sand beaches of Koh Krong Island. "
Pailin,"Pailin can be found deep in the Cardamom Mountains of western Cambodia. Surrounded by hills of green bush and dominated by the serrated tips of the high hills on the horizon, it was once known as the prime gem mining center of the country. Consequently, it was a hot point of conflict during the years of the Khmer Rouge in the last century, and there&#8217;s something of a dark history to unravel here. Today the place is pleasantly walkable and sleepy though, with good access to the wild and untrodden Roneam Daun Sam Wildlife, and a series of lookout pagodas and waterfalls on the menu to boot. "
"Cambridge, England","The University of Cambridge has a worldwide reputation for excellence, and, having been founded in 1209, is the second oldest in the English-speaking world. The university&#8217;s various colleges like Kings&#8217;, Queens&#8217;, Trinity and St Catherine&#8217;s  are integral to a visit to the city with stunning architecture from different periods. Punting along the &#8220;Backs&#8221;, where several college buildings back onto the River Cam is one of several must-dos. Another, if you have time, is the sensational Fitzwilliam Museum, with a Henry Moore sculpture in its grounds and a trove of painting from the Dutch, English, Flemish, French and Italian Schools. Rubens is especially well-represented, with 14 paintings. "
Ely Cathedral,"It&#8217;s fun to wonder what a bewildering sight Ely must have been in the middle ages: A resplendent cathedral isolated in the marshes on a lone chalk hill. This incredible monument still has the power to catch your breath and commands the landscape for what seems like miles. There&#8217;s a blend of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in the design, feted for its octagonal tower, which is as beautiful outside as it is when you stand in the interior and gaze up from underneath. Olive Cromwell lived in Ely from 1636-47 and his half-timbered house at St Mary&#8217;s Vicarage will tell you about his time in the city, as well as the compelling history of the Fens. "
Huntingdon,"This town is as cute as they come, but has a history that will excite the antiquarian in all of us. Huntingdon got its charter from King John at the start of the 13th century. Follow the &#8220;Historic Trail&#8221; around the centre to see the medieval bridge over the River Ouse and coaching houses from the 1700s when Huntingdon was an important cog in England&#8217;s horse-drawn transport network. But the main reason to come to Huntingdon is for Oliver Cromwell, who was born in the town in 1599 and later became its MP. Get some perspective on this divisive figure at the Cromwell Museum, which has a sumptuous venue in a medieval school house that the 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys also attended. "
"St Ives, Cambridgeshire","From medieval times onwards St Ives thrived because of the trade afforded by the River Great Ouse and thanks to its road transport connections to London. At one time in the 1830s there were 64 pubs in this town. You can still experience some of the former bustle at the markets on Mondays and Fridays that occupy most of the town centre. St Ives Bridge, constructed in the 1400s, is one of only four bridges in the county to come with a chapel. In the 1500s the prior from the dissolved St Ives abbey was permitted to live here. The Old Riverport by the bridge is also where you can embark on a guided cruise on the river and to see the pleasing greenery of the water meadows in the Ouse Valley. "
"St Wendreda&#8217;s Church, March","The highlight of this market town is the Church of St Wendreda. And specifically it&#8217;s the interior you need to see, which has a 14th-century double hammerbeam roof with the images of 120 angels carved into the wood. In the Fens to the northeast of the county, March was actually once an island until the surrounding marshes were drained, and this helped the town develop from the 1600s on. The River Nene, now very charming, became navigable, and was used for trading grain and coal, and the town was granted its market. This is still in rude health and trades in front of the neo-gothic town hall on Wednesdays and Saturdays. "
Wisbech,Further downstream on the Nene is Cambridgeshire&#8217;s second largest town. Like March Wisbech&#8217;s fortune&#8217;s changed as soon as the Fens were drained because overnight it became a crucial inland port shipping produce from the Fens&#8217; new farmland. The Nene Quay and the North and South Brinks are a stunning testament to this period and one of Cambridgeshire most agreeable man-made sights. On either side of the Nene are rows of 17th and 18th century warehouses and tall houses that now have a stately air but would have been bustling before the railways came. On the grand Museum Square is the Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum in a handsome townhouse and has been open since 1847. 
Peterborough,"A prosperous city on the edge of the Fens and known for its manufacturing and commerce, Peterborough is often neglected by tourists. But there&#8217;s a great deal to discover if you give it a chance, with the added bonus the shopping and dining of an urban centre. The most obvious landmark is the cathedral, which shines for being one of just a handful of 12th-century early-Gothic churches to be largely unchanged since it was first completed. Lovers of medieval architecture may lose all track of time in this monument. Bronze Age discoveries are made around Peterborough all the time, and, just east of the city centre, Flag Fen is a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age site cleverly presented as a museum. "
"Ramsey, Cambridgeshire","Despite being compact, the town of Ramsey has 60 listed buildings in a historic centre designated as a conservation area. Branching off the High Street is Great Whyte, and the curious thing about this street is that it has large dock warehouses at the top end even though there&#8217;s no sign of a river. That&#8217;s because the High Lode River channelled under Great Whyte in the 1850s, which is the reason for the distinctive width of the street. The highly-rated Ramsey Rural Museum sheds light on the early years of farming the reclaimed Fens and is even contained in beautiful farm buildings that date to 1600s. "
Imperial War Museum Duxford,"In the far south of Cambridgeshire is this village most famous for its airfield. In the Second World War RAF Duxford was a key base during the Battle of Britain and then for the United States Air Force. Since the 70s it has been redeveloped as a visitor attraction, and has a staggering collection of vintage aircraft at what is now the Imperial War Museum Duxford. There are 200 aircraft and all kinds of other military vehicles in seven buildings. You could stop for lunch at one of the three pubs in the village and then go and investigate St John&#8217;s Church, which has Gothic frescos and walls that are etched with historic graffiti. "
St Neots,"Many visitors may arrive in St Neots in an unconventional way, by barge along the River Great Ouse, which is one of the UK&#8217;s longest rivers, flowing across eastern England and emptying into the North Sea. The riverbanks could well be the most agreeable part of the town, as there&#8217;s a riverside park where you can see the waterborne traffic floating by in the summer. Nothing beats a quirky local museum, and the one in St Neots ticks this box, being housed in the town&#8217;s former magistrates court. This attraction will relate some interesting tales about the people who used to live in the town, like the Eynesbury Giant , who lived in St Neots in the 1800s. "
Anglesey Abbey,"A loveable village northwest of Cambridge, Lode has sweet little thatched cottages and grander flat-fronted homes, and is great for walks in the southern Fens. But there&#8217;s some inspiring history in Lode&#8217;s back garden too: Anglesey Abbey is a marvellous 17th-century Jacobean manor house. The property is crammed with paintings, antique furniture, clocks and silverware belonging to Lord Fairhaven, who bequeathed it all to the National Trust. The landscaped grounds surpass even the manor house, and have year-round appeal thanks to the snowdrops that bloom in February. Last but not least there&#8217;s Lode Mill, a watermill from the 1700s, still milling grain and open to the public. "
Buckden Towers,"One of the many things to love about the village of Buckden is how its high street is still a cornerstone of the community. There are boutiques, restaurants and inns all clustered together, and at the George Hotel &amp; Brasserie you&#8217;ll realise how Buckden was once a staging town on the Great North Road, which linked London with Edinburgh. And it&#8217;s not every high street that can claim to have entertained royalty. Buckden Towers first went up in the 1100s, and the design that you see now is Tudor. A host of the medieval and Tudor England&#8217;s most significant figures stayed here, like Edward I (Longshanks in Braveheart!), Richard III and Henry VIII, as well as his wives Catherine of Aragon and Catherine Howard. "
Yaounde,"West Africa may not be known for beautiful cities but Cameroon&#8217;s capital Yaounde certainly is one. The city is immaculately planned to be spread over seven hills meaning that the numerous buildings in the city are separated by stretches of lush green and rising terrain. In addition to its layout, the city is clean and safe with plenty of points of interest. The 1970&#8217;s government buildings here will appeal to culture buffs and are unusual looking to say the least. Given the central location of Yaounde it is also a perfect city to include in any tour of the country. "
Maroua,"Nowhere near as lush and green, Maroua still has an appeal of its own. The streets are remarkably red, sandy and dusty and the buildings are a dull beige colour but the colours of the locals clothing brings plenty of colour to the city. Maroua is a great place to experience the culture of Cameroon and its bustling markets are some of the best in the country. The city is also a great base for travllers wishing to visit the Mandara Mountains in the north of the country. "
Limbe,"Occupying the slopes of Mount Cameroon, an active volcanic mountain, Limbe is a city that acts as a great base for travellers who are looking to explore the beauty of the area. The botanical gardens in the city are a great place to learn about the nature and plants in the area before exploring the nearby waterfalls and national park. The mountain itself has a summit height of over 4,000m and is therefore a serious challenge but walks for novices are still possible around the base of the mountain without making a full ascent. If you are a lover of nature and wildlife then this is the place for you in Cameroon. "
Douala,"Douala has a reputation for being a bit grimey and insalubrious but this should not put you off visiting. This is the major city in Cameroon in most aspects; the airport is the biggest in the country, as is the port and the business centre here is the main one in the country. All of these hubs result in a chaotic and overactive feel and it is likely that you will not relax much whilst you are here. With that being said however the city is a great place to witness modern Cameroon and the few charms it offers. "
Waza National Park,"About 180 miles to the north of Maroua is Waza National Park. This park looks very different during the four seasons but is always a good place to witness some of the country&#8217;s most spectacular wildlife including elephants, giraffes and hyenas. Self-drive vehicles are allowed to explore the park but you will need a guide. This is not necarasilly a bad thing as you are much more likely to see the wildlife with a local guide that knows their stuff. "
Bamenda,"Bamenda holds the title of being the capital of Cameroon&#8217;s north-west and is a large city with all the amenities and facilities needed by travellers. The city of Bamenda is not likely to keep you interested for more than a day or two but Bamenda is a great place to reach the country&#8217;s highlands which offer beautiful lush scenery and hidden villages. The surrounding landscape is a great place for mountain biking, hiking and finding some off the radar guesthouses and restaurants. "
Foumban Palace,"For art lovers, Foumban is a must-see city in Cameroon. The city has its roots in arts, music and architecture. It is also the city in Cameroon with the largest Muslim population. The city is much like a blend of North and West Africa with its Islamic influences. The Royal Palace and its adjoining museum is the main attraction here although the city&#8217;s mosque is also worth a visit while you are here. "
Bafoussam,"Although at first glance this city can seem busy and uninspiring, it will reward those who choose to explore. The people here are very friendly and welcoming to tourists and the palace here is a great, if not the best, example of a Royal Palace in Cameroon. The accommodation in the city is affordable and there are some true hidden gems to be found. The main tourist attraction is the tribal museum in the city which is part of the &#8220;Four Museums of Cameroon&#8221; project. "
Kribi,"This is the home of paradise in Cameroon. The beaches here are stunning with white sand, blue sea and fresh fish served from the restaurants lining the seafront. There are plenty of hotels in the Kribi area and most are reasonably priced. If after lounging by the beach all day you are looking for something different to do, the Chutes de la Lobe waterfalls are just 8km due south from the town. The waterfalls cascade directly into the sea forming a truly memorable sight. "
Korup National Park,"Korup National Park is a vast area, comprising 126,000 hectares of evergreen forest. The park is well maintained with resident scientists and well-marked trails. Many species of birds can be found in the park including hornbills and the extremely rare red headed rockfowl.  Visitors to the park may even be lucky enough to see elephants or chimps although these are rare. The road access to the park can be tricky especially in the wet months when the road conditions deteriorate. It is worth noting that the Chimpanzee camp is a 7 mile hike from the Mana foot bridge, so come prepared. "
Dja Faunal Reserve,"The Dja Faunal Reserve is one of the largest areas of protected rainforest in Africa. 90% of the reserve consists of unspoiled and protected forest marked out by the Dja River which acts as a natural border for the area. The reserve is home to 107 mammals including a large variety of primates, for which the reserve is best known. The area is not too easy to access and a local guide is advisable. "
Mefou National Park,Mefou is a project run by volunteers just outside of Yaounde. The park is a rehabilitation centre for apes including chimps and gorillas. The staff at the national park are very helpful and can arrange a guided tour of the facilities if requested. The park is easily reached if you have your own vehicle. Just be sure to take enough food and drink for the day as the park&#8217;s facilities are limited in this respect. 
Dschang,"This city, located in the West province of Cameroon, is growing quickly and the population has increased tenfold in the past 20 years. The main attractions in the city are the Museum of Civilization, which explores the history of Cameroon through its tribes and cultures, and the Center le Cinematique which, as it sounds is a museum centered around film. The latter of these two attractions seems to have been neglected in recent years but the Museum of Civilization is still a great learning experience for visitors to Cameroon. "
Garoua,"Garoua, the capital of the North, is located on the banks of the Benue River. The city is a hive of industry and thrives as a river port exporting everything from petroleum to animal hides. Several game reserves in the area mean that tourists often stay within Garoua and use the city as a base. The city itself has few attractions but does have amenities, guesthouses and restaurants making it a worthy place to stay when visiting the local game reserves. "
Campo Ma&#8217;an National Park,"This massive national park covers an area of 264,000 hectares. The landscapes confined within this massive area are as diverse as you would expect. From mountains to rainforest, the diverse landscape is home to mammals, birds and even sea turtles which make their nests on the beaches here. Having your own vehicle is the best way to see the area and the few basic hostels in the park are fine for a few nights stay. In total, there are more than 80 species of mammals at the park and more than 300 bird species pop up here throughout the year. The National Park is funded by the WWF and is supported further by timber and palm oil plantations in the area. "

Located in the southwest of the country, far away from the troubles in the centre of the country and Sudan, Berberati is probably one of the safest places to visit in the country at this troubled time and is a good base for visitors to the nearby Dzangha-Sanga Nature Reserve. Whilst in the area it is worth looking at the history left behind by the various occupants throughout the past such as the French military. "
Tikal,"These ancient cities of the Maya people are testimony to the rich civilization that dominated the region between 700 BC and 900 AD. While Maya ruins are scattered throughout the country, Tikal and Copan are the two major sites that remain intact. The “Great Plaza” of Tikal is the most impressive structure, located centrally between ornate altars, ceremonial buildings, lavish dwellings, and the infamous ball court. Fun fact: the ball games in ancient Maya times are thought to be the first sport throughout all of human history, dating back to 2500 BC. Archeologists have found ancient ball courts, like the one in Tikal, as far north as Arizona all the way down to Nicaragua and even in Cuba. Though ancient native populations played the game for fun, it was also taken very seriously for ritual events and in disputes between communities (sounds kind of like soccer in modern-day Latin America). Under these circumstances, the captain of the losing team would often be executed or sacrificed. "
Lake Atitlan,"This lake formed as a result of a volcanic explosion 85,000 years ago that spread volcanic ash all the way up to Florida. The pressure from the volcano’s magma forced the surface ground to collapse, forming a hollow circle that soon filled up with water. Today, the breathtaking site is home to small quaint villages and is an ideal stopping point for any backpacker. This location is more for relaxation and taking a breather from all the adventure than it is for partying. You can take in the serene beauty of the lake and volcanos by kayaking, hiking, biking, jet skiing, swimming, boating, or taking a cultural tour through the surrounding indigenous villages. "
Dominical,"This beach town is a surfer’s dream. With consistent ten-feet-high waves, hardly anyone does anything else. But there are other options aside from taking surfing lessons from one of the countless surfing companies along the shore. Dominical has gorgeous rainforests, waterfalls, and caves where you can go zip lining, horseback riding, hiking, enjoy a massage or even a yoga session. You can also see whales 9 months out of the year. There are whale watching tours where you can see the only place in the Western Hemisphere where whales from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meet. This beach town is a perfect place to lay back in a hammock and relax off the beaten trail—since there are no paved roads, chain restaurants, or significant cultural sites here. "
Corcovado &#8211; Bird,"National Geographic called Corcovado National Park the “most biologically intense place on Earth,” and they were definitely onto something. It’s the crown jewel of Costa Rica’s national parks, with 103,290 acres of tropical rainforest, and home to 500 species of trees, 6,000 species of insects, 140 species of mammals, 400 species of birds, 116 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 40 species of fish. There are also jaguars, sea turtles, sloths, and many species of monkeys. So if you want to hike up your sleeves and explore the wildlife of the incredible Central American rainforests, you surely can’t miss Corcovado! "
San Blas Island,"Lonely Planet named San Blas the #3 tropical paradise in the world in 2011. This heavenly place of 365 islands is exactly what you picture when you think tropical paradise: white sand, crystal-clear waters, palm trees, and isolation. Thanks to the Guna indigenous group who owns this region, big business and commercialization hasn’t been allowed in. They have preserved the natural environment in all of its glory. You won’t find any concrete, sky scrapers, or even wifi in this part of Panama, and it is bliss if you’re really trying to escape from reality for a few days (or weeks or years…you might just want to move there). All the islands are very accessible to each other, so you can hop from one to the other by boat and enjoy sun bathing, snorkeling, kayaking, or sailing. The Guna people are also very friendly, and happily offer tours of their villages to tourists. You can explore their peaceful way of life that seems like it’s stuck in time, walking through their bamboo houses and swinging hammocks, all tucked in between the rainforest, waterfalls, and impeccable beaches. "
Boquete,"Don’t forget to stop by this quiet mountain town deemed “The Land of Eternal Springtime. ” It contains the best known U.S. expat community in the world, so you can have fun and take a mental break from working on your Spanish skills. Because of the many Americans in the area, you can find anything between hostels to luxury hotels with health spas. In Boquete, you can go whitewater rafting, zip lining, rock climbing, enjoy the natural hot springs, go on an adventurous safari tour, visit the famous coffee plantations the region is known for, or visit the Baru Volcano, one of the only places in the world where you can see both the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean at the same time. "
León – Nicaragua,"Discover the thriving college town of León, one of Nicaragua’s oldest cities, and the country’s political and cultural center. León remains one of Central American’s main attractions for students as backpackers, as the city is draped in Spanish colonial architecture and pulsates with museums, art centers, public murals, and historic churches. Savor the authentic flavors of Nicaragua’s local favorites: fried cheese, plantains, and the quintessential rice and beans. And at night, muster up the courage to try León’s famous salsa dance clubs. "
Granada,"One of the country’s largest cities and situated along the shores of Lake Nicaragua, Granada offers travelers plenty of variety from site-seeing to activities. Take a stroll through this historic city, filled with brightly colored buildings remnant of Spanish colonialism, and explore the buzzing markets selling local goods and handicrafts. And head to the banks of Lake Nicaragua for horseback riding and ancient archaeological sites. "
Ambergris Caye,"In the only English-speaking country in Central America, tourists throughout the world can come to Belize and not have to stress over any language barrier. In this dreamy island off the coast of Belize, relaxation is the modus operandi. Swap out your slacks for shorts, turn in your professional-looking shoes for flip flops, and leave your stress back at home. Ambergris Caye is the ultimate getaway for beach lovers looking to retreat from civilization. Swim through the crystal-clear turquoise waters, bask under the warm Caribbean sun, and explore some of Belize’s exotic animals in the wildlife sanctuaries. "
The Hummingbird Highway,"At the foot of the Maya Mountain range, the Hummingbird Highway in Belize directs tourists through some of the most jaw-dropping views in Central America. The 55-mile-long highway winds through Belize’s jungles, citrus orchards, and impeccably picturesque villages, with gorgeous scenery at every turn. And the road is not to be travelled in one sitting, but rather tourists should consider stopping along the way. Visit Cave’s Branch along the Highway for cave tubing, or stop at St. Herman’s Cave, where you can explore the huge caverns and classic Mayan artifacts with a guide. And for the final touch, take a dive into the Blue Hole, a 25ft-deep sapphire-blue swimming hole off the Hummingbird Highway. "
Roatán,"The largest of the Bay Islands, Roatán is a prominent scuba diving destination in Central America. Snorkelers and scuba divers flock from all over the globe to this spot in the Caribbean Sea, where the second-largest barrier reef in the world surrounds the island. And for all those looking for their own slice of tropical paradise, Roatán features the region’s famous white sand beaches, turquoise waters, lush jungles, and exotic wildlife—without the mass tourism in the way. Come relax in this Central American oasis, where pure bliss is just the natural state of mind. "
A street in Ataco village on the Ruta de las Flores,"Translated literally as “The Flower Route,” this beautiful trail through El Salvador is like meandering through the history of the country itself. In a series of colonial and indigenous villages, La Ruta de las Flores captures the beautiful architecture and rich culture of the Salvadoran people. Browse through local markets with handmade crafts, try El Salvador’s renowned coffee from the source, and relax for a lazy weekend with authentic Salvadoran cuisine. If that’s too slow of a pace, you can also head to the Cordillera Apaneca, a volcanic mountain range with trails for mountain biking, horseback riding, and hiking. And scattered throughout the Apaneca are stunning waterfalls. "
Antigua,"Once the capital of the Spanish Empire in Central America (with Mexico City representing North America and Lima, Peru, and Buenos Aires, Argentina  representing South America), the historic town of Antigua, Guatemala is a must-see destination for Central American travelers. The enchanting Spanish architecture gives Antigua a quaint and romantic atmosphere. Stroll through this beautiful, old town with historic landmarks dotted throughout. Trek to Central Park, where you can lazily spend the day under the plush trees among the city’s monuments and fountains. And for full panoramic views of Antigua, climb up to the Hill of the Cross and take in the vastness of the land. "
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve,"Located along the Tilarán mountain range in Costa Rica, this reserve is one of Costa Rica’s most coveted tourist destinations. Around 400 species of birds, more than 100 species of mammals, 1,200 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 2,500 species of plants are all found at this mecca for biodiversity. In order to fully experience nature at work, tourists can go ziplining, hiking, Sky Walking over suspension bridges, and take canopy tours over the tree tops at Monteverde. In this majestic forest, you’re likely to come across wild pigs, moneys, porcupines, and many other wildlife species you may have never heard of. "
Arenal Volcano,"Up until 2010, Arenal was the most active volcano in Costa Rica. Its frequent, small eruptions displayed glorious shows of spewing lava for onlookers to admire. Now in its dormant phase, the explosions are indefinitely on hold. Even so, the area surrounding the Arenal provides an enchanting backdrop for any Central American traveler. Together with the dormant Chato Volcano, the Arenal Volcano makes up the Arenal Volcano National Park, inclusive with breath-taking lakes, rivers, mountains, and rainforests. Venture into nature for whitewater rafting, mountain climbing, ziplining, canopy tours, caving, and waterfall rappelling. And when you’re ready to relax from the day’s adrenaline, soak in the park’s natural hot springs created by the volcanic geothermal activity. "
N&#8217;Djamena,"The capital and largest city in Chad, N&#8217;djamena is a blend of modern and historic cultures. The population of N&#8217;Djamena is growing at an alarming rate due to many citizens of the country seeking the opportunities that come with life in the city. Despite the modern appearance of some buildings, there are many mud-brick structures that will remind you that you are still in one of the world&#8217;s poorest countries. The nightlife here is truly amazing and the lively bars have to be powered by hundreds of generators that reinforce the national grid. The national museum, which explores the history of Chad for the last several thousand years, and the central market are the two main attractions in the daytime. "
Sarh,"Sarh was once the site of the French Colonial Fort Archambault. It is located on the Chari River, roughly 350 miles away from the capital city of N&#8217;Djamena. The climate here is warm with a wet season which makes it perfect for cotton production; the city&#8217;s main export. Visitors will find that the city is served by an international airport and, although there are not many tourist sights as such, the city has a great performing arts scene. Music and concerts will keep you entertained into the early hours in Sarh. "
Faya-Largeau,Faya-Largeau is the largest city in the north of Chad and is one the very edge of the Sahara desert. The heat here is immense and temperatures rise above 40 degrees Celsius and regularly exceed this until October. The annual rainfall in the city is about half an inch. The reason to visit here is the nearby rugged terrain of the Sahara desert. If you can arrange a tour with a local guide then be prepared to be blown away by the harsh but beautiful Sahara desert. 
Zakouma National Park,"Zakouma National Park, in the south-eastern region of Chad, covers an area of roughly 3,000 square kilometers. It is regarded as one of the last places in Central Africa that is truly a refuge for wildlife and it is considered to be one of the most successful conservation efforts in the area. The park is teeming with rare and diverse species of mammals and birds. The Tinga Camp offers accommodation for up to 490 people and is in the heart of the best game viewing area in the park. You can enjoy your dinner whilst enjoying the ambiance of the African bush. "
Am Timan,Am Timan is the capital city of the Salamat region in Chad. The name translates to &#8220;mother of the twins&#8221; but the origin for the name remains unknown. The city is very poor and underdeveloped but is known for hosting the biggest and most vibrant markets in the county as well as incredible holiday celebrations. Conflicts in the area have affected cotton plantations and processing plants in the area but if you do find yourself in the city be sure to visit its market for the best shopping experience in the country. 
Bol,"The city of Bol is served by its own airport and can be found in the Lac region of the country. It is mostly visited because of Lake Chad which is very close by. Lake Chad was once the largest freshwater lake in the world however it is slowly drying up and even vanished completely during the droughts of 1984. In the dry season the lake usually occupies 10,000 square km but this can more than double in the wet season. A finger of this lake extends to Bol and is there all year. Try to hire a boat and explore the lake to witness hippos, floating islands and rare birds. "
Ennedi Desert,"The Ennedi region of Chadis home to the Ennedi Desert. The landscape is harsh, occupied mainly by scorpions and beetles but it is also home to some of the most beautiful and unusual rock formations in the world. The landscape is mostly flat but jutting up regularly are large stone arches and jagged rock formations that are like natural works of arts. The area is hard to reach and difficult to survive in, requiring carefully thought out plans and provisions, but those who venture here are rewarded with some of the most stunning natural landscapes in the world. "
Lakes of Ouianga,"Found in the Sahara Desert, the Lakes of Ouianga consists of 18 lakes in total which are supplied by so-called underground fossil water. The rain fell many thousands of years ago when the climate was much wetter than it is today. In fact the lakes now only receive 2mm of rainfall each year. Some of the lakes are salty whereas others are fresh and support life. The lakes are Chad&#8217;s sole Unesco World Heritage Site. "
Tibesti Mountains,"The Tibesti Mountains are difficult to reach and explore but there are many things here that will reward adventurous travellers. The highest peak here is the Emi Koussi which stands at 3,500m above sea level. The peak is actually a huge extinct volcano and only the experienced should consider climbing it. For travellers there are many great things to do in the area such as watching camel racing, view ancient rock art and enjoy the nearby hot thermal springs. "
Moundou,Moundou is the second largest city in Chad and lies on the Mbere River. The city is home to the Gala Brewery which has produced the most popular lager in the country since independence. More than a million barrels of the nectar are produced each year. Tours of the brewery are available for visitors and a cold glass of the lager is a great way to cool down from the intense heat of Chad. The city is also home of the Ngambi people. 
Douguia,"Douguia is as close as you will get to a tourist hotspot in the country of Chad. The city owes much of its tourist popularity to the Chari River on which it is situated. A popular activity in the city is to take a tour with Boatman, a local who will take you on a river tour in a traditional canoe. Along the way you will witness what life is like for local people as well as local bird and wild life. "
Abeche,"Capital of the Ouaddai Region and served by its own airport, Abeche is the fourth largest city in Chad. The city was the ancient capital of the country and has remnants littered throughout including mosques, sultan&#8217;s tombs and palace ruins. The ruins are kept safe behind a protective wall but the city has retained a lot of its ancient charm. Whilst walking the ancient streets, you will encounter many tribespeople from the surrounding desert. "
Aouk National Park,"Aouk National Park is another of Chad&#8217;s wildlife sanctuary&#8217;s and although the park has not flourished with the same protection as Zakouma National Park it is still home to a vast and impressive mix of mammals and birdlife. The park covers an area of around 7,500 kilometers and can be visited with a guide as part of a 4&#215;4 safari excursion. "
Goz Beida,"Goz Beida is a town in the Sila region of Chad. The town is best visited as a base for exploration of the nearby national park of the same name. The Goz Beida National Park occupies an area of around 3,000 square kilometers and, although it has been affected by conflicts as well as illegal poaching and other atrocities, it is a haven for both rare and endangered species. The town of Goz Beida has its own airport which is about 3 miles away from the town itself. "
Chester Cathedral,"Cheshire&#8217;s county town is as gorgeous as it is fascinating, and has enough heritage to last for more than a weekend break. To get a sense of Chester&#8217;s Roman castrum layout you can walk along the city walls, which, although they&#8217;ve been bolstered over time, have pretty much the same format as they did 2,000 years ago. Within the walls are medieval streets with black and white timber-framed buildings that crane over the cobblestones from five storeys up. You have to call in at the cathedral and see the wondrous medieval covered walkways at Chester Rows. Even now we&#8217;ve hardly made a dent on all the intriguing things to see and do in this outstanding city. "
Little Moreton Hall,"One of the last towns before the Peak District, Congleton is a smart market town with a useful choice of pubs and restaurants. Walkers could use the town as a jumping off point for excursions into the national park, while closer in you could ramble along the Dane River and the Biddulph Valley Way, which used to be a railway line transporting coal down to the potteries in Stoke. But Congleton really shines for Little Moreton Hall, a large half-timbered manor house encircled by a moat and gazing out on formal gardens. This awesome building went up in stages through the 1500s and will give students of Tudor history goosebumps for its wealth of original fittings, like leaded windows, interior wall paintings and Elizabethan fireplaces. "
Lion Salt Works,"As you wander around Northwich, remember that much of what you see is the legacy of salt mining, which took place under the town from Roman times right up to the 20th century. Throughout its history this granted Northwich a fair amount of wealth, but the downside (quite literally) was subsidence, diverting rivers and occasionally damaging building foundations. The award-winning Lion Salt Works offers the ultimate inside look at the Cheshire salt industry, while Weaver Hall was a Victorian workhouse,  a kind of forced labour camp where people ended up if they didn&#8217;t have the means to support themselves. More genteel is Arley Hall, which is a 19th-century building that revived the styles of Tudor and Stuart palaces from centuries before. "
Knutsford,"Those upmarket towns we mentioned in the intro are clustered in an area known as the Golden Triangle, where several of the most expensive streets in the Northwest are located. Knutsford is just this sort of place, brimming with fashion boutiques, delicatessens, wine bars and expensive restaurants. The town&#8217;s 18th-century townhouses and timber framed buildings complement the high-end atmosphere. There are also a few days out around Knutsford, like the Austen-esque Georgian estate, Tabley House. If you&#8217;re with the whole clan, try Gauntlet Birds of Prey, which has lots of raptors, from owls to falcons, and holds flight demonstrations that little ones won&#8217;t soon forget. "
"Nantwich, Cheshire","A disaster for the market town of Nantwich in 1583 has turned out to be a blessing for us. Most of the town burned down in a devastating fire, and such was the devastation that Elizabeth I helped fund the rebuild. What that gave us is an ensemble of well-designed Tudor buildings, all constructed at roughly the same time. Head to the high street and Hospital Street for some of the finest. The Crown Hotel on the high street is outstanding, with continuous windows on its cantilevered top floor. There&#8217;s also exciting modern history around Nantwich, at the Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker, a subterranean Cold War relic with many unsettling details like a medical room equipped to treat radiation burns. "
Sandbach,"If you need a first port of call for your trip to Sandbach, look no further than the market square. This location couldn&#8217;t be lovelier; the square is laid with irregular cobbles and historic architecture is all around, in the shape of rustic old pubs with timber frames. But the big sight in the square is the pair of stone Saxon crosses. These have been dated to the 800s and it&#8217;s exciting to see how vivid the complex carvings still are. These have the classic Saxon interlace patterns and vine scrolls, and if you study the pillars closely you&#8217;ll spot dragons, beasts and even religious images. "
Middlewich,"A narrowboat trip is a very laid-back way of seeing the Cheshire countryside, and one of the best places to start your voyage is at Middlewich. The town has been served by canals since it petitioned to have the Trent and Mersey Canal diverted here to transport the local chlorine and salt ash. This waterway connects with the Shropshire Union Canal via the Wardle Canal, which, at just 30 metres in length is the shortest in the country. If you visit in June you&#8217;ll be in time for the Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival, when hundreds of boats are moored in the town and there&#8217;s  busy schedule of gigs at pubs by the water. "
"Macclesfield, Nature","One of the best things about Cheshire&#8217;s former industrial towns is the way their old trades are commemorated at first-rate museums. In Macclesfield the big industry was silk-weaving, to the point where this place is still known as &#8220;The Silk Town&#8221; long after the industry disappeared in the 20th century. The Silk Museum, in the imposing Paradise Mill, will delight both industrial historians and people who love antique fashion and textiles. Macclesfield now is a well-heeled town, with plenty of independent shops to browse, all mingling with 19th-century architecture as the city was one of the only industrial centres to escape bombing in the Second World War. You could also swap the shopping streets for the moors as the Peak District is just a mile outside the town. "
Poynton,"A former coalmining town in hilly countryside, Poynton is in the lower climbs of the Pennines and within a green belt that preserve the surrounding countryside. You won&#8217;t struggle for opportunities to escape to this scenery as the Middlewood Way courses past Poynton  on the route of an old railway line from Marple down to Macclesfield. Your gateway to the trail is the Nelson Pit Visitor Centre, over a former colliery. There&#8217;s much more mining and general industrial history at the fantastic Anson Engine Museum, also belonging to an old mine. Here you can see one of Europe&#8217;s largest collections of stationary engines, with all types of pumps, turbines and generators. "
"Crewe, England","The town of Crewe was pivotal to the success of the Industrial Revolution in the northwest, because this is where the locomotives and railways originated. Crewe Railway Works was founded in 1840 and in its heyday employed a small army of 20,000 to build and service the machines that held the supply chains together. Even today Crewe is descirbed as a railway town and the local football team, Crewe Alexandra are the &#8220;Railwaymen&#8221;. Head for the Crewe Heritage Centre, built on the town&#8217;s old locomotive works and with lots of old diesel and electric locomotives to check out. "
Tarporley,"One of Cheshire&#8217;s prettiest villages has a high street with nothing but brick Victorian and Georgian houses, and is lined with wrought-iron gaslights for some extra old-time charm. You have a choice of bakeries and boutiques to peruse, and there are four pubs in the town for lunch or a pint. A few minutes to the south is Beeston Castle, which was constructed in the 13th century in a dominant setting on a sandstone crag 100 metres above the Cheshire Plain. As often happened, the castle was partly destroyed at the end of the Civil War to stop it being reused in future, but the ruins are very evocative and the vistas are nothing short of majestic. "
Wilmslow,"Another of those swish towns in the Golden Triangle, Wilmslow first caught the eye of the northwest&#8217;s wealthy businessmen and industrialists in Victorian times when the railways afforded swift links with Manchester and Liverpool. There are quite a few footballers living around here, including the legendary former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. Catering to these wealthy residents are high-end boutiques and restaurants, and if you need to know how posh Wilmslow is there&#8217;s a branch of Hoopers, a department store with only four locations around the country, including the ultra-fancy Harrogate and Tunbridge Wells. To get your feet back on the ground, the Quarry Bank Mill in Styal is one of the region&#8217;s most complete former mills, and as good a place as any to investigate the northwest&#8217;s textiles history. "
Warrington Town Hall,"Almost equidistant to Manchester and Liverpool, Warrington is a &#8220;New Town&#8221; and so a lot of what you see now didn&#8217;t exist before the post-war period. But before that it had been a market town, and had heavy industry in the 19th century when textile and tool-making mills were part of the townscape. These days people travel from surrounding towns and villages for shopping trips in the town centre. The leafy and historic suburb of Stockton Heath oozes character, and happily it&#8217;s also free of the usual English chain stores, with independent shops and restaurants instead. See Warrington Town Hall with its golden gates, poke around the cabinet of curiosities at Warrington Museum and bring the little ones to the petting zoo at the beautiful Walton Hall and Gardens estate. "
Alderley Edge,"This well-to-do village is only a short drive from Manchester, but England&#8217;s second city will feel a world away. Like the other settlements in the area, Alderley Edge is extremely desirable for Mancunians and so has the sort of shops and restaurants that high-earners frequent. Yet one of the best things in the village is absolutely free: Alderley Edge is named for a broad sandstone ridge that rises above the village. The highest point culminates at more than 200 metres and is protected by the National Trust. At Stormy Point you&#8217;ll be met by an inspiring view east to the Pennines and Peak District. "
"The Ring O Bells &#8211; Chester Road, Daresbury","Not far from Warrington, the little village of Daresbury would be a very satisfying place to while  away a few hours, even if it hadn&#8217;t been the birthplace of the author Lewis Carroll. As it is, there&#8217;s a fantastic visitor centre at the All Saints Church that will fill you in on Carroll&#8217;s early years in Daresbury and possible inspirations for Alice and Her Adventures in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll&#8217;s father had actually been the vicar her when the author was born in 1832. Also take a moment to appreciate the village and its old hall, before or after a quick pint at the lovely Ring &#8216;O Bells pub. "
Elqui Valley,"The Elqui Valley stretches about 140km from the beach town of La Serena all the way to the Argentinean border.  Steep mountains on both sides give way to a fertile green valley complete with vineyards, pisco distilleries, avocados, papayas, and oranges.  Charming little towns can be found throughout the valley and many of the pisco distilleries you come across will be too inviting to pass up a tasting.  Don’t miss the Observatorio Cerro Mamalluca, the valleys most popular attraction.  Here you can see other galaxies through their 30cm telescope. For the perfect end to any day, you’ll love star gazing and UFO sighting under crystal clear skies. "
Valparaiso,"One of the most unique cities in Chile is Valparaiso.  Climbing up the sides of 42 hills, the city has a bohemian vibe that everyone loves.  There are several funiculars that take you up and down various hills so that you can enjoy the view and the many colourful houses at the top.  You’ll also love getting lost in the maze of cobblestone alleys that somehow magically connect all the hills.  Stop in to a different “little café” every day, enjoy the street art, and in the evenings, watch the lights sparkle across the bay.  This UNESCO World Heritage Site is still undergoing restoration, but even in this period of transition, the town offers incredible colour and charm. You might want to check out La Sebastiana, the former home of poet Pablo Neruda, and downtown’s Plaza Sotomayor. "
Torres Del Paine,"You really can’t miss the granite pillars of Torres del Pain, or the Tower of Paine.  They rise more than 2000m over the Patagonian steppe and dominate what is possibly the most majestic national park in all of South America.  Though long exploited before it became a national park, there is still a ton of “wow” to be seen here. Everyone will love the trails that take you through lush forests, rickety bridges over rushing rivers, and a giant and vibrant blue glacier. A designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserve for almost 40 years, you’ll find Andean condors, flamingo, rhea, and more. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a peek at the guanaco, the puma, and the endangered huemul. If you’re looking for a great camping experience, try the “W” hike that allows you to sleep in beds and get warm meals all along the way. "
Valle de la Luna,"A tiny town in northern Chile, San Pedro De Atacama is a Spanish colonial town surrounded by the driest desert in the world.  Set on a high plateau in the Andes, you’ll find salt flats, geyser, hot springs, and salt flats here.  Be sure to stop by the Valle de la Luna to see the unique rock formations, lunar-like depression, and pink-streaked mountains. Get lost in the adobe streets and tree-lined plaza while rambling through this charming town. There’s a high concentration of copper and quartz in the region which is given all the credit for the good vibes in this popular tourist destination. "
Santiago,"The capital and largest city in Chile is Santiago.  It sits in a valley surrounded by the breathtaking snow capped Andes Mountains.  Locals will tell you that Santiago IS Chile, and it really won’t take long before you agree.  Plaza de Armas is the city’s colonial heartbeat.  You’ll find two extraordinary landmarks, the Royal Court Palace, home of the National History Museum, and the Metropolitan Cathedral, built in the 18th century. Each neighbourhood has its own distinct vibe and it’s a fun game to see which one feels most like home for you.  In the evenings, check out Barrio Bellavista and Barrio Brasil for the crazy all-night parties. Santiago is surprisingly cosmopolitan and filed with history, cultural events, fine-dining, and incredible nature. "
Vina del Mar,"Most people come to Vina del Mar for the beaches. But there is a whole other side to this important Chilean town.  One hour north of Santiago, you’ll find La Quinta Vergara, an exotic garden in the heart of the city; each February there’s a huge music festival held in the garden. Parque Reloj de Flore, a giant outdoor clock nestled in a huge flower bed and considered by most visitors to be one of the more interesting places in the city. There’s also Castilo Wulff, a quirky castle sitting on a rocky outcropping of the beach.  The architecture is decidedly European, which makes it stand out oddly.  There’s a casino inside the castle which makes a nice evening diversion after sunning and swimming all day. "
Easter Island,"In the middle of the Pacific, about 3200km from Chile is Rapa Nue and Isla de Pascua.  Discovered by the Dutch in the 18th century, Easter Island is the most isolated and yet still inhabited island in the world.  This UNESCO World Heritage Site is famous for the enormous statues carved from volcanic rock and representing the same figure; perhaps a god or other ancestor. You have to fly to island in order to get there and there are a number of guided tours that are worth the money in order to hear the mysteries of the island explained – to the best anyone understands.  Annexed by Chile over 100 years ago, this tiny island is one of Earth’s greatest mysteries, and surely not to be missed. "
Antofagasta,Antofagasta is definitely an urban working class city and many tourists don’t tend to spend much time here.  But it’s worth a stop to explore the old-fashioned plaza and the Barrio Histórico with its remarkable Georgian and Victorian architecture. It’s a major port town and a walk along the piers will make you feel that you’ve stepped back in time a century or two. 
Arica,"Known as the City of Eternal Spring, Arica is the northernmost city in Chile, close to the Peruvian border.  The area was inhabited as long ago as 6000 BC and the native tribes who lived here knew agriculture, pottery, and were considered a part of the Incan Empire. Today, Arica is a lovely seaside resort, complete with miles of coastline, golden dunes, and an energetic nightlife.  It makes a great jumping off point to explore the inland ruins of ancient cultures as well as Lauca National Park – which has the highest mountain lake on Earth. "
The Lake District,"If you want nature, Chile’s lake district is the place to go. Alerce (Larch) forests, volcanoes capped with snow, fabulous mountain lakes, traditional folklore and handicrafts, and year-round outdoor adventure can all be found here.  Home to 12 major lakes and a few dozen smaller ones, the district is well named.  You’ll also find hot springs, rivers, waterfalls, and six volcanoes – the highest (Villarica) topping out at 2800m.  There are several great towns in the district.  Consider visiting Temuco, Puerto Montt, Chiloé, and the Chiloé Archipelago with its hundreds of tiny islands. "
Puerto Montt,"A city of note in the Lake District is Puerto Montt.  It’s the capital of the district and the gateway to the Patagonian fjords as well as the Andes Mountains. The Plaza de Armas square is home to a 19th century neoclassical cathedral, and Casa del Arte Diego Rivera is a surprisingly gallery with works by both national and local artists.  Nearby you’ll find Caleta de Angelmó, a great local market, and a little further out you’ll find the active volcano, Calbuco. "
Talca,"At one time, Talca was a major Chilean city.  The country’s declaration of independence was signed here in 1818.  Today, it makes a perfect home base to explore this incredible region.  At the top of the “must-see” list are the phenomenal Reserva Nacional Altos de Lircay and the Maule Valley vineyards.  It’s a cosy town with great views of the Andes and you’ll love spending a few slow days here to rest and recuperate. "
Valle de Copiapó,"Another great base camp town is Copiapó.  It’s most often used by those who want to adventure into Laguna Verde, Parque Nacional Nevado Tres Cruces, and Ojos del Salado, the world’s highest active volcano.  Copiapó had the nation’s first telegraph and telephone lines, and was the first place to use gas.  All of this was due to the gold rush of the 18th century. There’s a wonderful main plaza here and lots of historic buildings to discover, though it’s mainly a hard-working mining town with lots of character. "
Valdivia,"Valdivia is a thriving university town that is well known, among other things, for the arts and an eclectic craft beer culture.  However, most come for the history and the beauty of the city and surrounding areas. Valdivian Week is well known among travellers and commemorates the founding of the city.  If you’re there at this time, you’ll love the artisan market, amusement rides, the parade of ships, and the fireworks extravaganza that ends the week. One of the most popular historical buildings is the Mercado Municipal, or municipal market.  Once a simple market, it’s now a food Mecca.  Be sure to check out, Saint Francis Convent and the dozen of European influence buildings beings used by the city’s cultural centres and government. "
La Serena,"Thanks to some stellar beaches and historic architecture, Chile’s second oldest city has become a very popular destination among domestic and foreign tourists.  Nicknamed the City of the Belfries because of the many churches, the old part of the city is consider to be the most important “traditional area” in all of Chile. Avenida del Mar, or Sea Avenue, runs for about 6km and is separated into 12 beaches.  All of which are great for sunning and any number of water sports.  Each summer you can attend the La Serena Song Festival, which has been growing in prominence since 2004.  The history buffs will enjoy the Church Cathedral of La Serena which was designated an UNESCO Historical Monument in 1981. "
Shanghai,"Shanghai is a city that sprawls and seethes with the energy of more than 24 million people and is one of the world’s largest cities. It gradually increased in importance as a city throughout the dynastic ages of the Song and Ming, but it was under the Qing that it boomed to become the most important trading port on the Yangtze River Delta. In the present day Shanghai is much the same and the shimmering skyscrapers on the Bund are testament to the city’s trading power. You will still find traces of the old however in the numerous historic buildings and the leafy canals of the French Concession. "
"Forbidden City, Beijing","Beijing is the capital of China and a typical big city that never sleeps. With a population of over 21 million, it is slightly smaller than Shanghai, although it is also the political center of the country and home of iconic spots like Tiananmen Square. One of the big draws here is the fascinating Forbidden City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties lived, and you will find opulent ceramics, artwork, fountains and thrones here. The National Museum of China is also located in Beijing and is one of the most acclaimed art institutions in the country. "
Hong Kong,"Hong Kong locals may not like being listed alongside cities on the mainland, which tells you everything you need to know about how different this Special Administrative Region of China is from the People’s Republic. The region has political and economic autonomy from China (for the most part) and is a global powerhouse of finance and trading. Some of the highlights here taking a rattling tram to the top of majestic Victoria Peak, visiting the bustling markets of Kowloon, and exploring the themes parks on Lantau Island. "
Guilin,"Guilin is a great place to come for anyone looking for adventure amidst soaring karst mountains that look like something from another planet. Guilin is known for its gingko-dotted parklands located around Pagoda Hill as well as its winding historic streets that straddle the majestic Li River. If you venture out into the surrounding Guangxi Province then you will find craggy sacred peaks, caves, grottoes, and mist covered mountains. "
Chengdu Panda Research Base,"The town of Chengdu is now famous on the traveler trail for one reason only, its resident pandas. The Chengdu Panda Research Base is the place to come if you want to get up close to these amazing bears, and the base is a research facility rather than a zoo so know that you are contributing to the upkeep and breeding programs of the pandas if you come here. As well as the elegant and graceful pandas, you can also enjoy other parts of Chengdu such as People’s Park which is famous for its street performers. Other areas of interest include Jinli Ancient Street which is well known for its architecture from the Qing Dynasty, as well as the Kuanzhaixiangzi District which has a range of amazing ancient teahouses that are not to be missed. "
Guangzhou,"The city of Guangzhou presents the typical modern image of neon-lit China and in recent years this town has exploded in every direction. Skyscrapers dot the horizon and you will find shimmering buildings jostling for space in the downtown area of the city that also sits of the Pearl River. The architecture here is some of the most eclectic in China and you will find Qing edifices at the Xiguan Residence as well as many examples of old Canton buildings. This is mixed with Anglo-style houses in places like Shamian Island which invoke images of rural England. As if that wasn’t enough, Guangzhou is covered in museums like the Mausoleum of King Zhao Mo which is full of artifacts that date back 2,100 years. "
Macau,"Macau is a place of bright lights, glitz, glamour, and gambling, and millions of visitors flock here from mainland China every year. The main draw is the click of poker chips and the sprawling gaming halls, and you can visit some of the biggest names in the casino business like the MGM Grand and the Venetian. Macau is not just about gambling however, so if you want to see a different side of it then you can visit some of the legacies of its colonial past under the Portuguese. Some of these include its famous fort, churches, and Baroque homes. If you want to get away from the more crowded parts of the island, then head to the seaside areas of Coloane or Taipa. "
Yulong River valley,"Covered in the needle-like spires of karst peaks, the city of Yangshuo is truly breathtaking. This city is located in the southern part of Guangxi Province and the Li River drifts lazily through the Yangi-Xingping Scenic Area. As such, you can expect bulbous mountains and sculpted mountain ranges that are the perfect place to go trekking and climbing, especially in the Yulong River Valley. In the city of Yangshuo proper, you can also take traditional martial arts or Chinese cooking classes to fully immerse yourself in the local culture. "
"terracotta army, Xi&#8217;An","Xi’an is one of the four great capitals of old China and this is where centuries of history come together. It is of course the home of the mighty terracotta army which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is made up of thousands of figures of horsemen and soldiers which were buried with the Emperor Qin Shi Huang to protect him in the afterlife. As well as the terracotta army, Xi’an is also known for having the longest city walls in the world which sprawls for 13 kilometers in length, as well as mosques and Taoist temples that tell of the multiculturalism that came from this being a spot on the famed Silk Road. "
Jiuzhaigou,"The valley of scenic Jiuzhaigou sparkles and shimmers with hues of turquoise blue and green thanks to its mountain lakes that have made this part of Sichuan famous. For anyone interested in hiking or climbing, this is an excellent spot to visit, particularly if you venture to places like the Pearl Shoal Waterfall and the glassy Long Lake. Other draws in the area include the Zharu Buddhist Monastery as well as the craggy peaks of Nuorilang. "
"West Lake, Hangzhou","Sitting at the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta is the city of Hangzhou which has long been known as an important terminus for trade. The city has grown over the years and is now a booming metropolis of 10 million people. If you are visiting the city, the big draws here are the historical treasures and cultural relics such as West Lake, the Broken Bridge, the Qing Dynasty Mid-Lake Pavilion, and the pagodas of the Lesser Yingzhou Isle. "
"Mosque, Kashgar",Kashgar is one place in the deep west of China that doesn’t feel Chinese at all. Having fallen to the Kushan Empire you will find bulbous Mughal-style mosques here and the atmosphere if more reminiscent of an Afghan town than anything else. 
"Yuantong Temple, Kunming","Kunming sits 2,000 meters above sea level and is a place of soaring peaks that is also known as the ‘City of Eternal Spring’. The altitude here means that it is cooler than other spots in Yunnan and you can enjoy cultural relics such as Yuantong Temple which dates back 1,200 years. Other top spots include the Daguan Pavilion and the Stone Forest Reserve which takes the form of a series of spiky mountains. "
Hainan,"Hainan sometimes feels more like Southeast Asia than China and is located in the south of the country jutting out into the South China Sea. Here you will find lush jungles, coconut palms, and pine forests, as well as some of the prettiest beaches in China. One of the best of these is Sanya Beach as well as the secluded coves of Monkey Island which has a wealth of resident simians as the name suggests. "
Harbin,"Harbin is covered in snowy cobblestoned streets and onion-dome shaped mosques, meaning that it hardly seems Chinese at all. Much of this is down to the Russian influence here as many Russian nationals flocked here in 1917. You will be able to visit the Russian Quarter of the city as well as enjoy some potent vodka and view Siberian tigers on the nearby nature reserves. If you like skiing, then make sure not to miss Deer Flats for a chance to hit the slopes. "
"Bogota, Colombia","Another of South America’s soaring capital cities, the sprawling, seething metropolis of Bogota makes its home on the ridges of the Colombian Eastern Cordillera. Just shy of nine million Colombians live, work and play here, making it an electric place to visit. The best known district &#8211; La Candelaria – is a lesson in all things colonial. Trodden by Simon Bolivar and awash with low-rise pueblo cottages, cobblestone streets and the gorgeous La Catedral, it’s simply not to be missed. Elsewhere, Bogota offers up the dramatic funicular ride to the tips of Cerro de Monserrate, while football crowds roar in El Campin and the various museums house everything from mysterious Incan gold works to Spanish portraiture. "
"Cartagena, Colombia","Colombia’s Caribbean come colonial gem is a mass of coral-stone forts and crumbling stuccoed homes, all strung along the country’s finest stretch of coastline. The Old Town is the piece de resistance for sure; a place where labyrinthine alleys weave and turn past gorgeous Baroque mansions and Spanish churches burst onto sunny plazas where babbling fountains mirror the colours of the blooming flower baskets on the nearby palazzo. And then there’s the swish side of town: Bocagrande. Here, Gucci-bearing, bikini-clad folk rollerblade along the beachfronts, sip pina coladas in the Carib sun and tan themselves between the lines of swaying palm trees. "
"Medellin, Colombia","The onetime epicentre of the infamous Medellin Cartel has gone full chameleon, changing virtually entirely since the days when Pablo Escobar ruled its potholed streets and ramshackle barrios of breeze blocks and corrugated roofs. Today, Medellin is a buzzing, artsy university town that boasts the likes of the fascinating Museo de Antioquia and the restored homes of countless Colombian writers and artists. Public art displays adorn many a street corner, popping up in metallic canopies above the town’s Botanical Gardens, or with curious avant-garde carvings on the plazas (Medellin isn’t called the ‘City of Sculptures’ for nothing!). The rugged ridges of the Aburra Valley can also be reached by cable car from the town &#8211; great for sunset viewing! "
"San Gil, Colombia","Hemmed in by the steep-sided valleys and wild ridges of the mighty Cordillera Oriental – the easternmost branch of the Colombian Andes – San Gil has risen and risen to become perhaps the country’s most famed outdoorsy hub. With the palm-dotted, misty hills of the Yariguies National Park to the west and the sanctuaries of the Rio Fonce to the east, it’s easy to see how the small city gets by on attracting hikers, bikers, white water rafters, rock climbers, wildlife seekers, gorge walkers – the list goes on! Those who do opt to break out into the wildernesses here can expect the breathtaking likes of the Chicamocha Canyon, the rustic village of Jordan, deep caves and oodles more! "
"Santa Marta, Colombia","Strung out along the beautiful coastal reaches of Magdalena Department, Santa Marta is arguably the prime spot for beach lovers in all of Colombia. The town itself is sandwiched between the snow-mantled peaks of the Sierra Nevada and the deep blue, cerulean rollers of the Caribbean Sea. The sand stretches in the city are truly wonderful, complete with granite boulders dotting the shore and swaying lines of palm trees. In nearby Taganga, meanwhile, backpackers sip cerveza and prep for diving in the legendary coral gardens and coves of the Tayrona National Park. Others make a beeline for the secluded sands of Bahia Concha, or head to the Sierras, where rustic pueblos like Minca and jungle-shrouded Paso Del Mango are set to the sounds of chirping tropical birds and babbling rainforest creeks. "
Manizales,"Manizales can be found nestled in a beautiful valley of spiked and serrated Andean hills, right on the edge of the famous Coffee Valley in the very heart of the Colombian mountain region. A relatively modern town that was founded by pacifists in the middle of the 1800s, when civil wars raged through the land, Manizales still oozes a charming laid-back vibe that&#8217;s difficult not to like. Today, there are plenty of earthy little bakeries and cantinas to enjoy, where it’s also possible to sip potent fresh coffees in the company of chatty locals. Outside of the town and the beautiful snow-mantled ridges of the Nevado del Ruiz soar above the horizon; a glacier-topped volcano that’s home to spectacled bears and tapirs alike. "
"Pereira, Colombia","A down-to-earth, gritty city that’s the veritable epicentre of Colombia’s iconic Coffee Valley, Pereira buzzes with enterprise and big business. Benefitting from the fertile soils and hospitable climate of the Risaralda region, the city has grown and grown, booming with coffee bean and sugarcane depots by the bucket load. Today, the spot remains a little off-the-beaten-track and certainly less visited than some of the other towns in the Valle de Cauca. That makes it a great place to sample Colombia’s local highland character, sip potent coffees in earthy cantinas, and take a tour of the bean plantations in the hills – all without the usual crowds. The roaring waterfalls and bubbling hot springs of Santa Rosa are also nearby – perfect for getting away from the urban fray. "
"Barichara, Colombia","Whitewashed pueblo homes and adobe cottages with half-baked terracotta roofs line up all along Barichara’s cobbled alleys and roads. Set over the sultry hills and scrublands of Santander in the northern reaches of the country, this is the sort of cowboy come gaucho town you’d expect to see in a Sergio Leone flick. Its center is crowned by the colossal Cathedral of Barichara, which balances well with the humble, mud-built chapel to the Virgin Mary on the nearby roadways. Neat little craft workshops touting woven fabrics hide in the bungalows, while the wild karst hills and cloud-topped peaks of the untrodden Serrania De Los Yariguies beckon with adventures aplenty to the west. Nice. "
"Villa de Leyva, Colombia","No matter who you are, there’s simply no escaping the charm of Villa de Leyva. Hailed by most as the single handsomest town in the nation, this patchwork of wobbly cobbled roads and whitewashed buildings is a lesson in all things Spanish colonialism. Perfectly preserved, the city stands like a great museum piece amidst the low Andean hills of Boyaca. It draws thousands of day-trippers out of the capital at Bogota too, who come to wallow on the sun-splashed plaza at the town’s heart, taste fine-dining in the new wave of international eateries fringing the 16th century streets, and delve into the fascinating Museum of Paleontology and Museo del Carmen alike. "
"Popayan, Colombia","Popayan is hailed as the White City, and can be found spread out nearly 2,000 meters up on the ridges of the great Cordillera Occidental. Shimmering and shining in the Andean sun, the town is awash with photogenic churches and governmental builds left over from Spanish rule. Take the square-cut Clock Tower in the heart of town, or the gloriously adorned Santo Domingo church, looking plucked straight from the backwater towns of Andalusia. Then there’s the breathtaking sight of the Catedral Basilica, a glorious example of neoclassical colonial design that’s been meticulously restored after a destructive earthquake in the 1980s. Yes sir, Popayan is one darn pretty town to explore! "
Termales Santa Rosa de Cabal,"Nestled deep in the wild folds of the Cordillera Central, where the two mighty chains of the Colombian Andes spread out northwards, the effortlessly pretty town of Santa Rosa de Cabal is a real must on any itinerary through the country. It’s famed primarily for its Termales hot springs, which bubble and froth through the jungles nearby, overlooking dramatic waterfalls and the wild foothills of the mountains. Between the city streets themselves, travelers will discover some charming little plazas and palm-dotted walkways, while mineral mines and bucolic villages pepper the highlands and valleys all around. "
"San Agustin, Colombia","Steeped in myth, legend and raw, pre-Colombian history, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of San Agustin is like nowhere else in all of South America. Travelers flock to the far-flung spot amidst the rainforests and winding river channels of southern Huila Department to seek out the famous anthropomorphic monolith carvings that were discovered lurking in the various burial mounds and chieftain tombs here. They are thought to have been constructed sometime after the 8th century, and belie a complex spiritual relationship with the afterlife, making this one of the most enthralling and fascinating sacred sites in the country. What’s more, San Agustin boasts a beautiful location betwixt the verdant valleys that line the Magdalena River! "
"Mompox, Colombia","There are few places as elegant and handsome as Santa Cruz de Mompox (that’s just Mompox for short). Set over the waterways of the appropriately-named Bolivar Department (it was here that the revered Venezuelan revolutionary Simon Bolivar came to raise troops in 1812), the town glows in hues of white and yellow, punctuated in the middle by the maroon-red facades of its gorgeous San Francisco Church (don’t miss the frescos!). Other pulls include the artworks of the House of the Apostles and the sun-splashed cobbles of Plaza Concepcion; a gorgeous little square where local folk sip coffee, the mellifluous Spanish tongue echoes throughout the evening, and merengue dances erupt ad hoc in the cantinas. "
"Salento, Colombia","Rising from amidst the sea of coffee plantations and swaying palm tree groves that is the Eje Cafetero (one of the heartlands of the Colombian coffee growing axis), Salento is a laid-back provincial backwater with a lacing of bona fide colonial charm and an earthy, local Quindio character. The horizons around the city are spiked with the mist-topped, snowy peaks of the Los Nevados National Park and its 5,000-meter-high volcanos, while the maze of tight-knit streets and their pretty rows of painted craft boutiques that form the center rarely fail to impress. Be sure to sample the trout dishes (the Salento version is famous) and head out on a coffee tour to see the best of the region as a whole. "
"Santiago de Cali, Colombia","Beating with the rhythms of salsa (one of the more famous exports of this two million-strong city in the midst of the Valle del Cauca), Santiago de Cali – or just Cali for short – is a great place to while away some time before making a beeline for the coffee plantations and wilds of the Cordillera Occidental. Start by flitting between the preserved Spanish churches in the colonial center, then wonder at the Gothicism of the La Ermita, or head for the heights of the Cerro de las Tres Cruces for views over the tops of the town. Sports and adventure are big here too, and travelers can opt to hike and bike in the surrounding mountains, or settle in with the roaring locals for a football match at the colossal Estadio Olimpico.

Mohéli,"Mohéli is the smallest and yet the most fascinating of the Comoros Islands.  When people talk about wanting to drop off the face of the Earth, this is the place.  There are very few inhabitants on the island and thanks to this it’s largely undeveloped and completely wild. To the point that it’s a little backwards – a bit stuck in the past.   You’ll find the country’s only national park here: Parc Marin de Mohéli. Nature lovers will want to check out the craggy islets that dot the island. The locals call it Mwali or Moili and it’s a great place for spotting marine life like sea turtles, whales, and dolphins.  There is so much pristine beauty here that visitors don’t usually mind the lack of modern amenities. Mohéli is considered by many to be the highlight of the Comoros Islands. "
Fomboni,"The largest city on Mohéli is Fomboni, a quiet and unassuming little place. There’s a nameless main street through town, a market, and a jetty worth checking out.  The locals here tend to be more reserved than their neighbours on Anjouan and Grande Comore but they’ll give you a friendly welcome for sure.  It’s a great place to watch the locals be local and get a sense of what life is like on Mohéli. "
Anjouan,"The locals call it Ndzouani, and this Comorian island is the stuff that fantasies are made of.  Anjouan is nicknamed “The Pearl of the Comoros” because of its Robinson Crusoe qualities.  If you want remote, unspoilt, and gorgeous, you’ll find it here.  You’ll find old Arab plantations and the scent of cloves and ylang-ylang on every breeze. You’ll find the locals hard-working and intensely proud of their little island.  Travel up into the highlands for cooler air and to watch the mists roll across the rainforests. "
Grande Comore,"At 60km across and 20km wide, Grande Comore is the largest of the Comoros Islands.  It’s also the most developed with the most stable economy.  One of the most popular towns, Moroni, is located here.  As you travel the island you’ll find again and again that the dark and intriguing solidified lava and the contrasting white sand beaches make a stunningly beautiful landscape.  Grande Comore is a great spot for honeymooners or couple hoping to get away from their busy lives.  Most of population lives on the west coast, but if you travel south you’ll find a lovely agricultural landscape filled with vanilla, coconut, banana, and cassava plantations. "
Mount Karthala,"The largest active volcano in the world is Mount Karthala located on Grande Comore.  It stands at just over 2300 metres and has consistently erupted every 11 years since the beginning of the 19th century.  The last eruption was in 2005 and lasted 14 days! The volcano did quite a bit of damage in 2005, but the country has recovered nicely.  You’ll love the bizarre yet spectacular landscape that the lava creates and it makes the hiking rather unique. You can climb to the volcano’s rim, but be warned, it’s a difficult two day trek. "
Moroni,"The capital of Comoros is Moroni, located on Grande Comore Island.  There’s a romantic and distinctly Arabian vibe here and you’ll feel like you’re in a different world compared to the rest of the islands.  The narrow streets are filled with quaint shops and cafes and the locals wear traditional dress. Enjoy the Volvo Market and pick up some great souvenirs, spices, and handicrafts from local artisans. Check out the medina near the Friday Mosque and get lost in the winding alleyways. Like the rest of the Comoros, there aren’t a lot of traditional tourist attractions, but the beauty always more than makes up for it. "
Mayotte,"Mayotte is probably the most traditional tourist spot in the Comoros.  Still governed by the French, many think that the island is overpriced and out of sync with the remote paradise vibe the rest of the island have.  But you’ll find unbelievable turquoise waters, white sand, and top shelf snorkelling, sailing, and diving here. Not surprisingly, there’s a large ex-pat community here and there’s a bit of tension between the Mahorais and the other islanders, but thanks to French rule, there’s a great deal of stability and infrastructure here. "
Dziani Dzaha,"This is where you’ll find most of the ex-pats in Comoros.  The island has two villages: L’Abattoir and Pamandzi.  You can visit the volcanic crater of Dziani Dzaha, the rock of Dzaoudzi (a less dramatic version of the Rock of Gibraltar), and the archaeological site known as Bagamayo, where artefacts from a 10th century Shirazi settlement continue to be discovered. It’s a bit high end for budget backpackers, but if you’re able to splurge, you can’t go wrong with the amazing French cuisine that you’ll find on the island – think crab and frog legs! "
Mamoudzou,"Mamoudzou is where you’ll find the restaurants, businesses, and shopping on Mayotte. It’s a large town and many areas are neglected, but this is still the best place for shopping and eating on the island. "
Ntingui,"The highest mountain on Anjouan is Mt Ntingui.  It stands at almost 1600 metres and it’s a challenging trek to the top.  Because of the weather, the peak is often cloud covered, but if you’re one of the lucky ones, and the cloud clears, you’ll get a phenomenal view of the four islands in the archipelago. To reach the top you’ll hike through lush green forest and have a chance to spot some of the exotic bird species here. "
Silver Sands State Park,"Visiting Silver Sands State Park is a must for anyone who wants to experience Connecticut at its most beautiful. With a wide range of activities, such as swimming in Long Island Sound or the bird sanctuary of Charles Island, Silver Sands State Park is also located very close to the similarly superb Walnut Beach. Heron and egret rookeries are found at Charles Island, which can be reached by foot when the water is at low tide. The snowy owl and the rough-legged hawk are among the birds that can be seen at the bird sanctuary. "
Wadsworth Falls State Park,"Wadsworth Falls State Park &#8211; which is sometimes just called Wadsworth Falls &#8211; is one of Connecticut&#8217;s most beautiful natural locations. The falls themselves are a 1.25 mile hike away from the main entrance to the park, but the trek is not a difficult one and the views of the 30-foot falls are well worth a little effort. There are also many picnic and swimming facilities at the park. Grills for use in cook outs make Wadsworth Falls State Park particularly popular in the summer. "
"Greenwich, Connecticut","The largest town on Connecticut&#8217;s Gold Coast, Greenwich is named after a borough in London and has previously been named among the Best Places to Live in the United States. The Greenwich International Film Festival is one of the town&#8217;s most popular annual events, while the Bruce Museum and the Audubon Center are also worth visiting. Greenwich Avenue is a must for anyone who has a passion for shopping. "
"St Mary&#8217;s By The Sea In Bridgeport, Connecticut","St Mary&#8217;s By The Sea in Bridgeport, Connecticut "
"Gillette Castle Park, East Haddam, Connecticut","Gillette Castle looks just like a medieval fortress and it is certainly one of the most visually interesting buildings to see in the state of Connecticut. Gillette Castle State Park was originally the home of the actor William Gillette, who was best known for his stage portrayal of the detective Sherlock Holmes. Today, the castle &#8211; which was called Seventh Sister &#8211; is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Gillette Castle is also a Viewpoint Exhibit Host Site. "
"Old Saybrook, Connecticut","Old Saybrook is one of Connecticut&#8217;s most historic places, and one of the state&#8217;s most beautiful locations too. The Lynde Point Lighthouse is one of the most stunning landmarks in the town, while the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center and the General William Hart House are among the most popular tourist attractions in the area. Spending a relaxing day at Harvey&#8217;s Beach is one of the best things to do in Old Saybrook, or anywhere in Connecticut, while families will love playing a game of Mini-Golf at Saybrook Point, which boasts breathtaking scenery. "
"Stonington, Connecticut","Located on Connecticut&#8217;s beautiful coastline, Stonington is a great place to visit to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. Home to some of the state&#8217;s most historic buildings, such as Capt. Nathaniel B. Palmer House, Stanton-Davis Homestead Museum and the William Clark Company Thread Mill, Stonington is known for its intensely relaxing atmosphere. Stonington Vineyards and the town&#8217;s Old Lighthouse Museum are well worth visiting. "
Shore Line Trolley Museum,"One of the best things to do in East Haven is definitely to spend a few hours at the Shore Line Trolley Museum. Exhibits on trolley history in the visitors&#8217; center are surprisingly fascinating, but the highlight of the museum is undoubtedly the chance to take a ride on restored trolleys along its 1.5 miles of track. Around 100 vintage transit vehicles are housed within the museum and all of them are beautiful in their own special way. "
"Iwo Jima Memorial, Connecticut","No first-time visit to Connecticut would be complete without taking a detour to the US National Iwo Jima Memorial. The memorial was both conceived and designed by Dr. George Gentile, who was the founder and president of the Iwo Jima Survivors Association. Some 6,821 Americans lost their lives fighting on the last strategic stronghold before the planned invasion of Japan and among the features of the memorial park is an eternal flame dedicated to those brave soldiers. "
"Saville Dam, Barkhamsted, Connecticut","Saville Dam at Barkhamsted Reservoir has a case to be named the most beautiful man-made structure in the state of Connecticut. The dam, which is named after its chief engineer, Caleb Mills Saville, is the primary water source for Hartford, Connecticut. The views that can be enjoyed from the dam simply have to be seen to be believed &#8211; they are absolutely glorious and unforgettable. "
"Yale University, New Haven","As one of the top universities in the United States, Yale is one of Connecticut&#8217;s most important places. Located in the city of New Haven, the history of education at the site dates back for around 400 years. A walk through Yale&#8217;s scenic and historic Old Campus provides some of the most stunning views in Connecticut, while guided tours are also available for those who want to learn more about the university. Yale also hosts many events throughout the year, from exhibitions and workshops to film screenings and performances &#8211; there is always lots going on at Yale. "
Goodspeed Opera House,"The Goodspeed Opera House is not just one of the most beautiful places in Connecticut, it is also one of the state&#8217;s most important cultural institutions, as this is where some of the world&#8217;s most famous musicals, including Annie, Man of La Mancha and Shenandoah were created. The Goodspeed Opera House is particularly beautiful at night, where the contrast between the white building and the dark swing bridge nearby is stunning. Tours of many of the Goodspeed facilities are available to visitors too. "
Enders Falls State Park,"Enders is mainly forest, but those who like to see waterfalls during their hikes in natural surroundings will also find lots to love at Enders Falls State Park. A walk alongside the gentle Enders Brook is one of the best things to do in the whole state. Campbell Falls State Park in Norfolk and Bigelow Hollow State Park in Union are also nearby for those who want to make the most of Connecticut&#8217;s natural beauty. "
Kent Falls State Park,"Kent Falls is a designated Trout Park, but there is a lot more to Kent Falls State Park than fishing. A replica of a covered bridge is one of the many must-see highlights at Kent Falls, which has lots of opportunities for hiking and picnicking. As for the falls themselves, they are absolutely sublime, with water dropping for around 250 feet over a distance of a quarter of a mile. The largest of these drops is around 70 feet and the overall effect of the waterfall is truly amazing. &nbsp; "
Campbell Falls State Park,"Campbell Falls State Park is one of the most undeveloped areas of parkland within the state of Connecticut, which makes it an ideal place to visit for those who want to see nature at its most unspoiled. The park crosses the border with Massachusetts and there is even a stone within the grounds to mark where the two states meet. The park&#8217;s namesake waterfall cascades nearly 100 feet and is a truly stunning sight when the water is in full flow. "
"Guilford, Connecticut","Guilford is a must-visit location for anyone vacationing in Connecticut, with the town having been named one of the top 100 places to live in the United States. Henry Whitfield State Museum and Bishop&#8217;s Orchards are two of the best things to do in Guilford, while families can enjoy hours of fun at Shoreline Segway. Time should also be taken to visit Faulkner&#8217;s Island Lighthouse, Elisha Pitkin House and Thomas Burgis II House during a trip to Guilford, while Lake Quonnipaug is one of the most beautiful places to chill out in the area. "
St Ives,"In the 20th century St Ives evolved from a fishing harbour to possibly England&#8217;s prettiest seaside resort. This has much to do with the abundance of heavenly beaches close by. The choice is almost dumbfounding, but Porthminster and Porthmeor and their soft golden sands and natural seascapes are the cream. St Ives&#8217; fishing heritage makes the resort all the quainter: You can still see the colourful fishing vessels pulling in and out the  harbour, and on the winding cobbled alleys in the town are twee old shops and inns to investigate. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, you have culture too, as town became an artists&#8217; colony in the 1930s. There&#8217;s a fantastic Barbara Hepworth sculpture garden and a branch of the Tate Museum, as well as independent galleries to potter around "
"Porth beach, Newquay, Cornwall","For most people the name &#8220;Newquay&#8221; immediately conjures images of surfing. This is surf central for the UK, blessed with six superb beaches for riding waves. But the reason for Newquay&#8217;s fame is the Fistral, with a beach break that causes tall, hollow waves that will test the skills of seasoned surfers and give newcomers the ideal intro to the sport. Much of Newquay is geared towards surfing, but with seven miles of sandy coastline there&#8217;s a lot more to the resort. You can bring littler beachgoers to play on the calmer bays, go on steam train trips and befriend the animals at Newquay or Dairyland Farm World. Couple meanwhile can stay at cute bed &amp; breakfasts, take scenic walks and the sublime Elizabethan Trerice House. "
Lost Gardens of Heligan,"Like the best towns in Cornwall, St Austell has hilly, scurrying lanes enticing you to explore. China Clay was the big industry here in the 1800s, and embedded in a former clay pit is the Eden Project, a mind-blowing botanical project that was unveiled for the new millennium. There are two sensational geodesic biomes, one sustaining rainforest plants and the other a Mediterranean environment. And if you plan ahead you could be here for the Eden Sessions, a series of summer concerts welcoming some big names in rock and pop, like Brian Wilson, the Flaming Lips, PJ Harvey and Sigur Rós. Much older are the Lost Gardens of Heligan, around the 17th-century Heligan house and cherished for their enormous rhododendron  and camellia bushes. "
"Penzance, Cornwall","As England&#8217;s most westerly town Penzance has had a lot of maritime visitors, some friendly, some not so much, like Barbary corsairs or foreign fleets like the Spanish Armada in 1595. It&#8217;s a handsome port, with lot of granite-built regency and Georgian architecture. Check out Chapel Street, with its Egyptian House from the 1830s, or the sleek art deco Jubilee Pool Lido from 1835. And, whether you watch you watch a production or just take a tour the Minack Theatre, cut from the granite cliffs in the 1930s, is a spectacle in its own right. In Penzance&#8217;s balmier climes there are Cornish palms on the streets, and an astonishing choice of subtropical gardens to visit. Tanglewood, Trengwainton and Morrab are musts, but you should also keep the National Dahlia Collection in mind. "
Falmouth,"Lots of things contribute to Falmouth&#8217;s fame as holiday getaway. First is the Fal River estuary, widening into the third-deepest natural harbour on the planet. You can&#8217;t beat this place for hikes,  and on the water you can hop from village to village on boat trips that you&#8217;ll remember all your life. Then there&#8217;s the town&#8217;s harbour, where daring round the world voyages have been launched and where the American fleet was based in the Second World War. All of this is documented at the National Maritime Museum, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. There&#8217;s the enchanting Trebah Garden, family-friendly beaches, quirky shops and Henry VIII&#8217;s coastal fortress, Pendennis Castle. "
"Bude, Cornwall","In the far north of Cornwall, Bude is like Newquay as it faces the Celtic Sea, which is essentially the Atlantic Ocean. The two main beaches, Crooklets and Summerleaze, are broad, windswept and have awesome conditions for surfing on the right days. Summerleaze has sweet pastel-painted beach huts as well as the Bude Sea Pool, which is replenished at  high tide and gives you safe salt-water swimming. There&#8217;s a bunch of other phenomenal beaches along the coast, while the wild scenery will inspire the adventurer in you. The highest sea cliffs in Cornwall could hardly be closer, and epic sandstone rock formations like these are a honeypot for climbers, hikers and even people intrigued by their unusual geological composition. "
Truro,"A dinky city, Truro is smaller than many market towns but doesn&#8217;t suffer for its size. The cultivated Georgian and Victorian architecture in the centre dates to the time tin mining was a way of life, putting Truro on the map as the centre of political power. The cathedral was built at this time, in the gothic revival style at the end of the 19th century, and is pretty unusual for having three spires. Apart from dawdling around the cute shopping streets like Cathedral Lane and St Mary&#8217;s Street, you can have a peek at the Royal Cornwall Museum in a fine Palladian hall. For a city, local activities are very rural, like open farms, boat trips, country parks, cider presses and breweries. "
Lanhydrock House,"In tin-mining country at the heart of Cornwall, Bodmin&#8217;s streets are furnished with bold granite architecture funded by this historic industry. The County Court in its neoclassical splendour conveys Bodmin&#8217;s standing in centuries past. One creepy attraction you have to see is Bodmin Jail, dating to the 1700s and innovative in the sense that it was the first institution to put prisoners in separate cells. Take the tour, which informs you about the ghosts claimed to haunt these walls, as well the First World War, when the crown jewels and Domesday Book were stored for safekeeping. A more polished day out can be had at the Pencarrow or Lanhydrock House, two beautiful country piles. "
Stairway to Tintagel Castle,"The mysterious and wild coast of north Cornwall is a place conducive to legends, and these don&#8217;t come more romantic than King Arthur. Tintagel Castle, a beautiful 13th-century ruin balanced precariously on rocks, is the birthplace of the mythical king. The setting is epic, with &#8220;Merlin&#8217;s Cave&#8221;, &#8220;Rocky Valley&#8221;, dark cliffs and grassy slopes and it&#8217;s not hard to see how people&#8217;s imaginations might run wild in such a place. In the village, take in the Old Post Office, a delightful granite building from the 1300s, or the Norman Church of St Materiana, which has a Roman milestone inside. "
Mevagissey,"A lovably quaint village on the Roseland Heritage Coast, Mevagissey still has a small fleet of fishing boats departing and returning to the unusual double harbour laden with sole, turbot and lobster. The inner quaysides are medieval, while the outer harbour walls are from the 18th century. Fishing trips and ferry rides to outlying villages are the order of the day in Mevagissey. But you need to give yourself time to look around the this place, which has a tangle of streets that wind up the green hillsides, fabulous seafood restaurants and lots of tempting shops. "
Polperro,"Tucked into a rocky inlet on the Polperro Heritage Coast, this gorgeous little port has an in famous history. Ever since Polperro took shape in the 1100s smuggling was rife here, but the activity peaked in the 1700s while Britain was fighting in America and in the Napoleonic Wars. The Heritage Museum of Smuggling &amp; Fishing by the water will highlight the tricks of the trade and characters involved. You can amble around Polperro window shopping at one-off shops and art studios, or set off on a more purposeful walk over craggy shoreline on the way to Polruan via the Southwest Coast Path. Some of Polperro&#8217;s fishing vessels will also take you out of the harbour to get a better look at the coast, spot basking sharks or go fishing. "
Padstow,"Food-lovers come to Padstow for some of the best seafood restaurants in Cornwall. If you value food provenance you&#8217;ll be thrilled by the way these restaurants are connected to Padstow&#8217;s working fishing port, ensuring quality and freshness. And it&#8217;s also worthwhile to just plonk yourself here on a sunny day and watch the activity around the port and observe an industry that has almost disappeared from Britain. You can check out the conservation work being done by the National Lobster Hatchery, head off along the coast to discover unspoiled beaches, or wander by the River Camel Estuary, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. "
"Old Mine Works, Redruth","We&#8217;ve mentioned tin mining a few times, and if you want to grasp exactly what this industry meant to Cornwall for hundreds of years Redruth could be your best option. Here you can enter the East Pool Mine, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site protecting Cornwall and Devon&#8217;s mining legacy. This mine operated from the 1700s to 1945, and the amount of antique machinery, including two beam engines and an intact engine house, is an eye-opener. In the countryside, Wheal Pinvor is a ruined mine slowly being reclaimed by nature, while Gwennap Pit is a strange phenomenon, a terraced amphitheatre fashioned by mining subsidence up to the 1700s. "
Boscastle,"Despite being a small coastal village, Boscastle is pleasure to wander around because it stretches out a long way beside its natural harbour. There&#8217;s the combined allure of old fishing cottages and inns, together with the rocky green hills that bank sharply from the water. At the entrance to the harbour on a spectacular promontory is the Lookout, built first as a summer house by the local landowner and then used as an observation point to combat smugglers. Further back, where the harbour is just a narrow channel, is a National Trust cafe and the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic, with what might be the largest hoard of ritual magic artefacts in the world. "
"Looe, Cornwall","In a county of adorable fishing ports, Looe is one of the most adorable of all and still has a fleet of fishing boats. Get up early for the fish auction first thing in the morning on the quayside, or try catching your own seafood by going crabbing on the old harbour wall. For littler members of the family the Monkey Sanctuary recues woolly monkeys and  eventually returns them to the Amazon. There&#8217;s a diverting museum in the town&#8217;s guildhall, and you can board a boat for St George&#8217;s Island, which was a hotbed of smuggling in the 1600s and 1700s. "
"Arenal, Costa Rica","Soaring more than 1,600 meters above the jungles of Alajuela north out of San Jose, the Arenal Volcano remains arguably Costa Rica’s biggest draw. A mecca for outdoorsy types, the whole area around the colossal mount is dotted with roaring waterfalls (not least of all the wonderful La Fortuna falls), crisscrossed by countless hiking trails and bridle paths, cut through by frothing river rapids ripe for whitewater rafting, and home to swinging wire bridges that offer close-up encounters with the toucans and sloths of the rainforest canopies. Careful though – Arenal is still one of the most active calderas in all of Central America! "
Monteverde,"The domain of the revered cloud forests is an absolute must for any first-time travelers making their way through Costa Rica. Perched high atop the plateaus and peaks of the Cordillera de Tilarán, little Monteverde makes its home right in the midst of the misty montane woods. Stalking jaguars, elusive pumas, elegant ocelots, colourful toucans, sloths, spider monkeys and countless critters in the undergrowth all inhabit the trunks and canopies here, making intrepid excursions in the orchid-dotted, primeval wilds all the more enthralling. Zip lining and night safaris are also on the menu, while nearby Santa Elena offers most all of the backpacker infrastructure. "
Sunset in Tamarindo,"Sun-splashed Tamarindo draws big crowds with its line-up of sparkling Pacific beaches and palpable Tico charm. Located on the northern edge of the Nicoya Peninsula, the town boasts its very own three-kilometer stretch of sand. Leatherback turtles creep and crawl the coastline along the shore too (Playa Grande is best known for this), while a medley of marlin and giant tuna pull sports fishermen, and the surf swells entice board riders right throughout the year. Add to that a smattering of great hotels and backpacker guesthouses, laid-back beach bars, and access to pretty much all of the breathtaking national parks of Guanacaste &#8211; Palo Verde, Rincon de la Vieja et al – and it’s easy to see why this one’s a must! "
Corcovado National Park,"Unquestionably one of the most coveted natural landscapes for travelers making their way through the backcountry of Costa Rica, the Corcovado National Park is the jewel in the crown of the salt-sprayed, jungle-clad Osa Peninsula. Nestled deep in the south of the country, away from the trodden surfer swells and beach resorts, this land of tapirs and anteaters, sloths and squirrel monkeys, coloured macaws and majestic margay cats has a clutch of wild camp grounds and ranger shelters for intrepid visitors. Trails like the popular El Tigre offer some of the top wildlife spotting, while the waters between the shore and rugged Isla del Caño in the Pacific promise sightings of killer whales and dolphins! "
Puerto Viejo de Talamanca Beach,"Now set to a backing track of Bob Marley and the Wailers, Puerto Viejo de Talamanca is a totally transformed fishing village that hosts everyone from snowbirds to surfers amidst its beach shacks and seaside cocktail bars. The nearby waves of Salsa Brava are hailed as some of the most gnarly barrels on the eastern coast of Costa Rica as a whole, bringing in professional wave riders for the competitions and wide-eyed onlookers to the cliffs by the bucket load. There’s a charming Carib-Creole character to the town too, as Ticos brew up bubbling jambalaya on the street sides and the smells of coffee and cocoa drift down from the nearby jungles. "
"Plaza de la Cultura, San Jose","A great many travelers making their way to Costa Rica will pass through or even touch down in the capital of San Jose. And while many gloss over the 260,000-strong metropolis, making a beeline straight for the Pacific or Carib coasts, those who stay are in for a real treat. Nestled deep in the verdant hills of the Central Valley, San Jose has only reigned as first city since the early 19th century. Still, it’s got its fair share of pretty colonial churches and Baroque facades thanks to its Spanish roots and onetime coffee tycoons (check out the beautiful Plaza España and nearby Barrio Amón), not to mention leafy parks where yogis gather in the morning, museums packed with the exquisite golden artifacts of South America’s pre-Columbian peoples, and a lively student-led nightlife in San Pedro after dark! "
Alajuela &#8211; Traditional hand-painted oxen cart,"Oddly left untrodden by many travelers touching down on the nearby runways of San Jose, Alajuela is a fascinating colonial city (the second largest in all of Costa Rica in fact) that makes its home amidst the verdant rising peaks of the impossibly beautiful Central Valley. Steeped in history and with a proud political past, the center rose to fame as a staunch hotpot for revolutionary and patriotic sentiment (just check out the much-loved local hero, Juan Santamaría, who almost singlehandedly caused the retreat of the maverick filibusterer William Walker in 1856). The middle of the city is a sleepy medley of elegant Baroque facades (be sure to see the beautiful La Agonía church), while the mighty peaks of the Poas Volcano dominate the horizon – one of the top spots for crater viewing in the world! "
"Manuel Antonio National Park, Costa Rica","Parakeets and parrots chirp and sing over the turquoise-blue waters of Espadilla Sur and Teloro – two of the most gorgeous beaches in all of Costa Rica. These are found set deep within the protected enclave of the Manuel Antonio National Park, backed by thick groves of silk cotton trees and bay cedars, the distinct silhouettes of howler monkeys and white-headed capuchins swinging from bough to bough within. Couple those gorgeous Pacific vistas and the booming biodiversity with some of the most accessible trails of all Costa Rica’s protected areas, and it’s easy to see why this humble section of coastal Puntarenas is the country’s second most-visited national park! "
"Surfer &#8211; Jacó, Costa Rica","As the condominiums continue to rise and the perfectly-formed rollers of the Pacific continue to magnetise more long-haired surfers looking to tick off the fabled beach breaks and rocky left-turners of Roca Loca and Playa Jacó, it’s hardly surprising that this erstwhile fishing village, nestled just over the peaks of the Cordillera de Tilarán from San Jose, remains one of Costa Rica’s most visited spots. Granted the late-night discos and perpetual talk of shredding the swells isn’t for everyone, but there’s still real beauty to be found amidst the rugged mountain-backed coves and beaches around town. And if it’s a classic Pacific beach holiday you’re after, rounded off with hedonistic discos and oodles of guaro sour cocktail bars, Jacó is just the spot! "
"Santa Teresa, Costa Rica","Coconut palms explode like grass-green Jigglypuffs over the blanket-white sands of Mal País. Meanwhile, Playa Carmen is a wind-buffeted picture of tropical perfection, the tendrils of ocean vines clambering over the sand to the perfectly-formed beach breaks of the shore. Then there’s the fish shacks and romantic sunsets of Playa Hermosa just to the north, not to mention beautiful Santa Teresa itself, a hub for all things surfer and sea. Welcome to Costa Rica’s Pacific beach town par excellence. Today, this entire stretch of the Nicoya Peninsula is famed for its chilled-out vibes and gorgeous coastline, which gel perfectly well with all the yogis, Rasta types and New Age organicos occupying the health resorts in the hills nearby! "
Anhinga in Tortuguero National Park,"Tortuguero National Park is the top spot to see Costa Rica’s endangered sea turtles, with everything from hawksbill to leatherbacks to uber-rare green sea turtles creeping up onto the sands that line its shores in the spring. And while most visitors come to see this nesting or hatching phenomenon, Tortuguero has other big pulls. Set over a series of wild volcanic islands and marshes, washed over by the Caribbean Sea and dressed in dense mangroves, the protected swathes here also host tropical gar, peacocks, howlers, three-toed sloths and jaguars. Forget hiking though – there’s simply no substitute for exploring the endless rivers and brackish lagoons by boat or canoe. "
Chirripó National Park,"Ranging from the tropical rainforests of the Chirripó lowlands to the montane cloud forests of the Cartago highlands, this 50,000-hectare national park is one of the least-trodden in the country. Sprawled over three different provinces, its center is spiked by the soaring peak of Cerro Chirripó – the highest mountain in Costa Rica at 3,820 meters above sea level. Climbers who aim to conquer this great monolith hit hiking trails that weave through alpine tundra and primeval woods to the summit, where sweeping panoramas of the countless volcanos, both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts and the endless jungle canopies are the reward. Others come to camp in the company of primates and roaring cataracts, secluded mountain lakes and sloths. "
Cartago,"Where once the grand facades of the Spanish crown loomed large, it’s now the serrated tips of the mighty jungle-dressed Cordillera Central that dominate Cartago. Set high on the volcanic ridges in the very heart of the country, this city is hailed as the first ever in Costa Rica, and even reigned as capital for almost three centuries, until San Jose claimed the mantle in 1824. Remnants of this age of glory can still be traced amidst the all-new concrete rows that make up the downtown (a product of major rebuilding after an earthquake in the early 1900s): the crumbling walls of the Santiago Apóstol in the Plaza Mayor; the snow-white domes of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels. Volcanos are never too far away in these parts either – be sure to see the brooding caldera of Irazú, and sample the potent coffees of the Orosi Valley too! "
"Rincon de la Vieja National Park, Costa Rica","The multi-cratered mass of volcanic rock that is the eponymous Rincon de la Vieja Volcano is the piece de resistance of this sprawling national park amidst the wilds of Guanacaste. Accessed from the city of Liberia, the tectonic zone here is considered one of the most active in Costa Rica – smoke and plumes of sulphur regularly issue from the Von Seebach caldera up top! There are also fields of bubbling mud pools and smoking fumaroles peppering the landscape, while primeval forestry erupts on the fertile plains, awash with squawking bellbirds and cougars. "
Montezuma,"A cocktail of the artistic and the outdoorsy, the wild and the luxurious, Montezuma has risen and risen on Costa Rica’s touristic line-up since the days when it was just a sleepy fishing town issuing bobbing timber boats out to catch whitefish in the swells of the Puntarenas Pacific. Today, yoga retreats and eco lodges hide in the hills, surf shacks and surf schools cling like limpets to the rocks around the popular swells at Sunset Reef and Montezuma Bay, cocktail bars masquerade as salt-washed beach shacks and refined eateries appear in the guise of street-side holes-in-the-wall. Few cars and little infrastructure mean Montezuma retains its rustic edge too, making it a fine place for some R&amp;R on the west coast! "
"Durham, England","With twisting cobblestone streets and volumes of history it&#8217;s hard not to be overwhelmed by the extraordinary City of Durham. You may find yourself extending your stay just to make sure you make every discovery, because there&#8217;s an incredible amount to get through. Start with the cathedral, up there with England&#8217;s most valued monuments and overflowing with vital fragments of early English history in its library and treasury. The other pillar of Durham&#8217;s World Heritage Site is the castle, erected right after the Norman Conquest and with student volunteers from Durham University giving informative tours. Dawdle along the riverside, browse the fabulous museums and get out to the wonderful North Sea coast. "
Darlington Market Hall,"The first steam-powered passenger trains in the world chugged along the Stockton and Darlington Railway from 1825, so this market town has reason to be proud of its contribution to the world . Head of Steam is a railway museum at the North Road station George Stephenson&#8217;s Locomotion No. 1, the first engine on the line looks as good as new. Darlington&#8217;s Covered Market is in an impressive hall with an iron frame, that was completed in 1863 and has stalls that have been passed down through families for generations. Pop in from Monday to Saturday for flowers, fruit and veg, meat, cakes and much more besides. "
Hartlepool Maritime Experience,"The story of this coastal town echoes that of many next to the North Sea. Hartlepool was just a small place until railways and industrialisation arrived in the 1800s. Within decades it was one of the most productive fishing ports and shipyards in the region, bringing in fresh fish and raw fleeces and sending it west to Yorkshire and Lancashire&#8217;s woollen mills regions, while exporting coal and textiles. So the old waterfront is an apt setting for Hartlepool&#8217;s Maritime Experience. Moored here is HMS Tricomalee, the oldest British warship still afloat and celebrating its 200th anniversary in 2017. The Hartlepool Museum on the quayside has the world&#8217;s first gas-powered lighthouse, and will also explain why Hartlepudlians refer to themselves as &#8220;Monkey Hangers&#8221;. "
Bishop Auckland,"This town got its name because of Auckland Castle, a hunting lodge that the Bishops of Durham chose for a residence more than 800 years ago. Even now Auckland Castle is a functioning episcopal palace in more than 320 hectares of parkland, in which you&#8217;ll stumble upon a variety of interesting little monuments. Take the stone Deer House, constructed in the a gothic revival style in 1760 to give the park&#8217;s deer food and shelter. Bishop Auckland&#8217;s Victorian town hall became obsolete and was threatened with demolition, but it has since been revived as a cultural centre with a theatre, art gallery and cinema. And, a little way outside the town are the remains of Vinovia a Roman fort, which includes one of the most complete hypocausts in the Roman Britain. "
Bowes Museum,"Found on the north bank of the River Tees in the eastern foothills of the Pennines, Barnard Castle is a small town that will blow you away with its culture. For this you can thank Bowes Museum, which holds what is the greatest collection of art and decorative items in the North of England. We&#8217;re talking El Greco, Canaletto, van Dyck, Fragonard and Goya along with a veritable treasure chest of tapestries, furniture and ceramics. An astounding exhibit is the Silver Swan, a clockwork automaton crafted in the 1700s. The town has some wonderfully picturesque ruins, including the eponymous castle, put up by the Normans in the 1100s in a lordly spot over the Tees, and Egglestone Abbey, built around the same time and dissolved by Henry VIII in the 1500s. "
North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,"Most of western Durham is a remote natural area on the northern limit of the Pennines Range. This land of heather moors, hay meadows, broad valleys cut by powerful rivers may seem unaffected by man, but there clues all through the area of human intervention, both ancient and recent. You can hike to Bronze Age burial mounds and see the vestiges of historic lead mines, and tucked into the open scenery are the old and pretty villages that would have houses these mining communities. "
Chester-le-Street,"In the 10th century something momentous took place at the spot where the Church of St Mary and St Cuthbert stands today: A priest named Aldred the Scribe produced the earliest ever translation of the gospels to English, and in this period the church was the centre of Christianity for a area of what is now northeastern England and Scotland. The current 11th century church is certainly regal, and marking in the walls show that Roman stone was used in parts of its construction. Next to the Wear River is the Riverside Ground, where Durham County cricket team play their matches, and also hosting a five-day test match between England and a touring nation each summer. "
"Seaham, England","The landscape at this coastal town is as rugged and windswept as you would hope from a north sea setting. On crisp wintry days there&#8217;s a raw majesty to the sea and the limestone cliffs, and you can feel the force of the elements on the coastal path before warming up at a pub. And when the weather&#8217;s warmer the North Beach becomes very tempting; this is guarded from the sea by a breakwater and has little rock pools to paddle in. The Church of St Mary the Virgin is fascinating, as it has an Anglo-Saxon nave that has been dated to the late-600s, which puts it among the 20 oldest churches in the UK. "
Beamish Museum,"A short way west of Newcastle in gorgeous upland countryside is this village, attached to one of the northeast&#8217;s most cherished visitor attractions. The Beamish Museum is an outdoor heritage museum on a bewildering scale. It&#8217;s so large that you&#8217;re encouraged to take vintage trams and buses to get around. There&#8217;s an Edwardian town, with machinery, signage, architecture and amenities from around 1913, and a farm that is frozen in the 1940s, complete with tools and machinery from that era. The Georgian North recreates a farm from 1825, where you can meet regional domestic breeds and check out a waggonway, horse-drawn transport on rails that was replaced by steamtrains. Both locations are in a beautiful steep-sided valley and have a whole cast of re-enactors "
"Church of St Thomas, Stanhope","By the River Wear in the heart of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Stanhope is a serene place and a handy spot if you&#8217;d like to plot a course into the marvellous landscape of hills and dales. The Durham Dales Visitor Centre, next to the Church of St Thomas, will set you up with itineraries and path guides. And you can also learn about some of the minor sights around the town. For instance, you don&#8217;t need to be a palaeobotanist to be wowed by Stanhope&#8217;s fossil tree. What you see in the town&#8217;s churchyard is a 320 million-year-old tree stump found in a sandstone quarry just outside the town in 1915. "
"Holy Trinity, Stockton-on-Tees","This market town was the eastern terminus for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and in its boomtown days was another of the Northeast&#8217;s big shipbuilders. But its most famous contribution to the world was the friction match, invented by a local chemist in 1827. Preston Park is a huge green space to the southwest of the town, with attractions that have recently been given a makeover. The museum in the stately Preston Park Hall has wide-ranging exhibits of old stagecoaches, armour and art, and also offers a window on daily life and industry in Stockton 200 years ago. Butterfly World in the park is a heated glasshouse with exotic butterfly species flying free in tropical vegetation. "
Middleton-in-Teesdale,"Teesdale is prized for its heartrending upland scenery and natural landmarks. And Middleton, also in the North Pennines, is within walking distance of one of the River Tees&#8217; wildest spectacles. High Force Waterfall is a challenging but unforgettable hike against  the craggy course of  the river. High Force may not be the tallest waterfall in the country, but when the river is in full flow it does have the highest volume of water falling over an unbroken drop. You&#8217;ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to walks in Middleton: The epic, 267-mile Pennine Way trail passes through, and looming above the south of the village is Kirkcarrion a hill topped with a Bronze Age barrow where a chieftain is said to be buried. "
Shildon Locomotion Museum,"A former East Durham mining town, Shildon  grew quickly in the late-1700s and would have transported its coal via the wagonways that you can see at the Beamish museum. But as the industry expanded steam power took over, and it&#8217;s no stretch to say that Shildon is the &#8220;Cradle of the Railways&#8221;. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was essentially built and maintained by the Shildon Works. Although they&#8217;re now gone, the Shildon Locomotion Museum opened in 2004 where the works used to be. The attraction combines a modern building with old workshops and sheds, and even the home of Timothy Hackworth, an engineer and innovator in the early years at the Shildon Works. Hackworth&#8217;s Sans Pareil locomotive from 1829 is one of the stars, and took part in the Rainhill Trials to work out which engine would run the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. "
Durham Heritage Coast,"With coal mining and other heavy industry long gone, nature has reclaimed parts of Durham that had been forgotten by holidaymakers. And this is true of the coastline from Sunderland to Hartlepool, which has now qualified for Heritage Coast Status. Apart from Seaham there are no resorts to speak of, so you find yourself in an unadulterated, craggy seascape made for rambling. The Coastal Footpath hugs the North Sea shoreline, scaling rousing limestone cliffs and guiding you to spectacular promontories like Noses Point, or the remote and haunting beach at Shippersea Bay. "
Escomb Saxon Church,"Earlier we mentioned the Roman fort at Vinovia near Bishop Auckland. Well, an intriguing thing about that monument is that in the 7th century much of its stone was transported to what is now the village of Escomb on the River Wear. And here it became the material for what may well be the oldest complete church in the country, and one of only three Anglo-Saxon churches still standing in England. Amateur historians will get frissons inspecting the stonework, which bears Roman inscriptions and  a sundial on the south wall. "
Pula,"Dressed in Roman marble and sparkling against the aquamarine hues of the Adriatic, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-pula-croatia/"">Pula</a> is the jewel at the end of the Istrian Peninsula. It rose to glory under the auspices of Augustus Caesar, and the mighty amphitheatre that still stands on the edge of the ancient old town (arguably the best preserved Roman relic outside of Italy) was raised while the Julio-Claudians still reigned supreme in Rome. Today the 2,000-year-old centre is interspersed with charming Venetian buildings and traces of Slavic and Byzantine rule, all coalescing around the lively beer bars and konobas (traditional Croatian eateries) of the city Forum. Then there are the rugged cliff-backed coves and sun-splashed terraces that line the Verudela headland on the edge of town; picture-perfect examples of Croatia’s glorious Mediterranean coast. "
Korcula Island,"It’s no secret that most travelers make a beeline to this sunny Adriatic island to wonder at the delights of its postcard-perfect old town, which perches over the rollers of the Med on the eastern coast, complete with a set of striking medieval towers and bulwarks and meticulously-planned breeze-kissed streets. However, head away from this marble-clad magnet of a town and you’ll discover a backcountry worth writing home about, where undulating forests of Spanish pine cascade down to secluded coves of pearly-white pebbles, where rustic fish restaurants dot the coastal paths and catamarans bob above the blue-green sea. "
Dubrovnik,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-dubrovnik-croatia/"">Dubrovnik</a> rises between the half-baked limestone ridges of the Dalmatian Coast and the perfect blue of the Adriatic Sea; a ring of stone-built fortifications and a dash of red-tiled roofs that’s hailed by many as the most fascinating city in all of Croatia. All the action centres on the beautiful, UNESCO-attested Old Town, where the Gothic edifices of Sponza Palace tower over the bustling boutiques and cafes on the central drag of Placa Stradun. Tours around the crumbling city bulwarks are really popular, while others come to seek out the filming spots used in HBO’s Game of Thrones. There’s also Lapad Beach for a spot of sunbathing, and the much-vaunted Dubrovnik Cable Car for sweeping views over the city and the coast. "
Zagreb,"Far away from the hotspots of the Dalmatian and Istrian coasts, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-zagreb-croatia/"">Croatia’s capital</a> sits nestled at the foot of the rugged Medvednica massif in the northern inland belt. An ancient city, Zagreb really only found its feet in the 19th and 20th centuries, when a great revival in Illyrian neoclassicism and Slavic art imbued the centre with the wealth of grandiose municipal buildings and Baroque spires still seen today. More recently and the enchanting Gornji Grad district has become a favourite amongst tourists in search of interesting churches and plazas thronged with local street performers during the summer. Oh, and then there’s the students and their concomitant nightlife; bubbling up every evening in the al fresco bars of Tkalciceva Street. "
Rovinj,"Encompassed by the lapping waves of the Adriatic midway up the rugged Istrian coast, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-rovinj-croatia/"">Rovinj</a> juts its way out into the waters like a sparkling jewel chiselled and carved by the hands of Romans, Venetians, Franks and Hapsburg Austrians alike. The gorgeous old town heart is flanked by stretches of pebbly beach and ringed by a sun-splashed walkway where locals laze during the summer. Above, the needle-like spire of whitewashed St Euphemia&#8217;s Basilica provides the perfect compass point, helping visitors navigate between the hidden squares, flapping washing lines, aromatic pizzerias and narrow lanes that abound. "
Hvar,"Hedonistic <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-hvar-croatia/"">Hvar</a> town and its fun-loving following of students, Club Med types and coffee-culture-mad locals makes plenty of noise from its seat at the end of its eponymous island on the edge of the Dalmatian Coast. Yes sir, this pretty spot is home to a sun-splashed harbourside (known locally as the Riva), where cabana bars and open-air cocktail joints rumble until the early hours next to bobbing millionaire yachts. Meanwhile, the winding marble-stone streets of the Stari Grad offer oodles of refined konobas, where mezze plates of Croatian olive oils mix with truffle pastas and the like. And when you can pull yourself away from the city, the hiking trails and beaches beckon, hitting their peak with secluded coves and pine-shrouded paths on the Pakleni Islands nearby. "
Mljet Island,"Wild, rugged and untouched, Mljet remains the Adriatic island of choice for travelers in search of the real coastal Croatia. It comes clad in a thick coat of woodland, steeped in ancient Greek legends (a cave on the south coast is supposedly where Odysseus held up for six years!) and peppered with the occasional cellar door where tanned locals cultivate their own vineyards between the pines. However, the piece de resistance of this sun-splashed isle has to be the designated Mljet National Park on the eastern tip; a picturesque swathe of coastal forests where the Veliko and Malo salt lakes carve through the landscape and a majestic Benedictine Monastery draws the eye. "
Plitvice National Park,"Chiselled and carved out of the limestone bluffs, chalk cliffs and dolomite escarpments of central Croatia, where the rugged Dinaric Alps rise to form the borderlands with Bosnia to the east, the legendary Plitvice lakes and their eponymous national park really are all they’re cracked up to be! They are set amidst verdant valleys clothed in spruce, fir, beech and hornbeam, and can be seen gushing and flowing in a series of breathtaking waterfalls from the various winding walking tracks and boardwalks now open to visitors. Plitvice is actually one of the oldest national parks on the continent, and still plays host to wild wolf packs, Croatian brown bears, curious wood grouses and elusive lynxes. "
Motovun,"Peaking above the clouds as they descend into the rugged inland valleys of central Istria, Motovun is unquestionably one of the most elegant and alluring villages in the country. It can be found draped over a pyramid-shaped hill above the Mirna River; a symphony of terracotta roofs and stony streets that gives way to rolling fields of olive groves and truffle-packed forest (something this town is particularly famed for). Today, travellers head in to wander along the old Venetian bulwarks, weave through the wine cellars and sample some of the best pasta and pizza dishes in the country, all in the company of uber-friendly, Italian-speaking locals. "
Split,"Famed as the home of the totemic UNESCO World Heritage Site of Diocletian’s Palace, Split’s near perfect balance of the old and the new makes it unquestionably one of the country’s most alluring towns. The 4th century remnants of Diocletian’s creation occupy the very heart of the city, and come interspersed with the occasional Gothic tower from a later age (or Egyptian sphinx from an earlier one!). The history spreads underground too, with vaulted subterranean rooms showing the true extent of the ancient site. However, it’s not all Roman relics in Split. No sir, not with that sun-kissed Riva promenade and Bacvice cove beckoning from the peripheries, awash with beach bars and swish cocktail joints. "
Zadar,"The capital of the much-trodden Dalmatian region is everything you’d expect of a sun-splashed Croatian resort town on the edge of the Adriatic: at once lively and laid-back, steeped in history yet perennially modern. In fact, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-zadar-croatia/"">Zadar</a> is known for its good mix of old and new, boasting the elegant Byzantine rises of St Donat&#8217;s Church next to the crumbling remnants of a Roman Forum and crisscrossing lanes of cafes and eateries. The so-called Sea Organ by architect-artist Nikola Basic also draws crowds with its light shows and curious science, while there’s a certain allure to the way Zadar just seems to slip into the Mediterranean, making it easy for locals and travelers alike to cool off in the sea. "
Zagorje near Lobor,"Closer to the Slavic hinterlands of Slovenia and Hungary than the sun-kissed Croatian riviera, off-the-beaten-track Zagorje remains a true diamond in the rough on the Republic’s touristic line-up. Rarely visited but loved fervently by those who do come, this land of rolling hills and seemingly endless farm fields is at once rustic, earthy and real. Influenced heavily by Austria and Slovenia to the north, the area is peppered with the occasional Baroque fortress, or towns like Krapina, where local dialects still reign supreme. Then – of course – there’s the wine, production of which stems back to Roman times, while vineyards and cellar doors occupy the valley sides ad infinitum. "
Waterfall in Krka National Park,"The shimmering and crashing waterfalls and lakes of Krka are something like the southern counterpart to Plitvice. They range from the crumbling karsts and escarpments of the Dinaric Alps to the ria of Skradinski, where the river waters become brackish and join with the Adriatic Sea. Of course, the main attraction here has to be the series of cataracts that dot the park, many of which are the product of centuries of hyper algae growth between the banks of the mineral-rich Krka River, while other pulls include the enchanting sight of the Visovac Monastery, which just pokes above the trees on an island in the midst of mirror-like Visovac Lake. "
Rijeka,"A cocktail of blue-collar port life, elegant Habsburg nostalgia and the laid-back vibes of coastal Croatia, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-rijeka-croatia/"">Rijeka</a> can be found nestled on the Istrian panhandle, pulling in ship after ship across the deep waters of the Kvarner Gulf. In fact, it was Rijeka’s close connection to the sea and these vital shipping lanes that shaped it into the city it is today, with centuries spent oscillating between Habsburg and Hungarian, gathering glorious adornments like the Governor’s Palace and Rijeka Cathedral as it went. The city is also now famed as the home of Rijeka Carnival, which draws more than 100,000 people to see parades and curious ceremonies take place on bustling Korzo Street at the heart of town. "
Varazdin,"Don’t worry if you’ve not heard of Varazdin. Few have. And that’s despite its illustrious past as one of Croatia’s former capitals and a regal Hungarian stronghold besides! Still, travelers who do make their way to this far-flung city on the edge of Slovenia are in for a real treat. It’s a place where some of Europe’s most elegant and best-preserved Baroque towers and frontispieces meet to form one truly handsome Stari Grad district, where the whitewashed rises of Varazdin Castle reveal interesting historical tales of medieval power struggles, and where sun-kissed plazas lined with rococo and Gothic revival builds play host to Austrian-flavoured eateries and beer halls alike.

Lake District,"England&#8217;s highest mountain, Scafell Pike is in the west of the Lake District and there are scores of hills, known as &#8216;fells&#8217; for hardy walkers to test their mettle. The lakes themselves are magnificent finger-like sheets of reflective waters. The largest of them, Windermere and Ullswater, are crossed by pleasure boats and ferries, and most are watersports heaven. In the evenings you can crash in adorable villages and towns like Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere, which have catered to the whims of tourists for hundreds of years. There aren&#8217;t many regions in the world as intrinsically linked with a person as the Lake District is with the poet William Wordsworth. He lived here all his life and has fixed the lakes and fells in the imagination of his readers for 200 years now. "
Keswick,"If you&#8217;re weary after a day of hiking in the fells you couldn&#8217;t hope for a better spot to crash than the historic market town of Keswick. There&#8217;s a large roll-call of pubs and restaurants for warming meals in the evenings, and charming streets with cute shops to welcome you back to civilisation. The town is a sort of base camp for rugged outdoors types, close to the head of Derwent water and in the shadow of Cat Bells, one of the Lake District&#8217;s most treasured walking spots. Honister Slate Mine has been producing slate for almost 300 years, and you can go to look around the nave-like tunnels and cross a via ferrata. "
Ambleside,"At the northern shore of the mighty Windermere, Ambleside is a Lake District town to fall in love with at first sight. Many of the Victorian stone-built houses are hotels and bed &amp; breakfasts for outbound hikers, or people out to recharge their batteries floating on Windermere by steamer or under their own power. If you&#8217;re a hiker you&#8217;ve come to the right place, because you can conquer the stunning Loughrigg Fell on a circular trail right from the edge Ambleside. A raft of historic figures have lived or worked in this town, and the Armitt Museum has exhibits about Ambleside&#8217;s ties to William Wordsworth and children&#8217;s author Beatrix Potter. "
Carlisle,"The only city in the county is a few miles shy of the Scottish border and has a good helping of history and culture. Tullie House Museum is vital for its pre-Raphaelite art, Roman finds and natural history exhibits, all in a stunning old mansion. The city&#8217;s cathedral is the second smallest in the country, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not worth your time. It was actually adapted from a monastic church and has a breathtaking Gothic east window and choir stalls carved in the 1400s. Carlisle was originally the largest settlement on Hadrian&#8217;s Wall, so you can pick up the course of this great frontier here. "
Coniston,"If you&#8217;re ready to hit the fells, Coniston is a fantastic choice. The bulky Old Man of Coniston looms over the little town and conducts you to the summit 400 metres up via easy-to-follow trails. Coniston Water is sublime of course, and has adventure sport companies waiting to take you out on canoe and sailing trips. One of Victorian Britain&#8217;s most influential thinkers, John Ruskin, spent the last few years of his life in Coniston. His handsome manor house, Brantwood, is a visitor attraction gazing out over Coniston Water and there&#8217;s a compact but enlightening museum in his honour in the town. Make time for Tarn Hows, a magical little lake at the foot of steep wooded hills. "
Penrith Castle,"Always flirting with the Scottish border, Penrith&#8217;s location lent it massive strategic importance for almost 2,000 years. The Roman fort of Voreda is minutes north of the town, while Penrith Castle dates to the turn of the 15th century and was built to defend against Scottish raids. But there is also history of a less belligerent kind at the romantic towers of Lowther Castle and the cultivated Dalemain Estate, which has an award-winning garden. You can journey to the Bronze Age at Long Meg and Her Daughters, a stone circle started 5,000 years ago. Or come to experience nature in all its majesty at the Aira Force waterfall, which plunges 20 metres and was adored by Wordsworth. "
Kendal Castle,"A southern springboard for the Lake District, Kendal is also a tidy little destination of its own. On the streets you&#8217;ll notice that nearly everything is made from grey limestone, which is quarried locally and lends Kendal an air of gravitas. If you&#8217;re up for some sightseeing and visits to historic landmarks, this town obliges with the sensational Sizergh Castle, Levens Hall and the tortured ruins of Kendal Castle high above the River Kent on the east bank. Kendal Museum will flesh out the story of Kendal Castle and how it came to be destroyed, while  on the road to Windermere is the Hawkshead Brewery, a cosy craft operation brewing real ale and providing tours. "
Birdoswald Fort,"Carlisle may have piqued your interest for Hadrian&#8217;s Wall, so there are some superb remnants of the ancient barrier minutes from the little town of Brampton. Birdoswald Fort is unique for being the only stronghold on the wall that was occupied into the Dark Ages. And Willowford Wall is a length of the defence that once incorporated a fortified bridge of the River Irthing and has some of the most complete sections of the wall to be found. In the town you have to seek out St Martin&#8217;s Church, which was designed by the early Arts and Crafts architect Philip Webb and decorated with astonishing stained glass windows. Keep the ruins of Lanercost Priory in mind, and while away a summer&#8217;s day with a line at New Mills Trout Fishing Park. "
Jennings Brewery,"We&#8217;ve mentioned William Wordsworth a few times, and at Cockermouth you can come and see where he was born. The poet&#8217;s childhood home is a fine Georgian townhouse that will transport you back to the 1770s. Kids aren&#8217;t left out, and can play with 18th-century style toys and dress up in replica costumes while outside there&#8217;s an exquisite kitchen garden that looks much as it did when William was honing his craft. You can also go behind the scenes at the Jennings Brewery in Lorton, which has been supplying ale to the Lake District for two centuries, while Banks Ironmongers is a hardware shop open since 1836 and loads of period curiosities. "
Grange-over-Sands,"When you contemplate the vistas of Morecambe Bay from the sweet old resort of Grange-over-Sands it&#8217;s no mystery why textile magnates chose this location for their grand summer houses in the 19th century. The resort has the timelessness of a Lake District village and a hit of fresh sea air. There are old-fashioned local shops to browse, and the stately Holker Hall also imbues the town with some nobility. On the promenade you can wonder at the big skies over the Irish Sea, or you could head next-door to the village of Cartmel, home to a 12th-century priory. "
Sedbergh,"In the southeast of the county, the smart town of Sedbergh is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Main Street will win your heart, where antiques shops, pubs and a variety of speciality stores press in from both sides of this narrow cobbled lane. Peeking between the breaks in the terraced streets are the epic Howgills Fells, which may persuade you to lace up those walking shoes again if you&#8217;re not exhausted yet. Farfield Mill is an engaging little attraction that pairs Victorian textile heritage with arts and crafts workshops. You can also dip into Sedbergh&#8217;s Quaker history at the Bridflatts Meeting House, which is from 1675 and the second oldest Quaker Friends House in Britain. "
Furness Abbey,"At the coastal town of Barrow-in-Furness industry and medieval history sit side-by-side. This is a shipbuilding town that has launched vessels for hundreds of years. Right now it&#8217;s in the business of assembling Britain&#8217;s high-tech Dreadnought-class submarines. For the lowdown on that decorated shipbuilding history the Dock Museum is your go-to attraction, and is built right on top of a Victorian graving dock. Furness Abbey is up there with Britain&#8217;s most romantic monastery ruins, with walls and columns of red sandstone in the hollow of a beautiful green valley. "
Lake Grasmere,"About as central as you can get in the Lake District, Grasmere is a tourist-friendly village that places you in striking distance of all of the heavenly lakes and fells. And it goes without saying that Grasmere takes its name from its own divine lake. Lake Grasmere is as lovely as any in the national park, and the easy path on its perimeter is just right if you&#8217;re daunted by the region&#8217;s high fells. A few steps from the shore is Dove Cottage, where Wordsworth lived for the first few years of the 19th century. And then directly after he married  he moved to the grander Allan Bank, which commands inspirational views of the waters. If you&#8217;re a more ambitious walker, the spellbinding glacial lake, Easdale Tarn is a stiff walk west of the village. "
Stott Park Bobbin Mill,"A well-presented stop on your way in to the Lake District from the south, Ulverston was the birthplace of the legendary comedian Stan Laurel, from the duo Laurel and Hardy. The town has the only museum in the world about the double act, founded by a keen collector who hoarded piles of photos, furniture, props, letters and other memorabilia. Elsewhere, a rare fragment of Cumbria&#8217;s Victorian industry has been safeguarded at the Stott Park Bobbin Mill, which has a horizontal steam engine and gears that still work. At one time there were dozens of these facilities strewn across the Lake District, making bobbins for the vast textile mills in Yorkshire and Lancashire. "
Paphos,"The shimmering, seaside jewel in the Cypriot crown, Paphos hugs the lapping cobalt of the Mediterranean on the breezy south-western haunch of the island. Pretty and tourist-friendly in the extreme, the developed centre here (known locally as Kato Paphos) comes complete with palm-shaded esplanades and bubbling al fresco seafood joints. Bobbing fishing boats add to the Grecian flavour, while broadsides of the crumbling Turkic Paphos Fortress, the stony archways of Saranta Kolones (a medieval Byzantine castle that crowns the dock), a famous 2nd century Odeon and the glistening sands of the municipal Alykes Beach are also all major draws. Definitely not one to be missed! "
Pissouri Bay,"Nestled neatly between two half-baked, scrub-clad headlands midway between the much-trodden towns of Limassol and Paphos, Pissouri oozes laid-back Mediterranean vibes and authentic Cypriot character from its small clutch of tavernas and rustic whitewashed homes. Still largely untouched by the onset of mass tourism, the terracotta-topped village is host to local farmers and wine makers, and boasts one sun-splashed central plaza (Pissouri Square) and regular celebrations of island heritage. And there’s a beach too – a half-pebble, half-sand stretch that arches its way below the rugged cliffs of the south coast just a short jaunt from the town proper. "
Akamas Peninsula National Park,"Rugged and windswept Akamas Peninsula National Park pokes its way out into the swells of the Med to form the north-western horn of Cyprus Island. It’s hailed by many to be one of the last remaining true wildernesses here; home to oodles of endemic species of flora and fauna. Today, ecotourism is booming, and travelers can discover wonders like the chiselled ridges of the Avakas Gorge, winding hiking trails that weave past blooming fields of crocuses and gladioli, thick fir forests, the mythical Baths of Aphrodite and truly secluded beaches to boot. There’s also a loggerhead and green turtle sanctuary that draws a crowd on Lara Bay; showcasing one of the more endangered marine species in the Med. "
Larnaka,"It’s likely that travelers landing in Cyprus will touch down first in Larnaca International Airport, while those who opt to make a beeline for the city itself (the third-largest in the country) are in for a medley of ancient sites and medieval relics, bustling, built-up seaside promenades and pretty churches. Start with tour of the hallowed Church of Saint Lazarus – the home of the tomb of its eponymous New Testament figure – before exploring the minarets and mosque domes of the Hala Sultan Tekke. And once the culture’s checked, Lanarca’s sun-kissed Phoinikoudes Beach beckons with its sea of colourful sun umbrellas and lines of fasolaki (black bean and lamb stew) touting tavernas. Nice. "
Kyrenia,"Forged by the Peloponnesian Greeks (fresh from the Trojan wars no less), Venetian settlers and Ottoman imperial rulers alike, Kyrenia – Girne in Turkish &#8211; remains one of the most enchanting and ancient towns on the entire north coast. The city can be found hugging a shimmering blue harbour on the edge of the rugged Kyrenia mountain range, and tourists now flit between the aromatic kebap and mezze joints here, people watching and enjoying the sight of salt-washed kaiki (traditional fishing boats) bobbing out at sea. Don’t miss the formidable rises of the Kyrenia Castle that dominate the eastern end of the harbour – a sturdy bulwark of Byzantine stone that has made this town such a tactical possession over the centuries. "
Tombs of the Kings,"UNESCO-attested and officially a part of the Paphos Archaeological Park, the mighty Tombs of the Kings are certainly worth a mention in their own right. They date back as far as the 4th century BC and offer an insight into the great mixing of architectural traditions and cultural heritage that took place on Cyprus in antiquity. Note the monolithic construction, and how the dusty colonnades of the various sepulchres emerge almost organically from the sandstone and windswept cliffs here on the edge of Kato Paphos. Curiously it’s Egyptian and Greek styles that dominate, with excavations revealing Doric colonnades and subterranean crevices where the bodies of Hellenistic and Roman noblemen were stowed. "
"Wooden Pier, Limassol, Cyprus","Touting an enchanting Old Town area of rustic low-rise bungalows, a terrific Byzantine castle, a vivacious seaside esplanade that weaves between the shore and the pretty palm-dotted gardens of the Akti Olympion Park, and one of the busiest ports in the entire eastern Mediterranean, Limassol strikes a fine balance between laid-back holidaying, culture-packed sightseeing and modern, Cypriot energy. And while Lady’s and Governor&#8217;s Beach dominate the line-up in the day and the fish eateries pull with fresh swordfish in the evening, it’s the clubs and pubs that take centre stage in Limassol after dark, pumping with chart hits, Europop and house between the buzzing strips of Potamos Yermasoyia. "
Nicosia,"The city that was hewn in two by the tumultuous political upheavals of the last century, Nicosia is slowly but surely regaining its balance. Today, visitors here experience one of the richest and most refined destinations in the country, where a romantic old town of Venetian-style palazzos and sun-splashed squares gives way to a labyrinth of winding alleys where chic bars meet fine-dining joints and al fresco coffee terraces. Meanwhile, North Nicosia (the Turkish side of town) is spiked with the minarets of Selimiye Mosque and awash with bustling Ottoman bazars and Byzantine houses, connected to the Cypriot south by the recently-reopened Ledra Street – a sprightly strip of shops, bars and bistros that’s something of a symbol for the new Nicosia. "
Troodos Mountains,"Cascading down the pine-dotted hillsides of the rugged Troodos Mountains in the very heart of central Cyprus, Agros’ whitewashed homes and red-tiled roofs shimmer a brilliant white against the Mediterranean sun. Rustic and away from the crowds of the coast, this is where the island’s agrotourism and ecotourism really booms, with hikers and bikers eager to hit the trails around town and foodies in search of the earthy smoked pork fillets and lamb cuts that are famed in these hills. What’s more, roses are one of the region’s main exports, and Agros locals are renowned for their production of rosewater, which is sold in roadside stalls and boutiques throughout the streets. "
Landscape Polis,"Nestled on the panhandle where the rugged wilds of the Akamas Peninsula bend into the northern coast, Polis is a laid-back, sun-splashed seaside town that draws visitors (mainly domestic ones) with the promise of an authentic and unhurried holiday. It’s enfolded by sweeping ridges of eucalyptus trees and dusty coastal rocks, and offers an old town centre of low-rise buildings clad in stone, where small beer bars rub shoulders with the ubiquitous souvenir stalls. Other draws include the string of secluded beaches that run along the coast to the west, and the interesting array of Attic ceramics at the Polis Archaeological Museum. "
Troodos,"Tiny little Troodos and its rustic array of half-timbered, dry-stone houses sits high up in the middle of the rugged northern reaches of Cyprus Island. It’s famed as the namesake of the great Troodos mountain range that dominates this section of the land, rising to a top with the snow-mantled (at least by winter) summits of Mount Olympos, where – believe it or not – two ski fields operate during the colder months of the year! A haven for hikers and outdoorsy types, this beautiful swathe of undulating peaks comes dressed in calabrian pines and golden oaks, soaring cypress trees and colourful orchid beds, peppered with UNESCO-attested Byzantine churches and crisscrossed by oodles of marked trails. "
Famagusta,"Famagusta is a culturally-rich town on the eastern end of Cyprus; a city of more than 40,000 people that boasts a buzzing port and a history that goes back all the way to the time when the rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt held sway in this section of the Med. The spot’s real gem, however, is its medieval heart, now hailed as one of the most enchanting walled cities in southern Europe. This is where travelers will find the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque and its curious Gothic edifices that belie its erstwhile moniker: the Cathedral of St. Nicholas. There are oodles of other renaissance gems to see in the area too, along with the old bullet holes and cannon craters of a 15th century Ottoman siege. "
Ayia Napa,"Just the name Ayia Napa is now synonymous with the Mediterranean’s hedonistic side, and boy does this sun-kissed stretch of pearly white sands and turquoise shore waters live up to its rep as a partying capital. Yes sir, while daytime means soothing hangovers on the sands of Nissi Beach and Grecian Bay, night time here ushers in an endless cacophony of hard house, grime, garage and Europop. The action centres on The Square; a small cobbled kernel of neon-lit bars and determined promoters that throbs with class-act DJs, rowdy pub crawls, multi-coloured shots and one serious lack of inhibitions. You’ve been warned! "
Protaras,"Something like the sober side of Ayia Napa, Protaras is a package holidayer’s dream. The town shimmers and shines against the deep blue hues of the Mediterranean Sea; its beaches – crowned by the much-lauded Fig Tree Bay &#8211; slope softly down to the lapping shores, peppered with sun loungers, volleyball courts and the occasional concession stand. Meanwhile, luxurious hotels and their crystalline swimming pools line the boardwalk along the coast, bicycles click past and international eateries offer mezze next to pizza and fries. Then there’s the pull of the waters here, with dive outfits operating out the town extolling the fantastic visibility and kaleidoscope of parrot fish, shipwrecks and corals below the surface. "
Karpaz Peninsula,"The elongated finger of land that stretches out from the north-eastern edge of Cyprus is something of an untrodden gem. It’s only visited by a few tourists each year and as such comes totally undeveloped, wild and rugged. Travelers who do come can expect to find a glorious montage of craggy rocks and salt-sprayed cliffs, secluded coves decorated with blooms of sand lily, and curious wild donkeys roaming between the heaths. Other must-sees in the region include the 10th-century Byzantine castle of Kantara, which sits at the very base of the peninsula, and the Apostolos Andreas Monastery – a pilgrimage destination for many a local. "
Clayton,"From 1850 to 1950, Clayton was primarily a railroad town that was once known for transporting peaches and part of Delaware’s first railroad. Visitors can get a taste of this history by visiting the Red Brick Monument at Clayton Station. Culturally, Clayton has a lot going on despite its small size.

The Victorian style buildings were once built by ship carpenters back during the time when the town was a major shipbuilding community. Today, you can get a nice window into its interesting history by visiting the Community House, walk through Bethel Memorial Park, and visit the homes of famous ship captains. And while the architecture is mostly of Victorian style, most buildings actually date back much earlier. "

New Castle,"When it comes to historic small towns, New Castle is one of the best preserved in the entire country. Cobblestone streets with colonial style architecture wind around the Delaware River.

The town itself is situated on peaceful waters where you can go boating and fishing. "
"Governor Ross Mansion, Seaford, DE","Seaford is a coastal small town with tons of parks, historic sites, and interesting things to see. Most notably, the Ross Mansion and Plantation was once owned by the former governor, William Ross. On a tour of the plantation, you can learn more about the dark history that took place during the Civil War Era. The Seaford Museum also exhibits Native American artifacts, documents from the Revolutionary War, and other interesting items of the past. During Christmastime, Seaford hosts the largest parade on the Delmarva Peninsula that goes over-the-top when it comes to entertainment and festive cheer. The Nanticoke Riverfest is a must-attend summertime activity that involves floating down the Nanticoke River on innertubes or standup paddle boards.

Wyoming,"Picture a mirror-calm pond surrounded by manicured lawns, playgrounds, game areas, and picnic amenities. This can all be found at Wyoming Park. The little town of Wyoming (self-proclaimed as the best) is focused on building a strong sense of community and comfort. Interestingly, it’s most famous for its peaches. Every summer, the town puts on the Peach Festival that serves all types of peach pies, peach flavored ice cream, and tours of Fifer Orchards – the largest peach orchard in the state. "
Rehoboth Beach,"Colorful, lively, and never boring, Rehoboth Beach is the best place to visit for adventurous travelers who love to spend all their time seaside. Stroll along the restaurant-lined boardwalk, dip your toes in the sea, and keep an ear out for local musicians performing free concerts. The town is known to attract eclectic and artistic personalities, who love to share their work in boutique art shops and galleries. The restaurants in Rehoboth Beach are above standard and usually have a fun atmosphere, so come hungry and save room for dessert. "
Arden,"Arden is perhaps one of the most intriguing small towns in Delaware – if not the entire country. It was established by two utopian architects who wanted to create a single-tax community that solely focuses on equality and togetherness. Homes designed by the founder, Will Price, are all on the National Register of Historic Places. Citizens believe in simplified spellings, support live theatre (especially performed by the Shakespeare “Gild”), and welcome visitors of all types. If you visit Arden, you’ll want to stay more than just a few days to gain the full experience. Here, the people make the place rather than the area’s attractions. "
Copenhagen,"Cool, calm and sophisticated, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-copenhagen-denmark/"">Copenhagen</a> is every inch a 21st-century Scandinavian capital. It can be found facing Malmo across the Oresund Strait, rising against the rollers of the Baltic Sea in a patchwork of red-tiled medieval roofs and uber-modern new builds. It is home to more than one million Danes and hosts neighbourhoods like Vesterbro and Christianshavn, where chic cafes abut restaurants like Noma (oft hailed as the single greatest fine-dining joint in the world!). Right at the heart of the capital stands the enchanting Indre By; a web of narrow streets and alleyways where the formidable Rundetarn tower and the ancient fortifications of Slotsholmen stand tall, and the Tivoli Gardens throb with energy and life. In short: there’s never a dull moment in this truly bucket-list metropolis! "
Gásadalur,"Rising like hulking, petrified rocks where the Norwegian Sea fuses with the North, the Faroe Islands are the stuff of legends. Their coastlines are dramatic in the extreme; chiselled and sheer-cut, carved by crashing waterfalls and topped with a layer of verdant green grass. The Northern Lights shimmer in the sky, while the timber towns and hamlets below hide rowdy fisherman’s taverns and pubs that tick over to the trademark local folk shanties. While only half-in and half-out of Denmark (the Faroe’s are self-governing), these otherworldly and far-flung islands rarely fail to draw a gasp! "
Helsingor,"Running the length of the island of Zealand’s northern coast, the so-called Danish Riviera is home to some of the finest beach resorts in all of Scandinavia. Particularly popular are the castle towns of Helsingor and Hillerod, which play host to the majestic Kronborg Castle (the stomping ground of Shakespeare’s Prince Hamlet no less) and the elegant Renaissance Frederiksborg Palace respectively. Beach wise, Gilleleje and Hornbaek take the biscuit with their yellow stretches of sun-splashed sand, backed by undulating dunes and colourful beds of roses. And then there are the coastal forests, headed by the primeval beech groves of Gribskov (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the much younger Scots pines of Tisvilde. "
Odense,"The urban jewel in the touristic line-up of Funen Island, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-odense-denmark/"">Odense</a> is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen. However, there’s much more to this quaint and charming town than its honorific exhibitions and monuments to arguably the greatest fairy tale teller of all time (and there are plenty of these!). Yes sir, there are the gorgeous turrets and moats of Egeskov Castle, the looming Knuds Kirke and the sepulchre of King Canute himself, street upon street of elegant low-rise Scandinavian homes, cobbled squares in the old quarter and creaking timber windmills on the edge of town. What’s more, a lively university scene and countless cafes add a dash of energy and nightlife to the mix, while Odense Zoo remains the best in the country. "
Skagen,"Resplendent Skagen, its rows of terracotta-roofed houses and painted timber buildings, glows against the deep blue-grey of the North Sea. A magnet for painters and poets over the years, Denmark’s northernmost town is famed for its fresh air and postcard location between the Jutland beaches and the dunes. One aged lighthouse stands as testimony to the town’s long held connection to the sea, while oodles of glass, pottery and craft boutiques along the beachfront rows and Sankt Laurentii Vej street have cemented Skagen as a town for artsy types and freethinkers. "
Roskilde,"Thanks to its namesake rock and pop festival that booms on the fields to the south of Roskilde each year in June and July, this Zealand city has become almost synonymous with hedonism. However, even if you don’t head in to pitch the tent and party, Roskilde has plenty on the menu. For one, the town boasts an uber-long history that has its roots in the pagan age of the Vikings, while the old quarter at the heart of the city comes adorned with one seriously gorgeous UNESCO cathedral, the ochre facades of the Roskilde Palace, the acclaimed Viking Ship Museum on the edge of the Roskilde Fjord, a clutch of haunting stone churches from the Middle Ages and a welcoming population of students that ebbs and flows with the local university’s terms. "
Skjoldungernes Land National Park,"A relatively recent addition to Denmark’s line-up of national parks, the Skjoldungernes Land is a fascinating and beautiful area that encompasses sections of Frederikssund, Roskilde and Lejre in the very heart of Zealand. It’s famed for its eerie Viking burial mounds, which bubble up unexpectedly from the rolling meadows and grassy hills here as a testimony to the onetime dominion of the Iron Age King Skjold. The most famous of these ancient sepulchres can be found around the town of Lejre, which sits enfolded in enchanting swaths of beech forest and decorated with the pretty Baroque faces and manicured gardens of the Ledreborg Palace to boot. "
Aarhus,"Denmark’s second city makes its home on the edge of the Kattegat Sea, and sits enfolded by the wild forests of Djursland. A town that’s always on the up, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-aarhus-denmark/"">Aarhus</a> throbs with culture and heritage. Museums like the ARoS and the Den Gamle By (one of the largest open air exhibitions in the country) draw in big crowds, while the old centre of half-timbered homes and Germanic municipal buildings is perfect for strolling and indulging in café culture. Meanwhile, interesting boutiques showcase the town’s indelible creativity on Stroget shopping street, and the emporiums and tea houses of the Latin Quarter are almost irresistible. And that’s not even mentioning the electric nightlife, led by the massive student population during term times! "
Thy National Park,"Spread out over more than 240 square kilometers on the windward tip of Jutland, the untrodden Thy National Park is a place which still holds true to Scandinavia’s reputation for wild landscapes and untouched natural beauty. Between its borders, the reserve encompasses undulating dashes of heath and bog, coastal dunes dressed is tawny sea grasses, sporadic pockets of conifer forest and the occasional bucolic hamlet set to the sound of the northern rollers. Hiking and biking are two of the top activities here, and travelers eager to delve into the park can now make use of countless kilometers of maintained trails. "
Fredericia,"Nestled in the coastal join between the Jutland Peninsula and the pretty island of Funen, Fredericia began life as a purpose-built fortified town to protect Danish lands in the aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War. Today and this conflict-ridden past still oozes out of every gate and bulwark that make up the encircling city walls, while monuments like The Foot Soldier stand as testimony to Fredericia’s continued strategic importance right up until the start of the modern age. And if you’re not into your military history, there’s also one seriously gorgeous stretch of sand to be found at the city’s Eastern Beach, along with pretty Palsgaard Lake, a clutch of earthy Jutland taverns and oodles, oodles more. "
Legoland,"Set right in the heart of the Jutland Peninsula, tiny little <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-billund-denmark/"">Billund</a> is really known for one thing and one thing only: Lego. Started here in the early 1900s by the Danish entrepreneur Ole Kirk Christiansen, the global brand still informs the local way of life. On the edge of town is where travelers will discover the Lego factory, while the piece de resistance is surely the famed Legoland Billund theme park, where the likes of the adrenaline-pumping Dragon coaster, the Polar X-plorer, Duplo Land and Danish-inspired Vikings River Splash all draw up to a whopping two million visitors a year! "
Bornholm Coast,"Stranded on its own betwixt the icy rollers of the Baltic Sea, the island of Bornholm is a laid-back place where travelers can seek out salt-washed fishing villages, rugged seascapes complete with chiselled granite cliffs, Scandinavian timber towns, deep forests and anthropomorphic monoliths protruding from the ocean. In the north, the gorgeous Hammeren Peninsula is a favourite amongst walkers, boasting windswept cliffs and undulating farm fields, stone churches and beautiful lighthouses to boot. Wide Dueodde beach also draws a crowd, while the gorges and forests of Almindingen are watched over by European honey buzzards and white-tailed eagles. In short, this one’s perhaps Denmark’s prettiest natural enclave! "
Ribe,"Picture-perfect Ribe hails in as Denmark’s oldest town. Its roots go all the way back to the 9th century, and its sloping cobbled streets and narrow alleyways, ice-cream coloured cottages and wobbly web of red-brick buildings stand as testimony to a past that’s wrapped up in tales of the Vikings and a medieval merchant boom. At the town’s heart rises the majestic spires and towers of the Ribe Cathedral; a veritable palimpsest of architectural styles that’s said to be one of the most elegant Romanesque constructions in the country. And once the history and heritage is done and dusted, Ribe’s array of excellent restaurants and bespoke beer and sweet shops await. Nice. "
Aalborg,"Sprawled out over the banks of the pretty Limfjord Sound, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-aalborg-denmark/"">Aalborg</a> is a post-industrial centre with a difference. Its urban heart is decorated with a series of famous half-timbered mansions, while students flock to the city universities during term time and bring a lively, youthful vibe in tow, adding a ceaseless chatter to the waterfront promenade and sleepless energy to the meanders of Jomfru Ane Gade (the longest party street in all of Scandinavia if you believe the locals). Aalborg is also known for its curious yearly carnival; one of the largest in northern Europe, when the folk of Jutland flood the streets with fancy dress, music and beer-fuelled festivities. "
Kerteminde,"Perfect for travelers eager to glimpse the timeless, sleepy side of uber-pretty Funen Island, Kerteminde offers a quaint array of timbered homes and winding cobblestone streets. The centre of the town has changed little since the late Middle Ages, despite the appearance of a few enticing coffee joints and restaurants, while fantastic exhibitions like the Ladby Viking ship and the home of famous national painter Johannes Larsen add just a dash of ancient history and culture into the mix. Others will head to Kerteminde on route to the windswept reaches of Romso Island out at sea, where some of Denmark’s most remote natural landscapes await in all their rugged glory! "
Derby: Cathedral Church of All Saints,"There are so many sides to Derby that it will be tricky to know where to start. Certainly the Derby Museum and Art Gallery has to be one of your points of entry. That&#8217;s because of its many works by Joseph Wright of Derby, the 18th-century master of chiaroscuro and an agent of the Enlightenment for his enthusiasm for laboratories and science experiments. If you&#8217;re serious about real ale then Derby is right up your street, and those in the know says there&#8217;s a bigger choice of ales at pubs in the city than anywhere else in the country. Journey back to Georgian times in Derby at the Pickford House Museum and sample the culture in the historic cathedral quarter, and you&#8217;ll still be just getting started. "
Buxton Opera house,"Founded by the Romans, the spa town of Buxton has been a tourist attraction for hundreds of years. But it became highly fashionable in the 1780s when the Fifth Duke of Devonshire ordered made his mark with some glorious projects. One of the showpieces was the magnificent Crescent, designed by the Vaunted Georgian architect James Carr. This sits right beside St Ann&#8217;s Well, where Buxton&#8217;s celebrated spring water emerges from the ground at 27.5°C. Elsewhere the Pavilion Gardens are as refined as it gets, and the Opera House from 1903 is an art nouveau wonder. You can also see Buxton&#8217;s unusual geology for yourself at Poole&#8217;s Cavern, a limestone show-cave dating back two million years and with more than 300 metres open to the public. "
"Chesterfield, England","The large market town of Chesterfield wouldn&#8217;t be the same without its strange-looking spire. Crowning the largest church in Derbyshire, the spire of St Mary and All Saints&#8217; is both twisted and slanting. It was added to the church in the 14th century and all sorts of weird explanations have been ventured for its singular appearance. But the most likely is the lead in the south side of the roof has expanded and contracted over the course of hundreds of years of sunny days. Resting on a hilltop with privileged views of the countryside is Hardwick Hall, which was built for Bess of Hardwick, the richest woman in Elizabethan England after the Queen. Her house is one of the most prestigious and beautiful stately homes in the country, and was among the first renaissance buildings designed in England. "
Peak District,"Derbyshire has more of this national park in its boundaries than any other county. And you&#8217;ll understand how the Peak District changes, from the grassy limestone valleys in the south to the barren and unpopulated sandstone moors in the north, all within this county. There are several weeks-worth of heartrending natural sights, from epic escarpments with sheer cliffs to caves rich in minerals that occur only in this place. Writers like Jane Austen, Wordsworth and Charlotte Brontë were all inspired by this natural splendour, and it&#8217;s also fascinating to see how humans have shaped the land with mining and industrial activities that have long been consigned to the past. "
Bakewell,"The only market town to be set within the National Park&#8217;s boundaries, Bakewell is gorgeous as you&#8217;d hope, full of stone buildings and grand courtyards. One of the oldest monuments in the town is the bridge over the Wye, with five gothic pointed arches and constructed around the time Bakewell got its market charter in 1254.The surrounding limestone dales are predictably spectacular, and the choice of footpaths is vast, but the Monsal Trail is probably the pick for families. This is on a disused railway line, so the gradients suit hikers of all ages. And whatever you do, you need to make time for two of Britain&#8217;s most acclaimed stately homes, Chatsworth House and Haddon Hall, both local to Bakewell. "
Wirksworth,"The lead-mining industry had started in Wirksworth around Roman times, and even in the 18th-century the writer Daniel Defoe reported that there were thousands of mines in the area. The industry had died away by the 1900s but the Church of St Mary&#8217;s has a phenomenal artefact that makes clear just how old the practice had been. There&#8217;s an Anglo-Saxon stone from the 600s, called &#8220;Th&#8217; owd Man&#8221; with a carving depicting a lead miner. This is coupled with a coffin lid, also dated to the 600s and depicting angels. The town of Wirksworth has loads of character and its Georgian inns, tea rooms, pubs and galleries make it an ideal HQ for a holiday in the Peak District. "
Ashbourne,"This town is the closest to one of the Peak District&#8217;s pieces of paradise: Dovedale is a steep wooded valley that promises an unforgettable walk and photos that will almost defy belief. And no visit is complete without hopping over the stepping stones across the water. In summer the reservoir Carsington Water is a honey pot for sailors, anglers, birdwatchers and cyclists, all in another wonderful setting. There&#8217;s history at Sudbury Hall, which has the National Trust Museum of Childhood, putting you in the short trousers or dress of a Victorian schoolchild. And with so much in the area, Ashbourne more than enough pubs and inns to accommodate its many visitors. This is also a legacy from when the town was a staging post, and an important stop on the road from London to Carlisle. "
"Matlock, Derbyshire","Next to the River Derwent, which has fashioned some awe-inspiring landscapes to the south, Matlock developed as a spa town after its springs were discovered in 1698. When hydrotherapy was all the rage in the 1800s visitors came from far and wide for treatments, and this has left Matlock with beautiful architecture to match its exquisite natural location. The riverside has a string of paths allowing you to saunter down to the old resort of Matlock Bath to the south. Head here the Heights of Abraham, with a cable car traversing the river gorge and two caves created by almost 2,000 years of lead-mining. "
"Belper, England","You can trace the first sparks of the Industrial Revolution to Belper, which belongs to the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. In this town the industrialist and innovator Jedediah Strutt harnessed the Derwent&#8217;s water power to built some of the earliest textile mills in Belper in the 1770s. So at sites like Strutt&#8217;s North Mill you&#8217;ll go back to the earliest instances of what we recognise as modern factories. After its predecessor had been destroyed by fire this building from 1803 was the first in the world to feature a fireproof iron frame. Also give the high street in Belper a look, as it was crowned the best in Britain in 2014. "
Glossop,"At the very north of the county, Glossop is an old cotton milling town at the northern foothills of the Peak District. This portion of the park is known as the Dark Peak, as beneath the soil is a layer of darker sandstone. The landscape is wilder and less habitable, with eerie moorland and peat bogs in the valleys. Glossop&#8217;s gorgeous old cottages are built from this sandstone, and although it has a history that starts with the Romans, the town expanded in the early-1800s with the mills. Now it&#8217;s a well-off commuter town, where people from Manchester move for rural airs, and because of the ease with which you can get into the national park. "
"Castleton, Derbyshire","At the transition between the Dark Peak and the greener White Peak to the south, the delightful village of Castleton is very popular with tourists. And it&#8217;s not hard to see why: First go below ground, into the Blue John and Treak Cliff Caverns, the only mines in the world that have Blue John, a kind of fluorite fashioned into bowls and decorative items starting in the 18th century. The visitor centre in Castleton has a few objects made from this lustrous material. And in the light of day all you need is your own two feet to conquer majestic locations like the brooding Mam Tor, where an Iron Age fort one stood, or the picturesque ruins of Peveril Castle, built by the Normans in 1086. "
Sharpe&#8217;s Pottery Museum,"In the 18th and 19th centuries, South Derbyshire, just like neighbouring Staffordshire, was all about the pottery industry. Anything from bricks and toilets, to expansive ceramics for industrialists were crafted in this town. Sharpe&#8217;s Pottery Museum can put you in touch with this aspect of Swadlincote&#8217;s story at a beautifully-restored bottle kiln, complete with workshops and outbuildings. Now the town is in the newly conceived National Forest, a recent project to replant the colossal tracts of woodland that covered most of the midlands up to the industrial age. So far eight million ash, pine and oak trees have been planted. "
Edale,"Grizzled adventurers intending to walk the entirety of the Pennine Way will begin their trek at Edale, which is the southern trailhead. This National Trail courses through 267 miles of England&#8217;s most challenging wilderness, and if you&#8217;re planning on doing it one go you&#8217;ll need to allow three weeks. If you&#8217;re only in Edale for the weekend you could go by the Moorland Centre, explaining the human and natural history of the local moors, before striking out on one of the circular paths. A demanding local option is Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, an old zigzagging packhorse road that connected Sheffield with Manchester and Liverpool. Work up an appetite on the moors before retiring  to one of Edale&#8217;s Pubs for a warming meal and pint of real ale. "
Stanage Edge,"This endearing village in the Peak District is used as a base for walks in the spectacular Hope Valley. Moments away is Stanage Edge, an awesome sandstone escarpment with 100-metre walls for some of the best climbing in the national park. Hathersage is also steeped in folklore and has associations with the author Charlotte Brontë. At St Michael&#8217;s Church is what is claimed to be the grave of Robin Hood&#8217;s lieutenant Little John. And in the 1800s Brontë stayed in the village while she was writing Jane Eyre, and locations like the gorgeous North Lees Hall (Thornfield Hall in Jane Eyre) have fictional counterparts in the book. "
Bolsover Castle,"In the northeast of Derbyshire, Bolsover is a former coalmining town that suffered a little after the main source of employment left in the 80s and 90s. Bolsover has a very different feel to say Matlock or Chesterfield, which are both only a few miles away. But the countryside is lovely, the people are warm, and one of the county&#8217;s most striking historical buildings is here. Boldover Castle started life as a Norman fortress, but in the 1600s was turned into th distinguished palace that remains today. Less than ten minutes east of Bolsover are the Cresswell Crags, the site of Europe&#8217;s northernmost prehistoric cave paintings. "
Dartmoor,"The largest and least-inhabited open space in southern England, Dartmoor is as mysterious as it is visually breathtaking. This wilderness is suffused with stories of headless horsemen, ghostly beasts and pixies, and has been inspiring artists and writers for centuries, most notably Arthur Conan Doyle when he wrote the Hound of the Baskervilles. Giving the landscapes their incomparable ambience is the granite, which bursts through the surface at the summit of Dartmoor&#8217;s tors (hills), the highest points in Southern England. Granite has been sculpted into a multitude of monuments around Dartmoor going back to the Neolithic and Bronze Age, all standing the test of time for the durability of this stone. "
Exeter,"The name of this wonderful university city gives clues to its ancient origins, and Exeter was in fact the most southwesterly Roman fortification on  the British Isles. Lose no time  in getting to the gothic cathedral, rightly considered one of England&#8217;s most beautiful. Just stand in the nave and be astounded by the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling of any building in the country. See the 14th-century Guildhall, which is the oldest civic building still performing its civic function, and suss out Exeter&#8217;s rich trading history at the historic quayside. There&#8217;s much, much more besides, like the medieval subterranean tunnels and the fantastic Royal Albert Memorial Museum. "
Plymouth,"Few places could claim to have a maritime tradition as rich as Plymouth&#8217;s, which will forever recall names like Sir Francis Drake and the Mayflower, which set sail for America from this port. Survey the seascape of Plymouth Sound from Plymouth Hoe as Sir Francis Drake is claimed to have done over a game of bowls, before boarding his warship Revenge to meet the Spanish Armada at the Battle of Gravelines in 1588. The Barbican is the most historic area in Plymouth, a waterside district of tight cobblestone streets, old inns and now artists&#8217; studios and galleries. "
Torquay,"Devon&#8217;s mild climate makes it a more reliable beach getaway than almost anywhere in England, and at the forefront has to be Torquay. There are nine sandy beaches on the seafront of this endearing coastal town, three of which have the Blue Flag for the quality of the water and services for visitors. And these glorious beaches go hand-in-hand with some seriously good family days out. At Kents Cavern there&#8217;s 700,000 years of human history, so there&#8217;s a thrilling anthropological dimension to the tour of this outstanding natural formation. Add to that, Babbacombe, a cliff-top district with a remarkable miniature village, the Living Coasts Zoo and the elegant Cockington Country House and park. "
Dartmouth Castle,"You&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find a prettier coastal town in England than Dartmouth. On the western bank of the Dart Estuary, the harbour has been a seafaring hub for many centuries. Knights departed from the Crusades from Dartmouth and privateers were based in the town as early as medieval times. Many alleys and lanes like Smith Street and Duke Street look much like they would have done in Tudor times and are crowded with old inns and merchants&#8217; houses. See the Grade I-listed Butterwalk, a delightful row of corbelled houses supported by stone columns. And fans of whodunits can pay a visit to Greenway, holiday escape of Agatha Christie. "
Exmoor,"Overlapping with the neighbouring county of Somerset, Exmoor is the second of Devon&#8217;s two national parks, pushing up against the north coast of the county. It&#8217;s a world of untamed sandstone moors, accessible via more than 1,000 kilometres of footpaths and bridleways, crossing rivers and snaking along green valleys and up summits like the 520-metre-high Dunkery Hill. From the middle ages up to the 20th-century the local economy was sustained by the wool trade. Left behind are interesting and beautiful vestiges of this industry, like water mills and yarn markets. Exmoor Ponies run free in the park, and aren&#8217;t so much a breed as a species of pony, closely related to wild horses. "
"Combesgate Beach, Woolacombe, Devon","On the North Devon Coast, the beach at Woolacombe, often listed as one of the greatest in Europe, is vast, sandy, cradled in greenery and with waves that are more than surfable. So this packs in a mix of families and sun-seekers, but there&#8217;s more than enough space for both along these three miles. For the best waves, surfers need only go a couple of miles down the coast to Coryde. The beach there has what could be described as the best beachbreak in the country in the right conditions; a perfectly formed A-frame barrel best ridden in winter because of the on-shore winds and healthy Atlantic swell. "
Totnes,"On the River Dart in the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Totnes is a town a little out of the ordinary. This is an upshot of its alternative community, fostering artists and musicians and giving rise to a twice weekly market with organic and fair-trade items. For a casual visitor one of the many great things about Totnes&#8217; independent spirit is the amount of locally-owned shops and eateries, a real breath of fresh air compared to a typical English high street. For history and culture, explore the ruins of Totnes Castle, be transported to the 14th-century at the majestic Dartington Hall and track the history of the famous Pomeroy and Seymour families at the Tudor Berry Pomeroy Castle. "
"Sidmouth, Devon","Unlike many of the places covered so far, Sidmouth was just a small fishing village until wealthy Georgians and Victorians came to make the most of the sea air and waters at its shingle beach. This sudden growth over the space of few decades gave the town many streets of stuccoed and painted hotels and houses, as well as a regal esplanade behind the beach. Landward, Sidmouth is bounded on all sides by the East Devon Area of Natural Beauty and on the coast are the classic red cliffs of the Triassic period. For real local culture come in the first week of August for the Sidmouth Folk Festival, with 700 events put on at venues around the town. "
Jurassic Coast,"Both east and west of Sidmouth is Devon&#8217;s stretch of the Jurassic Coast, which is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here 185 million years of geological history have been revealed by coastal erosion. In different stages of its distant prehistory this part of the world has been many different types of environments, including marsh, sea and even desert, and emerging from the cliff faces and rocks are the fossils of the massive variety of animals and plants that lived here. So needless to say, if you&#8217;re a fossil hunter the East Devon coast will be a dreamland, following in the footsteps of Mary Anning, whose amazing fossil discoveries in the 1800s changed the world&#8217;s understanding prehistoric life. "
Paignton,"Right in the heart of Torbay, the length of coastline unofficially known as the English Riviera, Paignton is a seaside escape for both families and couples. If you require lots of entertainment for little ones then Paignton Beach is the way to go, with a long pleasure pier and the imaginative Geoplay Park on the foreshore. Paignton Zoo Environmental Park is an animal attraction with a conscience and up there with England&#8217;s top zoos. And if you need a wide open, seemingly boundless beach Goodrington Sands next-door or the divine Broadsands will do the trick. Adding some Victorian atmosphere to the setting is the Dartmouth steam railway, with grand locomotives passing above these beaches in the summer. "
Exmouth,"The seaside resort of Exmouth has a location full of drama on the east bank of the River Exe where it enters the sea. On the town&#8217;s esplanade the vistas over the estuary are incredible, and at Exmouth Landing you can set sail on a ferry for a short voyage across to the village of Starcross on the west bank. The sandy Exmouth is a joy, and the Southwest Coast Path, which encompasses all of Devon and Cornwall&#8217;s coastline will lead you to the rugged Orcombe Point in a couple of minutes, and then the high bluffs and natural beaches of the Devon Cliffs a little way beyond that. An eccentric stately home close by is A La Ronde, a 16-sided house from the 1700s open to the public, thanks to the National Trust. "
Tavistock,"An alternative to Devon&#8217;s seaside resorts, Tavistock is a rural market town on the edge of Dartmoor to the west of the county. For several hundred years Tavistock was known for its stannaries, tin mines that were exclusive to Cornwall and Devon. Just across the border these chimerical old sites are listed by UNESCO.  And throughout this time, all the way from the 1300s to the present day, the Pannier Market has been in business. Unlike many of the country&#8217;s markets this one is as bustling as ever, and has stalls selling anything from furniture and handicrafts to regional treats like fudge and jams. And after that you can do a circuit of Tavistock&#8217;s low-key but endearing landmarks, such as the ruins of Tavistock Abbey and Bedford Square where you&#8217;re greeted by the lovely gothic town hall. "
Ilfracombe,"Nestled in hilly scenery that plunges to the water down sharp cliff-sides, Ilfracombe is a charming rural town that also has all the fun of the seaside. On the South West Coast Path you&#8217;ll be treated to some of the region&#8217;s prettiest views as you approach Ilfracombe from  Hillsborough Hill to the east and see the greenery and the headlands protecting the town. Right above the harbour is Lantern Hill, topped with a 14th-century chapel that has carried a beacon to guide boats into port since the 1600s. And from the harbour you could catch a boat to Lundy Island, which has large numbers of seals and puffins. "
Seaton,"The sleepy seaside town of Seaton could be a good choice if you&#8217;re in need of a convenient location on the Jurassic Coast. There&#8217;s a new visitor centre that gives you some extra insights about the coastline, and would go well with an afternoon hunting for fossils. The Seaton Tramway is a heritage line that runs inland next to the Axe River Estuary to the charming towns of Colyton and Colyford. Just west of Seaton is the village of Beer, with soaring limestone cliffs that were quarried extensively from medieval times for stone that was used in many churches and cathedrals like London&#8217;s Westminster Abbey and St Pauls. The quarry&#8217;s tunnels are now a fascinating tourist attraction. "
Djibouti City,"Djibouti City serves a number of purposes.  First, it’s a great staging area for excursions into the hinterland or out on the sea.  Second, it serves as a small dose of comfort when you’re coming back from those excursions.  There are good restaurants, bars, and hotels here, so there are creature comforts that you can look forward to. Third, it’s really charming and easy to love.  You’ll notice a definite sense of change about town as the people work to transform their city from the rundown outpost it once was in the 80’s and 90’s. It’s a bit of a melting pot here with lots of cultural contradictions that fun to observe. "
Lake Assal,"“Honey Lake” is a crater lake at the western end of the Gulf of Tadjoura. It’s 155 metres below sea level, making it the second lowest land depression on Earth after the Dead Sea.  Lake Assal is the largest salt reserve and the locals consider it to be a national treasure.  It’s in the process of becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site and the views around the lake are unbelievable. "
Tadjoura,"It’s one of the oldest towns on the east coast of African and dates back at least to the 12th century. Governed by a sultan, Tadjoura was once a great port for goods between Djibouti and Ethiopia – including, unfortunately, slave trade.  Often called La Ville Blanche, or White Town, because of the many lovely whitewashed homes in town, it’s a great town for walking as there are many great views of the waterfront.  In the late afternoons you’ll find all the locals out and about.  There are a number of nice mosques to see and you’ll love relaxing and soaking up the atmosphere of this quieter and less chaotic version of Djibouti City. "
Ali Sabieh,"Near the border of Somalia and Ethiopia, Ali Sabieh is surrounded by awe-inspiring desert on all sides.  Inside the city you’ll find plenty of great markets, food stalls, and narrow alleys. This is rustic and rugged Africa at its best.  Surprisingly, there are spots of natural beauty nearby and very little tourist development to take away from it. To see the desert at its best, check out Grand Bara and Petit Bara. It’s also worth trying some wind surfing while there, or any of the many sport adventure activities.  The entire area is famous for its challenging walking trails. "
Beach on the Gulf of Tadjoura,"Wonderfully surrounded by the lush Goda Mountains which reach heights of up to 1300 metres, the Gulf of Tadjoua is considered by those that have been there to be the perfect spot for diving and snorkelling with whale sharks.  The two towns that tend to, rightfully, attract the most tourist attention are Obock and Tadjoura.  In the latter you’ll find beautiful sea vistas and seven nationally important mosques. "
Goba’ad Plain,"This area, located between Lake Abhe and the Hanle Plain is a great place for bird watchers.  Goba’ad is the only place in Djibouti with an active breeding ostrich population.  You’ll also spot Black Crown Sparrows, Arabian Bustard, Sand grouses, Crombec, and so many more.  This lowland area is covered with shallow wadis, large sand flats, and acacia scrub. It’s areas like this that make the country such a draw for nature lovers. "
Hanlé Plain,"Adjacent to the Goba’ad Plain, the ecosystem is similar.  The lowland valley is surrounded by steep mountains and populated by several small freshwater lakes.  It’s another great place for bird lovers with the chance to see Egyptian Goose, black crake, and the three banded plover. "
Khor Ambado,"These two amazing beaches are located about 15 km from Djibouti City.  Here you’ll find great swimming and black lava cliffs that border the beach.  There are great local sightseeing tours that leave from here and you can also take part in any number of water sports.  The sunsets from Khor Ambado are some of the best in the country.  If you’re looking to relax and unwind for a couple of days of sand and surf, you can’t go wrong here. "
Tropical Aquarium Djibouti,"This is one of the country’s top tourist draws.  Located in the historic part of town, it’s considered one of the best in all of Africa.  It’s designed so that you feel like you’re underwater in the Red Sea, getting a firsthand look at marine life in this unique body of water.  The ecosystems are perfectly restored and recreated here.  Pair your visit with a stop at Marche Central, the lively and chaotic central market, and you’ll spend a fun filled afternoon in the city. "
Day Forest National Park,"This giant oasis is filled with the vibrant colours of the Djibouti desert.  About 20 km from the Gulf of Tadjoura, nature enthusiasts will fall in love with Day Forest National Park.  Surround by desert, this is one of two protected forested areas in the country.  It’s the largest forest and the most important ecosystem is the 900 ha stand of East African Junipers which grow to almost 1000 metres. If you’re lucky you can spot the Toha or Djibouti sunbird – both of which have only ever been seen inside the forest. "
Weymouth,"It&#8217;s easy to see why the coastal town of Weymouth is such a hit with tourists: Straight away there&#8217;s the enchanting harbour, set on the banks of the River Wey before it reaches the sea. The quays have a quaint jumble of old inns and warehouses, and you can take in the scene from a waterside bench and watch the yachts and trawlers come and go. And then there&#8217;s the beach: Long, sandy and with waters safe for kids to spend whole sunny days paddling and splashing around. There&#8217;s always something big going on in Weymouth, be it the Kite Festival in May and the Seafood Festival on the quaysides in July. "
Bournemouth,"A spa town from the early-1800s onwards, Bournemouth attracted Regency and Victorian society&#8217;s upper crust for health retreats for its warm climate (comparatively!), gardens, pine woodland and fresh sea air. Large villas were built in this time and continue to lend the town a feeling of grandeur and opulence. There are seven miles of beaches on the coast, one of which is the Blue Flag Alum Chine, with perfect golden sands. Potter around the artisan shops in Westbourne and sample the nightlife around the Square area. A real trove of British art and decoration awaits at the Russell-Cotes Gallery, set in a sumptuous Art Nouveau villa on a cliff-top. "
Dorchester,"Dorset&#8217;s county town is both beautiful and historic, with tons of listed buildings in its centre and majestic estates like Athelhampton and Kingston Maurward in the immediate countryside. For shopping and nightlife, look no further than the newly regenerated Brewery Square, set in front of the striking old Eldridge Pope Brewery. The esteemed Victorian writer Thomas Hardy spent most of his life in and near Dorchester. You can visit Thomas Hardy&#8217;s Cottage, a quaint thatched house where he was born in 1840 and resided until 34, during which time he wrote classics like Far from the Madding Crowd. Also open is the more sophisticated Max Gate, a Victorian mansion that Hardy occupied from 1885 until he died in 1928. "
Jurassic Coast,"The entirety of Dorset&#8217;s western shoreline, from Studley all the way to the boundary with Devon, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rugged limestone throughout has recorded some 185 million years of natural history, and is layered with fossils of the plants and animals that have lived in this area during that time. The beaches have been prime fossil-hunting territory for hundreds of years, and were first made famous by the 19th-century amateur, Mary Anning, whose eye for a valuable fossil has never been equalled. The village of Charmouth is right by Golden Cap, the highest cliff on England&#8217;s south coast, and is also home to the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre where you can tap into the natural and human history of this singular coastline. "
"Poole, Dorset","On a vast natural harbour, Poole&#8217;s calm, sheltered seas are possibly the best on the south coast for watersports, and sailors, fishers, windsurfers all very well-catered for. If you&#8217;re up for some sightseeing, the twee traditional quay in Poole is a working maritime district and the point of embarkation for a host of cruises and excursions. One of the favourites is Brownsea Island, owned entirely by the National Trust and cloaked in pine and oak woodland, with exciting little fragments of history here and there. But Sandbanks is what really draws the crowds in Poole. Most people say it&#8217;s the best beach in Britain, a sandy spit that shields the north side of the harbour and has a kilometre of soft golden sand. "
Sherborne,"It&#8217;s not unusual to see Sherborne included in lists of the UK&#8217;s most beautiful towns. Sherborne is mostly built with the ochre-coloured &#8220;ham stone&#8221;, quarried from just across the boundary in Somerset and making everything just a little more gorgeous. For a small town there&#8217;s a great deal to see. The abbey is outstanding, particularly the fine fan vaulting in the nave and chance. This building started out as a Saxon cathedral in the early-8th century, and you can still see vestiges of this structure around the western portal . Add to this, two castles, the newest of which was ordered by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1594, and you&#8217;ll have enough for a breathless couple days of sightseeing. "
Lyme Regis,"If you fancy yourself as the next Mary Anning make a bee-line for Monmouth Beach where she found most of her fossils. The word is that you have a better chance of finding something when the weather is unsettled at low tide. In summer you may just be in need of a blissful few hours by the sea. The Cobb is an fabled landmark, a powerful harbour wall that you may know from Meryl Streep&#8217;s the French Lieutenant&#8217;s Woman, and was also described in Persuasion by Jane Austin, who lived in Lyme Regis for a time. In which case, Cobb beach is the spot for you, a spotless pebble beach on with calm seas that are transparent when the sun&#8217;s out. "
Christchurch Priory,"If you&#8217;re in Bournemouth there&#8217;s no reason not to board the train for the town of Christchurch, just a brief jaunt to the east. This town combines unblemished countryside, a gorgeous old quarter and first-rate beaches with a harbour at the confluence of two rivers. There&#8217;s so much to discover in the area that you&#8217;d be better off hiring a bike to get from one beautiful place to the next. You can go for a restorative walk by Highcliffe beach, try crab-fishing at Mudeford Quay or explore the ruins of the Constable&#8217;s House, an original Norman building. Best of all could be Christchuch Priory, a glorious medieval monastery that survived Henry VIII&#8217;s Dissolution by becoming a parish church in the 1500s. "
"The Pier, Swanage","In wonderful scenery, Swanage is a seaside town with a beach that is up there with the best in the county. The beach has soft white sands, and its shallow incline creates lots of shallow water for littler beach-goers to play in. On steep hillsides, the resort is very smart and has taken good care of its Victorian stone buildings which house tea rooms, pubs and fish &amp; chip shops. This being the Jurassic Coast there are natural wonders here. Old Harrys Rocks is the most majestic site in the area an ensemble of chalk outcrops. If you laugh in the face of vertigo you can walk along the eroded path on the narrow isthmus, where there&#8217;s a sheer drop on either side, to get a closer look at the vertical stack at the end. "
Shaftesbury,"A lovable country town, Shaftesbury is the only major hilltop community in Dorset, located more than 200 metres above sea level. Shaftesbury is well-accustomed to visitors and has its fair share of inns and bed &amp; breakfasts in wonderful period buildings. There has been a settlement at this site since at least Saxon times, and the former abbey was established in the 9th century. Pop into the museum next to the ruins that now decorate a sublime garden. Gold Hill meanwhile, encapsulates rural England perfectly. This steep cobbled street has stone thatched cottages and the most astounding views of the countryside. Gold Hill first came to the nation&#8217;s attention via a Ridley Scott commercial for Hovis bread, and it has since become a cherished landmark. "
Hall &amp; woodhouse Brewery,"In 1731 the town of Blandford was razed by fire. And this event is what grants it such an architectural unity today, as nearly everything you see in the centre is from the reconstruction in the years that followed, led by the uncommonly-named Bastard Brothers. So the pleasure of visiting Blandford lies in navigating its genteel Georgian streets, particularly around the baroque town hall and corn exchange, which are both Grade I-listed. There&#8217;s a Fire Monument in the marketplace to commemorate the fire, and the town museum has interesting exhibits about the grand rebuild. An absolute must-do in around Blandford is the Hall &amp; Woodhouse brewery, in business since 1777 and famed for its Tanglefoot bitter. "
Durdle Door,"Comprising both East and West Lulworth, this area in the middle of the Jurassic Coast has some of the UNESCO site&#8217;s most heart-lifting seascapes. The most inspiring of these is Durdle Door, a natural arch facing a secluded sandy bay. The arch is set off by the more resistant limestone, which climbs above Durdle Door to the east and is also spectacular when viewed from Man O&#8217; War Bay next door. Lulworth Cove is majestic too, rated as one of the South&#8217;s seven natural wonders, and forming an almost perfect bowl protected by rugged rocks. Put Lulworth Castle on your itinerary as well: Even though it has a brawny appearance, this 17th-century building was always more of a stately home than a fortress, and has seen a lot of fascinating events in its time. "
"Wareham, Dorset","Few English towns can claim to be defended by their Anglo-Saxon walls. But Wareham can make that brag, and if you&#8217;re an amateur historian you have to take a tour of these tall earthen banks. The walls are actually Roman in origin, but the Saxons beefed them up during the reign of Alfred the Great to keep out the Danes. There are information boards on the way to point out the sites of ancient skirmishes and bloody executions. A little way from Wareham are the eerie but beautiful ruins of Corfe Castle, where large chunks of the keep and imperious gatehouses remain. "
"Portland Castle, Isle of Portland","You&#8217;ll be leaving Dorset&#8217;s soft and forgiving countryside behind when you cross the tombolo at Chesil Beach onto Portland, a huge plate of Jurassic limestone. This is a craggy, elongated island, four miles in length and exposed to the elements. Some of the world&#8217;s most famous landmarks are made from stone quarried at this very place: Buckingham Palace, St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral and even the United Nations headquarters in New York feature Portland Stone. The limestone is a big attraction for adventure sports fanatics who come to climb and abseil on the rocks. For everyone else there&#8217;s uplifting walks, energising coastal scenery and sights like Portland Castle, an artillery fort commissioned by Henry VIII in 1539. "
"West Bay, Bridport","This town has two parts, the inland Bridport, an agreeable market town in hilly countryside, and West Bay, an uncommonly charming fishing harbour on the coast. The town is very visitor-friendly and has a good selection of one-of-a-kind shops and restaurants to keep you around a little longer. And then the coastal section is a traditional port, limestone cliffs and a tempting sandy beach. Fossil-hunting is also on the menu in this town, and the Bridport Tourist Information Centre can give you tips to make sure your hunt is as successful as possible. "
"Royal Pavilion, Brighton","The largest city in the county, Brighton is loved by tourists and the home of Britain&#8217;s largest LBGT community outside London. Visitors are seduced by the city&#8217;s history, as well as Brighton&#8217;s youthful  and creative character. There&#8217;s infamous nightlife and loads of leftfield, alternative shops and cafes, but also all of the old-time pleasures of an English seaside resort, as the Palace Pier makes clear. With minarets and onion domes, The Royal Pavilion is a whimsical palace built for the future George IV while he was still a prince in late-1700s. It was inspired by Indian and Islamic styles, fashionable during the days of the empire. You have to go in for a tour, and with the help of an audio-guide you&#8217;ll get insights about the opulent lifestyle of the Prince Regent. "
"Mermaid Street, Rye","Historic Rye clings to a hill between the Rivers Rother and Brede, close to where they enter the sea and was an important port in days gone by. The higher, older part of the town, known as the citadel is a dream to explore on foot. There are steep, winding cobblestone streets and their weatherboard houses are still redolent of the 18th-century smugglers who planned their capers in this town. There are old fortifications up here from when Rye was one of the Cinque Ports. Rye Castle is a museum giving you a window on the town&#8217;s truly fascinating history, as does the excellent Rye Heritage Centre. For some beach time hit Camber Sands, possibly the best beach on the English Channel coast. "
Lewes,"The county town of East Sussex, Lewes is heaving with historical and cultural importance. Keere Street is the place to dive into Lewes&#8217; old quarter, with its cobblestones and medieval timber-framed houses. Scramble up to Lewes Castle, constructed right after the conquest and with a great museum, and see the home that Anne of Cleves was given in her divorce from Henry VIII.  Glyndebourne is a country house that has become synonymous in England with opera, and has a calendar of performances in the summer that are part of aristocratic society&#8217;s &#8220;summer season&#8221;. The intervals last for more than an hour and give spectators time to picnic on the beautiful lawns. Also associated with high culture is Charleston, a gorgeous farmhouse where members of the Bloomsbury Group of artists and writers lived and worked. "
Hastings,"This town has a distinct look for East Sussex, because it&#8217;s right where the sandstone Weald enters the English Channel. So the cliffs that rise menacingly behind the town have a reddish brown colour. These bluffs were handy for smugglers, who were able to dig networks of tunnels for storing contraband and evading the authorities. These are now one of Hastings&#8217; top attractions. Also must-dos are the cliff railways, two of the steepest funiculars in the country. And you can&#8217;t pass up a visit to the old town at the base of the cliffs, an area of winding streets, painted weatherboard houses and inns where grizzled seafarers would have drunk in centuries past. "
Battle Abbey,"A momentous episode in English history unfolded right here in 1066, when William the Conqueror defeated Harold II to begin the Norman conquest of England. As soon as England was under Norman yoke, a Benedictine abbey was built on the battleground as penance for all of the violence of the conquest. The abbey church has been a ruin since the 1500s, but there&#8217;s a stone on the ground where the high alter used to be marking the spot where Harold fell. Over time a community took shape around the abbey, eventually giving us the sweet little town we see now. There&#8217;s a market in front of the abbey every Friday and Saturday and a high street lined with artisan shops, tea rooms and pubs. "
Eastbourne,"This town is like a more sedate and grown-up version of Brighton, and first came to society&#8217;s attention when the Children of George III holidayed here in the 1780s. There&#8217;s a beach, three-tiered promenade and elegant Victorian pier, but few of the amusements that are a fixture of many English seaside towns. Instead the foreshore is fringed by imposing regency townhouses and hotels, and there are classy amenities like the bandstand and three sumptuous old theatres. A mile or two southwest of Eastbourne towers the awesome Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in the country, at more than 160 metres. This landmark has been the subject of sea shanties since at least the 17th century. Spare some time for Eastbourne Redoubt, a coastal fort built during the Napoleonic Wars and restored as a museum. "
St Leonards-on-Sea,"Originally a different town, St Leonards was absorbed by Hastings in the 1800s but has managed to keep a distinct identity. This district has a looser, artier feel for its studios, vintage stores, stylish cafes and antiques shops. Norman Road and Mercatoria best demonstrate this amiable match of creativity and scruffiness. If you love regency architecture then St Leonards will definitely be your kind of place as most of the original town was plotted in one go in the early-1800s. And then on the seafront be dazzled by the gargantuan Marine Court, an art deco apartment block from 1937 designed to resemble an ocean liner. "
Seaford,"In medieval times Seaford had one of the south&#8217;s most active ports, but the town went into decline when the harbour silted up. Later the Victorians discovered the long pebble beaches and a second era of prosperity arrived. In the early-1800s England made plans to cope with what seemed like an inevitable land invasion by Napoleon. The Martello tower built as a defence is in fine nick and holds an informative museum about this period. Just east of the town, the chalk valleys of the South Downs meet the sea in the most epic fashion. Rising and falling off into the distance are the Seven Sisters, a chain of undulating chalk cliffs best viewed from Seaford Head. "
Hove,"Belonging to the same conurbation as Brighton, but with a very different character, Hove is a place where people settle when they&#8217;ve had enough of Brighton&#8217;s bustle. This town is an altogether grander and more genteel place, with regal boulevards and streets of stuccoed and whitewashed four-storey regency townhouses. Church Road is the main thoroughfare in Hove, underpinning the town&#8217;s sense of prosperity. The pebble beach is traced by the promenade that will lead you all the way to Brighton, and there&#8217;s a small amusement park for kids and the Hove Museum and Art Gallery recalls life in 19th-century Hove. At the County Cricket Ground you can catch the occasional England one-day international match from the comfort of a bench or deck chair. "
Alfriston,"This village in the lush Cuckmere Valley is as twee as it gets, and has lots of fun surprises. Take the village lockup, where offenders would have been imprisoned overnight and made from local flint. On the high street are sweet shops, tea rooms, a vintage bookshop and half-timbered pubs. The most endearing of these may be the Star Inn, with roots going back to the 14th century and where a notorious smuggling gang used to hang out in the 1800s. The wattle and daub Alfriston Clergy house is also from the 14th century, and has timber framing and a thatched roof. It was sold to the National Trust in 1896 and became their first ever property. "
Bexhill-on-Sea,"Not just a place to visit on isolated hot days in the summer, Bexhill is the kind of seaside town where you could easily spend a night or two. There are several aspects to the resort&#8217;s allure, whether it&#8217;s the medieval old town of weatherboard and flint houses, or the Victorian resort, developed in the blink of an eye in the 1890s as a chic getaway for high society. The beaches are the biggest draw in July and August, but a lot of visitors come a long way to see the stunning De La Warr Pavilion. Now a modern art museum and cultural centre, the pavilion was one of England&#8217;s earliest modernist buildings, completed in 1935 with a fusion of the art deco and international styles. "
Pevensey Castle,"At one of the few gaps in East Sussex&#8217;s long wall of chalk cliffs lies the town of Pevensey and its seafront community Pevensey Bay. This was the exact location where the Normans landed in England in 1066. The seaside is all the better for its low-impact, village-like development and has a long string of pebble beaches. Move inland and you get to the old part of Pevensey, a town of pubs with names like &#8220;Smugglers Inn&#8221; and cute weatherboard houses. Pevensey Castle is from the earliest days of the Norman Invasion, but even  more interesting is that they simply occupied and enhanced the ruins of the 3rd-century Roman fort, Anderitum. The site is a ruin but has more than enough of its keep and outer walls to keep you riveted. "
Winchelsea,"This historic village has an interesting story to tell: Up to 1287 it was a large harbour, importing wine from Gascony and home to possibly thousands of people until it was destroyed all at once by a flood. In some ways that&#8217;s good for us because Winchelsea was moved to higher ground and constructed in the space of months during the reign of Edward I. It&#8217;s easy to see the &#8220;new&#8221; town&#8217;s grid layout, as well as the defensive walls, as three of the old gates remain. These are worthwhile sights, as is the Church of St Thomas the Martyr for its fabulous stained glass. Buried in the churchyard is the famous 20th-century humorist and writer Spike Milligan. "
"Batemans, Burwash","Set in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Burwash is a small but lively village in enchanting countryside. The high street has charming bed &amp; breakfasts, country pubs and specialty shops. The village is best known as the residence of Rudyard Kipling, who won the Nobel Prize for literature at the turn of the 20th century and wrote the Jungle Book, among other works. His home, Bateman&#8217;s, is a handsome Jacobean house from the 1600s and is open to the public. The interior is like a time capsule, left exactly how it was after the author&#8217;s wife bequeathed it to the National Trust when she passed away in 1939. "
Newhaven Fort,"Most people&#8217;s experience of Newhaven will be departing for, or arriving from, the French port of Dieppe. But if you have time on your hands you could definitely use it to poke around some of Newhaven&#8217;s sights. The marquee attraction is Newhaven Fort, the largest defensive structure ever built in Sussex. This is a Palmerston Fort, constructed when France was deemed a real threat once more during Napoleon III&#8217;s rule in the mid-1800s. The extent of the underground tunnels as part of the caponier is incredible. Paradise Park is one for the kids, with exhibits that help bring dinosaurs to life, large adventure playgrounds and a miniature railway. Parents can content themselves with the tranquil gardens and cafe. "
"Jesus Backside Beach, Dili, East Timor","Dili is East Timor’s largest city where you’ll find new restaurants, textile shops, produce markets, and seafood stands amongst thatch roofed homes. On the beaches of Dili, you can enjoy freshly cooked seafood, drink a coconut, and watch whales swim along the coastline during migration season. Scuba diving in Dili is known to be great all year and is home to a variety of corals, blue moray eels, trevally, scorpion fish reef sharks, and more. Most directions around Dili are in relation to Cristo Rei, a 27-meter-tall statue of Jesus Christ that overlooks the city. Cristo Rei is the second largest statue of Jesus Christ in the world. While in Dili, the effort taken to walk up to Cristo Rei is worth the panoramic views of the city and the sea. "
Atauro Island,"Thirty kilometers from the beaches of Dili is Atauro Island, accessible only via boat ride. Here, you’ll find world-class diving, walking paths, and are likely to catch a glimpse of the resident pod of dolphins. Atauro means “goat” in the local language, so expect to see many there too. During both Portuguese and Indonesian occupation, Atauro Island acted as the local jail. Today, its untouched beaches are perfect for snorkeling and diving while inland you can find trails that venture through the cleared rainforest to lively villages famous for selling wooden sculpture and crafts. For a price, you can also try your hand at traditional fishing using handmade goggles and spear guns. "
Baucau,"Baucau almost seems as if it could be two separate cities. In Old Town, you’ll find Portuguese colonial architecture while New Town hosts new buildings with an Indonesian influence. Stop by the bright yellow government building, formerly the town’s community market. On the south side, visit the stunning buildings of Venilale and explore the caves created by Japanese military during WWII. Further south, are the villages of Ossu and Viqueque, where you can swim in freshwater rivers, explore natural caves, and gaze at churning waterfalls. "
"Suai, East Timor","Suai is the south coast of East Timor’s main village, where the livelihood of most residents revolve around fishing. In Suai, you can watch traditional dancing, walk over the town’s smooth sandstone beaches, and explore the River Tafara. If you’re interested in the darker side of East Timor’s history, you should visit the town’s main attraction, Our Lady of Fatima Church, where you can find a memorial devoted to the infamous church massacre that took the lives of 200 people. "
"Lautem, East Timor","With a thriving bird population, beautiful beaches, and cave drawings, the Lautem region is a perfect mix of culture and nature. Almost defying gravity, the houses in this region are often placed atop narrow stilts, built completely with thin bamboo, wood, and dried grass. Because the Lautem is so undeveloped, you’re likely to have a beach or nature path all to yourself. For the regions highlights, visit the beach of Tutuala, and the villages of Viqueque and Lospalos. "
"Maubisse, East Timor","Maubisse is one of East Timor’s most popular vacation spots for international tourists and those residing in Dili alike. The town’s only hotel, Pousada de Maubisse, offers charming views but has not been renovated since the 1950s. Once again, as everywhere in East Timor, expect a memorable and adventurous experience over a luxurious one. For active hikers planning to trek Mt. Ramelau, Maubisse is the best town to stay in as a base. "
Lake Ira Lalaro,"The largest lake in East Timor, Lake Ira Lalaro is perfect for mountain biking around and exploring for a day trip. However, keep all of your activities land-based and avoid swimming as the lake is also home to the country’s largest crocodile population. Be sure to bring enough food and water, as shops around the area are sparse. "
"Mount Matebian, East Timor","Mt. Matebian is one of the East Timor’s most sacred sites, with thousands of pilgrims making their way to the base every All Souls Day. Mt. Matebian is topped by a statue of Jesus Christ. If you’re interested in hiking to the top, take note that you’ll likely need more than twelve hours to hike to the summit and back. The mountain often goes by two nicknames. Often, it’s called the Mountain of Souls because locals believe that this mountain is where the souls of their ancestors reside. Alternatively, it’s called Mountain of the Dead because of military activity that took place during WW II, when Japanese forces created a series of caves and tunnels – and killed many people in the process. Due to its history, Mt. Matebian is a touch point for East Timor culture. "
Jaco Island,"Completely removed from any semblance of a crowd or tourism, Jaco Island is an offbeat oasis of white sand and an active marine life of reef sharks, sea turtles, dolphins, and technicolor fish. If you want to visit Jaco Island, hire a local fisherman to shuttle you from the mainland and back for the day (they might even catch you your dinner and prepare it for you for a small fee). Since Jaco Island is sacred, it is largely uninhabited. There is only a small guesthouse and camping area for those who want to spend the night. Bring all food and supplies. "
"Same, East Timor","This village inland of the country’s coastline is a located between lush trees and offers an authentic look into small-town life in East Timor. Those in search of a souvenir will be happy rummaging through the local market, renowned for its crafts and tai, a type of textile. "
"Betano, East Timor","Betano, an untouched black-sand beach, was once a Timorese kingdom. Today,Use Betano as a base to explore the nearby mangrove swamps spanning all the way to nearby Viqueque. Betano is often cited as a favorite stretch by Tour de Timor riders, who mountain bike the length of the entire country in just five days. "
Mount Ramelau,"Hikers must visit Mt. Ramelau, where you can stay at the base in the town of Hatubuilico. The hike from bottom to top takes around six hours, with most hikers leaving before sunrise. After three hours of hiking, you’ll be greeted by a statue of the Virgin Mary, another one of the country’s famous religious icons. Near the summit of Mt. Ramelau is a church frequented by locals who wish to deepen their faith. "
"Com, East Timor","If you’re wanting a more resort-style stay in East Timor, come to Com, a small beach town on the eastern end of the country. The main road traces the coastline offering a variety of guesthouses and restaurants. Grab a glass of white wine and enjoy sitting at the beach and enjoying sunshine. Though swimming is off the table due to crocodiles, you can go shopping, fishing, explore the colonial-era Portuguese buildings, and hike. For upscale accommodation, stay at Com Beach Resort, who also offer space for camping. "
Marobo Hot Springs,"Hidden and rarely visited, Marobo is perfect for a day trip from the town of Maliana. Take a dip in the Marobo Hot Springs, a natural spring on mountain foothills. To get to the hot springs, you’ll pass through Timorese homesteads until you arrive at the ruins of a resort. Though the resort is gone, a large pool, mud bath, and mineral bath are kept in full working condition, creating an eerie atmosphere. "
Nino Konis National Park,"Home to over 250 species of birds, wildlife, trekking trails, and more, this lowland rainforest is perfect for adventure seekers obsessed with nature. Keep an eye out for the Yellow-crested Cockatoo, a beautiful and intelligent bird that is critically endangered. Uniquely, the national park also incorporates a large portion of the Coral Triangle, a rich marine area for diving and snorkeling. "
Hull Marina,"Hull has been a port since at least the 1100s, and in the last 10 years or so has become one of England&#8217;s trendiest towns. It&#8217;s still a major port, but since the decline of England&#8217;s fishing industry Hull has evolved into a centre for the arts as well. There are some really happening areas to investigate, particularly around the old merchants&#8217; warehouses in the Trinity Quarter. This whole neighbourhood has been thoroughly transformed and now has cafes, stylish boutiques and lots of other great stuff to reward an inquisitive visitor. There&#8217;s also an enormous amount of museum and attractions in Hull. We&#8217;ll name the Maritime Museum, Streetlife Museum of Transport, the Deep (a  first-rate aquarium) and the Ferens Art Gallery, which hosted the Turner Prize in 2016. But that&#8217;s just for starters! "
Beverley,"Historic and just wonderful to behold, East Yorkshire&#8217;s county town is the kind of place first-time visitors fall in love with. The pinnacle is of course the 13th-century Beverley Minster, an outstanding example of medieval workmanship on a  large scale, bigger even than many cathedrals. There&#8217;s a strong feeling of community here too, with people coming together to organise the annual folk festival in June, as well as beer and food festivals, the famous annual fair, Christmas market and a whole lot more. And try to be in town on Wednesdays or Saturdays for regular the market which remains a staple of local life. While there you could take a peek at the North Bar, a brick-built gate from the 1400s and the only surviving fragment of the town walls. "
Bridlington,"As the top resort in East Yorkshire, Bridlington has all the hallmarks of an English seaside escape. Think donkey rides, sandy beaches, a windswept promenade and charming little attractions like the Bondville Model Village. As is often the way, it&#8217;s the little ones who will get the most out of a destination like Bridlington, going for a trip on the &#8220;land train&#8221;, building sandcastles on the beach and having the time of their lives at the amusements and fairground rides. Older visitors will have their own fun exploring the older part of Bridlington, which took shape centuries before the seaside resort and is some way inland. "
Pocklington,"A respectable little market town, Pocklington has got plenty of personality and is in a useful location just a few minutes from the City of York. The town has cafes and tea rooms that spill out on to the pavement, and is a great place to potter around for a while. All Saints Church is the dominant landmark in the town, with a large tower from the 1400s and a nave mostly constructed 300 years before that. The best bet for a day out is Burnby Hall Gardens, where there&#8217;s a rockery, Victorian garden, shrubbery, walled garden and lakes with more than 100 varieties of water lily. "
Flamborough Lighthouse,"Loaded with man-made and natural splendour, Flamborough is next to an awesome headland in the north of the county. The obvious landmark at Flamborough Head is the lighthouse, which has been guiding maritime traffic for more than 200 years and can be entered during the summer. The chalk cliffs on the promontory are majestic and you&#8217;ll see little hints of human intervention: There&#8217;s an earlier lighthouse, from the 1600s, and dividing the headland from the mainland is the 3.2 kilometre Bronze Age dyke, which would have defended against attacks from the sea. The two beaches, North and South Landing are where invaders would have arrived, and both have a savage majesty about them. "
Hornsea,"On warm summer days Hornsea comes to life and brings in day-trippers from all over Yorkshire. There are caravan parks if you want to stay longer and take advantage  of the Blue Flag sandy beach, amusements and promenade, all complemented by fish and chip shops, tea rooms and the Floral Hall for old-time entertainment. Kids can befriend lambs and goats at the working Honeysuckle Farm, while the Hornsea Museum has lovely memorabilia from days gone by, like school desks, old shops signs and the once famous Hornsea pottery. Hornsea Mere is a beautiful inland lake overlooked by Wassand Hall, a fine regency mansion. "
Goole,"Long described as the &#8220;Port in Green Fields&#8221;, Goole is a functioning port a long way inland, at the south of the county. It started out shipping coal excavated in South Yorkshire, but decades after this industry died off it continues to grow as a busy container port. So there&#8217;s a scruffy dignity to Goole, and lots of relics of Victorian industry. One is a Tom Pudding Hoist, a titanic piece of machinery which would lift the old coal barges and tip their contents onto ships at the dock. It makes sense that the Yorkshire Waterways Museum should be in Goole, a riveting account of the canals and navigations in the region. "
Driffield,"This is the largest town in East Yorkshire&#8217;s Wolds, a chalk ridge that runs north to south in the county and is treasured for its grasslands, rolling scenery, ponds and villages. If your idea of a relaxation is discovering country estates and historic houses, Driffield will be up your street. There&#8217;s Sledmere House and its precisely trimmed parterres, and the distinguished Burton Agnes Hall, commissioned during the reign of Elizabeth I in the early-1600s and with a garden that has more than 3,000 plant species. And to fully appreciate the lovely rural landscapes, have a ramble along the Driffield Navigation or board the Yorkshire Wolds Railway, with steam trains puffing through these hills from April to October. "
Withernsea,"A modest seaside resort, Withernsea is the go-to destination for fish and chips and seafront strolls to blow the cobwebs away. The town is dwarfed by the Withernsea Lighthouse, which was built in the 1890s and decommissioned 40 years ago. Now it acts as a museum for the town, with little exhibits about the resort in Edwardian times and the Hollywood Golden Age actor Kay Kendall who was born in Withernsea. You can scale the 144 steps for fabulous coastal vistas and pop into the tea rooms for some warming refreshment. A few minutes down the coast is a Cold War relic at RAF Holmpton, where there&#8217;s a vast control bunker 30 metres underground that has recently been opened to the public. "
Bempton Cliffs,"A sleepy seaside village, the main event in Bempton is the Bempton Cliffs, which soar to more then 100 metres in places. Their hard chalk composition means they don&#8217;t erode easily and their many deep ridges afford an exceptional breeding ground for sea birds like puffins, guillemots, gannets, fulmars and kittiwakes. So this arresting stretch of coastline is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society of the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and a goldmine for birdwatchers or anyone with an affinity for nature. Back in the village the Bempton&#8217;s pond, the Mere, is an adorable place to have a picnic on grassy heath in the company of ducks and geese. "
"Quito, Ecuador","Cascading down the rugged slopes of Pichincha Volcano, the highest official capital city in the world is perhaps the biggest bucket-list destination in all of Ecuador. In 1978, the center of the city was designated as one of the first ever UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites, hailed for its lived-in pueblo homes and gilded Spanish plazas, painted colonial edifices and enchanting cobbled streets, each trodden by conquistadores and Incan imperialists alike. On the edges of town, the hillsides of El Panecillo give way to the soaring Andean peaks, mist-clad or snow-topped depending on the time of year. Meanwhile, Mercado Santa Clara and the various eateries pulse with local chatter and camarones and cuy (that’s guinea pig to you and me!) dishes, and La Carolina Park beats with bikers and football players alike. "
"Canoa, Ecuador","Once just a sleepy little fishing town rising from the mangroves and crawling dune vines on the Ecuadorian Pacific, Canoa now boasts a distinct air of confidence and panache. During the day, tanned locals canoe and kayak over the rollers, while surfers hone their skills on the challenging left-to-righters during the high-season (typically running from December through to spring). When night comes, the town’s clutch of Rasta bars and bamboo cocktail shacks comes alive with Pisco sours and the chatter of travelers, fusing a low-key hedonism with a bona fide South American beach town feel. "
"Montanita, Ecuador","Some two hours along the Pacific Coast from the southern, seaside metropolis of Guayaquil is where travelers will discover the good vibrations of Montanita; a salt-sprayed string of a town that’s made up largely of lean-to bars and bamboo shacks along the beach. Home to one of the most reliable and accessible surfing spots in the country, this one’s bursting to the brim with board rentals and surf teachers offering their services. Night time is the domain of Marley and the Wailers, while the sunsets bring out the yogis, who pepper the boulders and cliffs stretching and unwinding in the ocean breeze. In short, if you’re after a blast of Caribbean living and Cali free love in Ecuador (plus some great surf ops), this is the place to go! "
"Cotopaxi, Ecuador","Brooding and bubbling, mist-clad and snow-tipped, Cotopaxi is the great, hulking monster of the Ecuadorian backcountry. Although not the highest peak in the country (that honour goes to the colossal massif of Chimborazo), Cotopaxi lurches so high above the horizon that it can even be seen from the central districts of Quito when the mists clear. Climbers come in their droves to conquer the summit too, strapping on the crampons and wielding ice picks as they attempt to scale what is one of the few permanent ice fields on the Earth’s equatorial circumference. "
"Cuenca, Ecuador","Just like its Spanish namesake, Cuenca is a real beauty. Oozing colonial charm and elegance from every one of its neo-classical and baroque pores, the city is spiked with countless church spires and topped with the bulbous, coloured domes of the Catedral Nueva – photogenic in the extreme. Travelers head in to wander the tight-knit streets and enchanting 16th-century plazas here, gawping at the various churches and the perennial bougainvillea blooms that erupt around the Monastery of El Carmen de Asuncion and the like. And once you’ve checked off all the Spanish history, be sure to head north out of town, to where the crumbling remnants of Ingapirca pepper the hills of Canar Province. These are the largest known Incan remains in all of Ecuador. "
"Banos, Ecuador","Roaring cataracts cut their way through the ridges of the La Cordillera de los Llanganates on the edge of Banos, while bubbling hot springs issue plumes of steam into the misty jungles that dress the land. Trekking trails weave and turn all around the highlands that encompass the town, and mountain bikers enjoy kilometer upon kilometer of runs through the rainforests. Yes sir, Banos – the so-called ‘Gateway to the Amazon’ – is a real jewel (even if it’s ramshackle appearance and ad hoc rows of guesthouses and adventure guide establishments isn’t the prettiest South America has to offer!). "
"Otavalo, Ecuador","Set high in the Northern Sierra ranges north of Quito, the charming little backwater town of Otavalo has become a real gringo favourite in the last couple of decades. But its draws aren’t new. No sir, that buzzing marketplace, complete with its stacks of alpaca wools and colourful Quechua clothes, animist totems and reed-grass voodoo pieces, has been going for centuries, and the people here can trace their roots back to the pre-Incan tribes of the high Andean plateaus. Then there’s the backcountry, which lurches like a great backbone out of the earth with the peaks of Imbabura Volcano – another of Ecuador’s top climbing spots. "
"Atacames, Ecuador","Atacames is one of the first beach cities on the Ecuadorian Pacific arch. Pulsing and big, the town is quite different to the rustic bamboo resorts that pepper the shorelines to the south, however. The beach is wide and just a tad polluted, peppered with fishermen and al fresco discos that thump with Europop and reggae and salsa alike throughout the high season. But it’s precisely that earthy, hedonistic energy that pulls the crowds to Atacames, and locals love to head in from the Andes to party the night away with Pisco sours, mojitos and fast-food aplenty. "
"Guamote, Ecuador","Charming little Guamote is a patchwork of mud-brick homes and breeze-block buildings, smiling indigenous people and sleepy plazas, where the native tongue of Ecuador’s central Andean tribes still rings between the adobe walls and the looming central ranges rise like bulwarks on all sides. Travelers head here to seek out the legendary Thursday market, when Guamote erupts with curious trinkets, hand-carved totems and multi-coloured frocks, while others come to wax up the walking boots and hit the trails or bridal paths, which weave out of town to the sparkling Lagunas de Atillo and the volcano-topped Sangay National Park. "
Galapagos Islands,"It was in 1835 that one Charles Darwin and his ship, the HMS Beagle, drifted in to these far-flung isles some 906 kilometers west of the Ecuadorian mainland. What the great scientist found there was to inspire one of the most revolutionary theories of all time. Yes sir, from blue-footed boobies to red-billed tropicbirds, colossal albatrosses to fur seals and bottlenose dolphins, red bats and flamingos all peppering the volcanic slopes and windswept beaches here, it’s hardly surprising that Galapagos was &#8211; and is &#8211; famed mainly for its great biodiversity. Today, travelers come to spy out the arrays of wondrous wildlife, scuba dive in the reefs and explore the otherworldly landscapes of the archipelago’s hinterland. "
"Tena, Ecuador","Okay, so Tena might not have the gilded colonial churches and pretty plazas of its mountaintop compadres to the west, but it does have something that the likes of Quito and Cuenca can only dream of: primeval rainforest. Yes sir, perched just on the edge of the Amazon basin, this lively little transport town is a hubbub of backpackers and intrepid types, all eager to bathe in the gushing waterfalls that crash through the wilds outside of town, or hit the kayaks and rafts and white water rapids of the legendary Jatunyacu River. Caving is also big here, with oodles of tunnels and karst caverns hiding beneath the undergrowth around the pretty backwater of Archidona. "
Vilcabamba,"Sandwiched between the beautiful reaches of the Podocarpus National Forest and the mythic Mount Mandango, Vilcabamba was once the royal retreat of Incan VIPs. Today all are welcome, and travelers flock to the highland town between the ridges of southern Loja to enjoy everything from horseback riding in the wilds to hiking, spa retreats and pleasant year-round temperatures and breezes. It’s thought that the inhabitants – indelibly lovely people with a graceful, welcoming air about them – live longer than most. Perhaps it’s the potent herbal remedies they cook up, or maybe it’s the lingering spectres of the pre-Columbian kings and spirits in the hills. Who knows? "
"Mindo, Ecuador","Tucked in a valley of cloud forests and Andean summits, Mindo is pretty much universally liked. It’s now one of the major stop-offs on the gringo trail through Ecuador, offering backpackers and outdoorsy types a taste of the wild mountain reaches and the tropical jungles that burst up from where the Chocoan plains leave off. The town itself is an enchantingly haphazard array of bamboo, timber homes and guesthouses, living amidst the Mindo-Nambillo Ecological Reserve, which encompasses the streets here in a patchwork of roaring waterfalls and chirping tree canopies, winding walking trails and tubing rivers, white water rapids and rolling highland meadows. It’s all beautiful stuff! "
"Guayaquil, Ecuador","Guayaquil is the great southern metropolis, Ecuador’s largest city, and a throbbing port town with multicultural influences coming out of its ears. It can be found straddling the delta of the Guayas River as it spread out to meet the Pacific Ocean; a patchwork of breeze-block barrios and ice-cream-coloured hillside homes that finds its zenith on the bubbling Malecon walkway along the water. Here, ceviche holes-in-the-wall throw out homemade seafood salads and students straight out of Guayaquil’s many lecture halls sip beers as the sun sets against the sea. Meanwhile, the Zona Rosa and Penas districts pulse with nightclubs and discos, and there’s always somewhere to sip a cheeky tequila in the early hours! "
"Zaruma, Ecuador","Villa Real de San Antonio del Cerro de Oro de Zaruma (that’s just Zaruma for short) crowns the hillsides of the Vizcaya just a little inland from Ecuador’s rolling coastal plains. It’s a fascinating place, awash with ramshackle old miners’ homes and the regal republican mansions of the prospectors and foremen who made it large in the gold mines of the Andes. Today, travelers can opt to descent into the subterranean depths where the seams were once chiselled away, while others will simply sip coffee in the earthy cafes that line the streets of Zaruma’s downtown, sampling the flavoursome tigrillo plates of plantain and campo cheeses the locals are known for. "
Sinai Peninsula,"Sinai is a place of sundrenched seaside resorts.  It’s a major holiday destination and over the years has really developed a personality unlike the rest of Egypt. It’s a beautiful area and as soon as you see the empty desert stretching for miles away from you, you’ll absolutely agree. Historically, there is a great deal of religious importance here and for centuries Sinai served as a crossroads for change and progress.  Once you’ve soaked up all you can of the beach life, step away from the holiday makers and see what the heart of the Sinai Peninsula is about. In the mountains you’ll find the Bedouin working to preserve their traditions as modern life moves forward. It’s an enchanting place at the top of everyone’s must see list. "
Sinai Coast,"This historic region is best known for the sandy beaches and gorgeous coral reefs.  In fact, one of the most famous diving spots in the Red Sea is in Ras Mohammed.  It’s consistently rated as one of the top five dives on Earth.  Not only will you see plenty of fish and the coral walls, you’ll also get a look at the remains of the Jolanda – a freight that sank there in 1980.  You’ll also love the Gardens, which are really more like three spots in one.  Far Garden is where you’ll find a colourful overhang located in deep waters known as the Cathedral.  The Middle Garden slopes down toward a large bed of sandy trails, and Near Garden is where you’ll find an astounding chain of pinnacles. The culture in the region is primarily Bedouin and locals will love telling you about the intricate history of these isolated shores. "
Ras Mohammed,"Named for nearby cliffs that form the shape of a man’s profile, Ras Mohammed National Park sees over 50,000 guests per year.  The coast line is considered some of the most desirable in the Red Sea.  Guests are given a taste of some of Earth’s most stunning coral reef ecosystems. There are about 1000 species of fish in the Red Sea, and almost all of them can be found within the park.  You’ll have the chance to sport hammerheads, whale sharks, and manta rays. Be sure to explore the entire park, which includes the surrounding desert, Tiran Island, and the coast between Nabq Protectorate, and Sharm el-Sheikh harbour. "
Red Sea,"This is one for the history buffs.  The Red Sea coast of Egypt is home to many important sites in early Christianity.  Prehistoric trade routes cross the region and ancient rock art dots the land.  Don’t miss the desert ruins in this surprising area. You’ll enjoy the loud and over-the-top city of Hurghada, the Eastern Desert, and even more great diving.  The area is now famous for the incredible holiday packages and that can be off-putting for some.  But all you need to do is scratch beneath the surface to find the many hidden gems of the Red Sea coast. "
"Fort Qaitbey at Alexandria, Egypt","Although no signs of Alexander the Great remain in modern day Alexandria, this city is the stuff of legends.  The list of unbelievable aspects of this city are long:  once home to Queen Cleopatra, the Pharaohs lighthouse (one of the seven wonders of the ancient world), and the Great Library. These days, Alexandria is a key commercial hub for Egypt and the cultural renaissance is alive and well.  It’s now home to writers and poets who are struggling to find their voice in an uncertain political climate.  The modern library is a landmark of innovation for the entire country. Be sure to plan enough time to cover the historical circuit in order to visit the museums and monuments.  Then spend a day or two relaxing in an old world café and soaking up the atmosphere. "
Hurghada,"Originally a destination spot for diving, the city has suffered in recent years from overdevelopment.  But a gem like Hurghada is not to be tossed aside lightly and many NGO’s have come in with an aim to restore this stretch of coastline.  Many visitors love to combine a stop in Hurghada with a tour of the Nile Valley sites.  You’ll find three main areas to explore.  In the north is Ad-Dahar which is considered by most to be the most Egyptian part of the city thanks to the lively souq in the neighbourhood.  There’s also the Sigala area that hosts plenty of shops and restaurants as well as the lovely Gebel al-Afish mountain. Along the coast is the resort strip home to more upmarket resorts and hotels. "
Luxor,"There is very little on Earth that can compare with the breathtaking spectacle of the monuments in Luxor.  So much has survived from ancient Thebes and most visitors are blown away by the beauty of the place.  The Nile River flows directly between the modern city and the necropolis, tombs, and temples on the west bank.  There is a great deal of history to discover in Luxor as you explore these unprecedented archaeological sites. "
Dahab,"One of the most popular beach destinations in the entire Middle East, Dahab is laid back and relaxed. One an enclave for beach bums seeking a secluded shack on the beach, this tourist village boasts safe diving, a great tourism infrastructure, family friendly activities and accommodations, and a little something for almost every kind of traveller. Many people use Dahab as their base for excursions into the desert or Mt. Sinai. The atmosphere is a fusion of hippie chic and the entire town is so charm that some people rearrange their plans to spend their entire vacation here. "
Suez Canal,"Cutting through the Suez sand for 163 kilometres is the Suez Canal.  This amazing feat of engineering separates Africa from Asia and Egypt from Sinai. Completed during a period of grand dreams for the Egyptians, today the area has a distinctive, if dated, architecture and atmosphere. It’s not a big tourist draw, but there is a ton to learn about modern Egyptian history here.  Be sure to visit the canal-side towns of Ismailia and Port Said to experience a slower paced and more relaxed Egypt. "
Cairo,"The Egyptians call Cairo Umm ad-Dunya, or the Mother of the Word. With a population of over 20 million, Cairo comes with all the draw backs of the world’s biggest cities, but it also has an energy that’s fantastic and surprisingly charming.  Check out the pyramids of Giza, the plethora of palaces and grand avenues, and the many stunning mosques. The capital of Egypt is located on the Nile River and at its heart is Tahrir Square with its incredible Egyptian Museum where you can see the artefacts collected from King Tut’s tomb. Don’t miss Cairo Tower, which stands at almost 190 metres and offers astounding views of the city. "
Pyramids of Giza,"The most famous structures are easily the Pyramids of Giza and there is nothing like getting a close up view.  Guarded by the magnificent Sphinx, these ancient tombs have been drawing visitors for centuries.  Truly, no trip to Egypt is complete until you’ve been there. Showcasing the power and ambition of the pharaohs, you’ll see keystone monument, the Pyramid of Cheops. Also known as the Great Pyramid, it was built for Pharaoh Khufu by over 100,000 men for three months out of every year. If you like, you can tour inside and view the incredible masonry and sarcophagus for yourself. "
Valley of the Kings,"Sitting on the west bank of the Nile River, opposite modern day Luxor, is the Valley of the Kings.  Over the course of 500 years tombs where built here for many nobles and pharaohs of the time.  So far, over 60 tombs and rooms have been discovered – one tomb is so grand that it has over 120 rooms! Unfortunately almost all the tombs were robbed at some point but it is still easy to get a sense of the majesty of these places and of the lives of the men and women buried here. Roughly 18 of the tombs can be visited, though you’ll need to do a bit of planning ahead of time, as officials open and close tombs on a fairly regular basis. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1979, roughly 5,000 tourists visit each day. "
El-Hassana Dome,"North of Cairo is El-Hassana, a natural rock formation that was created when Cretaceous limestone broke through the Earth’s surface.  The dome was formed roughly 50 million years ago and the folding and contorting of the crust is remarkable.  You can even spot marine fossils in the formations. "
"El-Ahrash, Egypt","If you’re looking for a bit of natural beauty during your visit, be sure to stop by El-Ahrash.  The name means “the bushes” in Arabic and this region features Mediterranean coastal sand dunes that reach up to 60 metres high.  It’s a lovely little eco-system, well worth an afternoon excursion if you’re on the Sinai Coast. "
Al-Azhar Park,"The hillside area of Al-Azhar Park is surrounded by some of the most interesting historic areas of Islamic Cairo. Perhaps the most popular destination, the park is located in the heart of this historic area and provides a phenomenal view of the city. Created in 1984 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the basic idea behind the park is the Islamic belief that all people are caretakers of our planet. Visitors will love this oasis as they tour the city’s monuments and neighbourhoods. "
Malabo,"A curious fusion of colonial traditions meets between the age-stained, salt-washed architectural pieces that pepper Malabo&#8217;s heart. They stand as testimony to the city&#8217;s – the soon-to-be-replaced capital of Equatorial Guinea – long history, and its deep-rooted European heritage. Visitors can come and stroll the streets to see the gorgeous neo-Gothic spires of the Cathedral of Santa Isabel, and enchanting little Spanish-esque casas along the neighborhood roads. There&#8217;s also a university and a Cultural Center, ringed by a smattering of clubs and fried-plantain curry houses, all cascading down towards the clifftops above the Atlantic. "
Monte Alén National Park,"Ah, the vast wildernesses of the Monte Alén National Park: perhaps the single most important area of outstanding natural beauty in West Africa you&#8217;ve never heard of. And while the humid rainforests and gushing courses of the Uoro River here remain an off-the-beaten-track option, those who do come are reaping the rewards: empty trekking trails; personal safari packages, and an untainted experience of the African wilds &#8211; just three aspects that come to mind! There&#8217;s mile upon mile of maintained hiking paths here, along with more wildlife than you can shake an Equatorial peanut-butter chicken dish at. Think uber-rare goliath frogs, gorillas, elephants, crocodiles and chimps… "
Cascades of Moca,"Clutching the rugged volcanic ridges of the Moca Valley on the southern edges of Bioko, the namesake town of Moca is a bucolic picture of wild Equatorial Guinea. Home to the people of the Buki tribe, it sits almost in harmony with the great cloud-topped peaks that rise around it. And talking of peaks, they are also the reason most travelers pass this way. They come to hike to the craggy, monkey-dotted reaches of the Cascades of Moca, or to witness the shimmering blues of lakes Biao and Loreta, topping out in the old volcanic calderas on the highlands. Bring the walking boots – this one promises to be outdoorsy! "
"San Antonio de Ureca, Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea","No one can quite figure out why little San Antonio de Ureca hasn&#8217;t boomed with ecotourism yet. After all, it was here, in the late 1990s, that Spanish conservationists first took it to the illicit trade of endangered turtle eggs; and won! Today, the same villager patrols are in place to police the sands and pebble beaches that ring the little village, helping to save the endangered sea turtles that make the Atlantic waters their home. That&#8217;s not it though, because this little town of low-rise shacks and mud roads sits in the shadow of the mighty San Carlos Caldera, is imbued with gushing waterfalls, and surrounded by countless hiking routes to boot! "
Bata,"Ebbing and flowing with the tide of political inclinations and oil booms, this onetime capital of Equatorial Guinea is now a standard stop off on the route through the country. With more than 170,000 people calling it home, it&#8217;s by far EQ&#8217;s largest city; a fact reflected in the lively nighlife scene, and the buzzing fish and craft markets that coalesce each day around the port sides. Bata Cathedral is the main sight, oozing a taste of Spanish character in the heart of town, while there&#8217;s also an airport and regular services to Cameroon and the city of Malabo by boat. "
Evinayong,"The provincial capital of Centro Sur is a place to glimpse the bustle of day-to-day life that carries on between the jungle-dressed hills that dominate the vast proportion of Rio Muni (the Equatorial mainland). Tin shacks and rain-buffeted palms line the streets, while a clutch of little drinking joints host crowds of chattering locals. There&#8217;s also a local market that&#8217;s packed with multi-coloured veg and legumes and fruits plucked straight from the fields. And if you&#8217;re looking to go outdoors, then the spot is also neatly sandwiched almost equidistance between the national parks of Monte Alén and Altos de Nsork! "
Luba,"Long the chosen departure point for the countless tonnes of logs that stream down the highland highways from the forests that hug Caldera de San Carlos in the Bioko highlands above, Luba is now slowly developing into something much more. Touting beautiful coastline and excellent access to up-coming eco-tourism and adventure hotspots like aforementioned Moca, it&#8217;s drawing a different type of traveler these days. Add to that the shimmering sands of Arena Blanca – the only white-sand beach on the island – and all the swaying coconut palms and salt-sprayed boulders that go with it, and it’s easy to see why! "
Djibloho,"Slowly transforming from a patchwork of foundation ditches and gritty construction sites and beginning to shoulder its way above the verdant swathes of jungle that dominate the hinterlands of Wele-Nzas Province in the very heart of Equatorial Guinea, the city of Djibloho remains just an embryo of what’s planned. Also called Oyala, this perfectly-organised city of crisscrossing grids and all-new conference centers is intended as the future capital of the nation. Once complete, it will aspire to champion a symbiotic relationship between modern living and the country&#8217;s natural environment and heritage. Watch this space! "
Mbini,"The gateway to the coastal region of Rio Muni and the winding channels of the mighty Benito River – the longest in the country – the ocean-side town of Mbini boasts some great views over the estuaries that crash into the Atlantic here. At once a marine and river fishing town, it&#8217;s perhaps one of the best places to sample Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s famed seafood. There&#8217;s also a smattering of resort hotels to kick-back in, a row of powdery, sandy beaches, and some great broadside panoramas of the rising peaks of Monte Alén in the distance (only on clear days!). "
Annobon Island,"A whole island all on its own, set out in the swells of the Atlantic Ocean, past the off-the-beaten-track isles of little-known Sao Tome, and directly in line with the coast of Gabon, the province of Annobon is hardly what you&#8217;d call easy to get to. It&#8217;s certainly got an interesting character though, with a history of Portuguese and Spanish colonialism, and the creole-flavoured beachside capital of San Antonio de Pale, to explore. Wildlife lovers will also find plenty to shout about, as pods of humpback whales languish in the swells around the island, rare Ojo Blanco birds hum on the cliffs, and baobabs hide lizards in the backcountry. "
Colobus Monkey,"The southernmost and easternmost of the national parks in Equatorial Guinea, Altos de Nsork is set deep in the West African wildernesses of Rio Muni. Established in 2000, the vast reserve encompasses more than 700 square kilometers of land, offering some of the most untouched jungle and highland ecosystems in the region. There aren’t many visitors to this far-flung section of the nation, but those who do come can hike through paths cut out by forest elephants, wonder at the great biodiversity of plants, spy out mandrills and black colobus monkeys in the trees, and even rare buffalo in the woods. "
Monte Temelón Natural Reserve,"Sandwiched between the border with Cameroon and the rising highlands that form the heart of Rio Muni, the Monte Temelón Natural Reserve is one of the more overlooked sections of backcountry that are ripe for exploration in EQ. It&#8217;s best known for its vast array of fauna, which sprawls for more than 1,200 square kilometers in great swathes of greenery. Mist meets the verdant canopies atop the trees, while crocodiles lurk on the muddied banks of the rivers that abound. Others will come to see the rare giant pangolin that&#8217;s endemic here. "
Corisco,"The little speck of Corisco Island can be found patrolling the entrance to Corisco Bay and the estuaries of Rio Muni just a stone&#8217;s throw from the coast of Equatorial Guinea. And while the untrodden beaches and swaying grasses of the sand dunes here are pretty to say the least, it&#8217;s the history and culture that really draw the crowds (even though those crowds are relatively small!). Yep, not only is there a series of crumbling Spanish missions to be found amidst the inland jungles, but there&#8217;s also been evidence of human habitation in these parts since the early Iron Age! "
Cogo,"Encompassed by the vast green wetlands of the Muni River, seemingly endless swathes of wild mangrove and some of West Africa&#8217;s lesser-known birding spots, the peninsular town of Cogo juts out into the Atlantic Ocean on the extreme southern edge of the Equatorial Guinea coast. And while the stretches of unexplored coastline to its north are of interest, it&#8217;s the patchwork of half-ruined Spanish churches and pueblo houses, the cobbled streets and curious European feel of the town that most often comes top of the menu. Linger some days and enjoy the sleepy, Iberian vibes. "
Utonde Beach,"Last but not least comes little Utonde on the Atlantic coast. With easy access to the runways of Bata Airport and long stretches of largely undeveloped white sand along its edge, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that it&#8217;s here where some of Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s most ambitious tourism development projects are taking hold. Mega resorts are planned, with infinity pools and private beachfronts, while there&#8217;s also connections to the sprawling 330 square kilometers of land that is the Rio Campo Reserve, spread out over Fang tribal hamlets and wetlands near the Cameroonian border to the north. "
Asmara,"There are two sides to this capital city. The first things you’ll notice are the lovely walking neighbourhoods, street cafes with delicious Italian coffee, dozens of pastry shops, and a slow pace about town. In short, you’ll feel like you’ve just arrived at a small village somewhere in Italy. But the flip side of this beauty includes some harsh economic conditions like power cuts, deserted streets, and slow business. Despite the two extremes, Asmara is one of the most congenial cities that you’re likely to visit in Africa. You’ll also find the most concentrated collection of Modernist architecture in the world. ost of the historic area has remained untouched since its conception in the 1930’s when Mussolini had his eye on Ethiopia. Combine the history, architecture, friendly locals, and eight months of sunshine each year, and you’ll come to love Asmara easily. "
Massawa,"Massawa, about 100 kilometres from Asmara, couldn’t be any more different from the capital if it tried. It’s so much fun to stroll through the streets and alleys, discovering all the small porticoes, arcades, and whitewashed buildings tucked here and there. Much of the city was destroyed in the war for independence, and restoration is a slow process. The town sits right on the coast and the overall vibe here is rather relaxed. Don’t miss the houses made out of coral or the Ottoman bazaar. "
The Imperial Palace,Overlooking the harbour in Massawa is the Imperial Palace. The original building dated back to the 16th century and was built by a Turk named Osdemir Pasha. The current building was built in the 19th century by Werner Munzinger and was used by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. It was badly damaged during the Struggle for Independence and in its current condition you can still see a reflection of what Massawa looked like just after the war. 
St Mariam Cathedral,"St Mariam Cathedral is an orthodox church in Massawa. This beautiful building includes a lovely mural on the outside of the building that most find incredibly welcoming. Unique to St Mariam is the monument that sits across the street. Dedicated to the Eritrean Struggle for Independence, the monument is made of three large tanks sitting in the exact spot they stopped in the last battle on Massawa in 1990. Now sitting on a sleek black marble slab, members of the church community clean it each morning in loving memory of those who died. "
Senafe,"In the south of Eritrea, just on the edge of the highlands, is Senafe. Inhabited primarily by the Tigrinya and Saho people the town is most well-known for the Metera (or Balaw Kalaw) ruins. The site is about ten hectares and has a number of ruins including a 3rd century obelisk. Other popular sites in town include Enda-Tradqan, a monolithic church and the huge stone outcropping found to the south of town. If you’re feeling adventurous you can ask a local to show you how to climb to the top of the rocks. You’ll be rewarded with a stunning view! "
Dahlak Marine National Park,"Surrounded by water and located in the Dahlak Archipelago is the Dahlak Marine National Park. This is a dense eco-system largely undisturbed by man. You’ll find turtles, dolphins, manta rays and over 300 species of fish. If you’re a diver, this is your Eritrea destination. Underwater volcanoes have made incredible pumice stone formations and the many shipwrecks around the islands make for one of the most incredible diving experiences you’re like to have. Be on the lookout for Dugon dugon – the unique marine mammals believed to be the origin of the mermaid myth. "
Qohaito,"Between Asmara and Senafe is Qohaito, one of the most famous archaeological sites in Eritrea. Here you’ll find the ruins of the Safra’s Dam and King Saba’s palace – dating to the Axumite and pre-Axumite periods. The site was first discovered in the 19th century and excavation began in the 1960’s. Rock art in this area shows us that the area has been inhabited since the 5th century. Close by is Emba Soira, the country’s highest peak. It’s wonderfully inspiring to consider what life was like that long ago as you explore the ruins. "
Filfil,"Here you’ll find what remains of Eritrea’s tropical forest. This once abundant ‘Green Belt’ is home to a lovely variety of mammals and bird species. It’s surprising to come upon this green area in the middle of an otherwise dry landscape. It’s able to thrive from the escarpment linking the lowlands and highlands. The town of Filfil is a land of plantations and together, the town and forest are a protected national forest. It’s one of the most beautiful areas of the country and a must see during your visit. "
Dankalia,"The portion of Dankalia located within Eritrea runs along the coast of the Red Sea for about 500 kilometres. Inland, the area is known as the Danakil depression and is considered to be the hottest place on Earth. It’s also one of the lowest points on Earth’s surface, having sunk over the years to about 400 feet below sea level. The surface is so thin here that lava oozes upward, constantly changing the landscape. The area is dotted with volcanic cones, isolated mountain groups, and deep valleys. The Afar tribe populates this region and part of their subsistence is from salt mining the large flats in the area. This is not an area for the faint of heart. For those adventurers who dare to go, the landscape is fascinating and once in a lifetime. "
Keren,"The third largest city is Keren, capital of the Anseba province. This is a pretty town that’s famous for being a quiet and laid back place. You’ll find colourful markets and plenty of ethnic diversity here. It’s located in a valley formed by some of Eritrea’s highest peaks, including Amba, Itaber, Lalamba, and Ziban Mountains. Be sure to check out the Tigu Egyptian fort, dating to the 19th century, the railway station, Sayed Bakri Mausoleum, the 6th century Debre Sina Monastery famous for the cave dwellings there, and St Maryam Deari Chapel. For total relaxation, take a nap in one of the many baobab trees like the locals do. "
Colchester Castle,"The oldest town, not just in Essex but the entire country, Colchester was the capital of Roman Britain for a time. If this has caught your attention then Colchester Castle should be your first stop. Built in the 11th century the keep here is the largest of any castle, ruined or standing, in all of Britain. There&#8217;s a newly revamped museum inside to bring you up to speed on Colchester&#8217;s rich history, and it&#8217;s always adding new finds from the town&#8217;s Roman excavation sites. The landscaped and well-tended gardens in Castle Park are just the ticket for a few minutes of repose, and Colchester Zoo is up there with the best  and raises money for wildlife conservation projects in South Africa. "
Southend-on-Sea,"Like many English seaside resorts, Southend&#8217;s heyday was in the 50s and 60s before you could get affordable flights abroad. But unlike a lot of its rivals, Southend has evolved and continues to pull in day-trippers from all over the southeast. One of the draws is the pier, which at 2.16 kilometres is the world&#8217;s longest pleasure pier. If a walk to the pierhead seems too much of a trek, take the train, which runs the full length of the structure. Younger kids and teenagers will get the most out of Southend; even more if Adventure Island is in your plans. It&#8217;s next to the pier and is like a large permanent funfair. "
Saffron Walden,"High in the northwest of the county and far from London&#8217;s urban sprawl, Saffron Walden is a cute medieval market town within striking distance of Cambridge. There has been a market here since the 12th century, which sets up on Tuesdays and Saturdays on the square next to the beautiful Guildhall, which is made of wattle and daub over stone arcades. Myddlyton Place and Castle street, lined with colourful half-timbered buildings, are exceedingly pretty too, and the 15th-century St. Mary&#8217;s is Essex&#8217;s largest parish church. You can also step in to a BBC period drama at the majestic 17th-century Audley End House, which has been in the Baybrooke family since the 1700s. "
Maldon,"The oldest town in Essex after Colchester, Maldon&#8217;s earliest years were a constant struggle against the Vikings, who would sail up the Blackwater estuary to raid the town throughout the 10th century. The banks of the Blackwater are a little more sedate today,  and Promenade Park, laid out in Victorian times, is picnic central on sunny days, with tree-lined avenues and lawns by the water. From there you&#8217;ll notice the Thames sailing barges, flat-bottomed boats that once transported all kinds of goods up and down the Blackwater and Thames estuaries. There&#8217;s long been a military presence in east Essex, and near Maldon it&#8217;s endowed the area with two attractions: The Combined Military Services Museum and Slow Maries Airfield, which puts on air shows with First World War planes. "
"Dedham, Cows by the river Stour","On the River Stour and close to the boundary with Suffolk, Dedham is a refined village with links to two prominent British painters. From medieval times to the 1800s Dedham got rich through the wool and textile trades, and the weavers and mill owners built large timber-framed houses and later regal flat-fronted mansions. John Constable painted Dedham&#8217;s mills and its countryside in the early-1800s; the scenery hasn&#8217;t changed much since then, especially on the Stour where cows and sheep graze in the water meadows. The early-20th-century painter Alfred Munnings lived in Dedham for 40 years and his splendid home is now a gallery for his work. "
Harwich Quay,"Stranded on a peninsula at the entrance to the estuaries of the Rivers Stroud and Orwell, Harwich is Britain&#8217;s second-busiest passenger port. Many of the people who arrive in Harwich will just be passing through, but the town has a thrilling maritime legacy that recalls legendary privateers like Sir Francis Drake and Martin Frobisher. The Mayflower was launched from Harwich in 1620, and its captain, Christopher Jones was born in the town. The older part of Harwich is on a grid system plotted in the 1200s, and is protected as a conservation zone for its jumble of cantilevered and flat-fronted houses. The Electric Palace Cinema from 1911 is the oldest unchanged cinema in Britain, and still has its original silent screen. "
Mersea Island,"The most easterly inhabited island in Britain, Mersea isn&#8217;t as remote as that description makes it sound, as it connects with the Essex mainland by road along a causeway. The local economy is oysters-driven, and there&#8217;s a clutch of seafood restaurants at West Mersea that are a hit with day-trippers. The Company Shed is a rough-and-ready BYOB place in an old wooden hut, but has fantastic oysters, lobster and crab. There&#8217;s a vineyard and hop farm on the island and lots of opportunities to ramble and appreciate the open seascapes. "
Waltham Abbey,"The abbey that gives this market town its name has been in use since the 600s, although the current Norman architecture dates to the 1100. It&#8217;s still loaded with history and while the abbey church survived the dissolution in the 16th century the rest of the monastic buildings were demolished. In the grounds you can see an original gatehouse guarding a bridge, and the abbey is also the resting pace of King Harold, killed in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The problem is that nobody is too sure where he&#8217;s buried! For three centuries gunpowder for the army was manufactured in Waltham Abbey, and at the Royal Gunpowder Mills there&#8217;s a presentation of weapons going back to the 1500s and lots of interactive displays to keep kids engaged. "
Thaxted,"The village of Thaxted, a few minutes from Saffron Walden will win you over as soon as you see the painted houses on Town Street. These are in pastel shades, and it&#8217;s interesting to see how some of the older ones with telltale cantilevered upper floors had been given a classical makeover in the 1700s. The view up the street of the arcaded Guildhall and the buttressed stone spire of St. John&#8217;s Church in the background is special. Equally winsome is John Webb&#8217;s Windmill, and it&#8217;s here for you just on the edge of the village if you ever wanted to see the mechanism of one of these building. "
Epping Forest,"Despite being outside the M25, Epping is the eastern terminus for London Underground&#8217;s Central Line. So while it&#8217;s integrated into the city&#8217;s transport system Epping has the appearance of a rural market town, with a massive forest and farmland backing onto it. The high street is within a conservation area and has rows of beautiful listed houses, including a string of terraced cottages from the 1600s. Epping Forest is 1728 hectares of woodland and heath, and has historical flourishes like Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s Hunting Lodge, which was actually built for her father, the hunting fanatic Henry VIII in 1543. "
Clacton-on-Sea,"There&#8217;s also a familiar old-time vibe about Clacton, as you&#8217;ll tell from the Princes and West Cliff Theatres, great for broad, family entertainment. As with Southend it&#8217;s the kids who will adore this seaside getaway, running wild at the pleasure pier or splashing around on West Beach or the Blue Flag Martello Bay. Holidaymakers pack the seafront for the Clacton Airshow in August, with jets flying in formation and there&#8217;s a fireworks display in the evening to end the day with a bang. The Jaywick Martello Tower is one of a long sequence of early 18th-century watchtowers to spot a possible invasion attempt by Napoleon, and has been repurposed as an arts and cultural centre. "
Colne Valley Railway,"The district of Braintree is composed of four different market towns, all with their own quirks and character, as well as National Trust estates and green countryside. From the late medieval times this region prospered with the help of the woollen textile trade, which explains the profusion of elegant old properties. Everyone from kids to industrial historians will be mad about the diesel and steam locomotives on the Colne Valley Railway, and the Warner Textile Archive documents two centuries of textile manufacturing history and is the second largest of its kind in the UK, though opening times are restricted. Last but not least, Cressing Temple has three 12th-century barns belonging to the Knights Templar, one of which is the oldest surviving timber-framed barn in the world. "
Coggeshall,"One of the delightful market downs within Braintree is Coggeshall, with almost 200 listed buildings in its old centre. When the town&#8217;s textile industry subsided at the start of the 20th century the railway line was redirected, which left a town in suspended animation. Bad news for Coggeshall back then is great news for visitors today as there are creaking timber houses and idiosyncratic landmarks to be found. One is the 15th-century St. Peter ad Vincula Church, which is known as an &#8220;oversized church&#8221; because it was built unnecessarily large by local merchants hoping their generosity would get them into heaven. The Tudor Paycocke&#8217;s House&#8217;s from 1505 is more evidence of the local wealth, and has the most delicate carvings on its painted timbers. "
Chelmsford Cathedral,"The only city in the whole of Essex, Chelmsford , like many places within reasonable reach of London has many commuters. But there&#8217;s also plenty for family days out, and if you&#8217;re coming in the other direction from London you can get here in half an hour. For something sophisticated step into the neoclassical 19th-century villa, Hylands House and take a turn in its 230-hectare grounds, with wide open fields, dotted with ancient oaks and individual little flower gardens. Maybe a bit more child-friendly is the Tropical Wings Zoo, billed as an &#8220;interactive zoo&#8221; that lets you groom a goat, feed a wallaby or hold all kinds of creepy-crawlies. "
Thurrock,"If you&#8217;ve read Conrad&#8217;s Heart of Darkness you&#8217;ll recognise this inhospitable and muddy stretch of the Thames Estuary as the place where the &#8220;Nellie&#8221; is anchored at the start of the book. The waterside is still awaiting redevelopment, but there are interesting things if you know where to look: Tiblury Fort is a star-shaped artillery installation that is operated by English Heritage and fulfilled its defensive purpose right up to the Second World War. Intu Lakeside meanwhile is one of Britain&#8217;s largest shopping centres, with more than 250 stores. "
Tallinn,"The mighty rises of Toompea Hill are what define Estonia’s magnificent capital; soaring in a curious medley of Orthodox onion domes and medieval bulwarks right in the heart of the town. Below this sprawls one chocolate box of a walled city, where stony streets and shadowy alleyways open up onto an enthralling market square and curiously-named keeps like ‘Fat Margaret’ soar above the crenulated fortifications. Given the UNESCO tag, the glorious array of historical monuments and the buzzing collection of shops, beer halls and Estonian eateries, it’s hardly surprising that this one’s on the up as one of Europe’s most coveted capitals. And that’s not even mentioning the bohemian streets of Kalamaja, or the palaces and parks of the Kadriorg district! "
Parnu,"Nestled neatly on the edge of its very own little coastal inlet on the Gulf of Riga, Parnu comes complete with one of the Baltic’s best stretches of pearly-white sand. It’s backed by the all-new and indelibly lively Beach Promenade, where babbling fountains abut al fresco restaurants and the courses of a truly excellent bike track. And in the centre of the town itself, the remnants of an Art Deco boom in the 20s add a real dash of class to the resort, spas rise unexpectedly on the street corners, Ruutli Street beats to a night time tune, and charming timber villas dot the outskirts. In short: this one’s every inch Estonia’s summertime capital! "
Otepaa,"In the warmer months of the year, Otepaa draws in modest crowds of hikers and mountain bikers to the winding trails of Valga County, for strolling through the thick fir forests and walking around the banks of Puhajarve Lake. However, it’s when the snows come that this self-proclaimed winter capital of Estonia really hits its stride. Nordic ski tracks delve deep into the woods, the ski jumps roar with local cheers and the various downhill alpine runs offer a smattering of beginner and intermediate pistes. Aside from the outdoors action, Otepaa also boasts one gorgeous church spire and the crumbling remains of an aged citadel for the history buffs. "
Soomaa National Park,"The flooded forests and mystical bayous of the Soomaa National Park represent unquestionably one of the most beautiful and enchanting destinations in all of Estonia. All-in-all the site encompasses a whopping 359 square kilometers of undulating dunes and low-lying peat bogs, which oscillate between ochre-brown, verdant green and ice-caked white with the changing of the seasons. Unsurprisingly, ecotourism has boomed here in recent years, and today outdoorsy travelers and intrepid types flock here to hit the water capillaries of the Raudna River and Parnu Basin on canoes and kayaks, or to hike the alluvial meadows in the company of cranes and crooked wooden farmhouses. "
Saaremaa Island,"Much-vaunted Saaremaa Island is right up there with Tallinn; an impossibly wonderful landscape of washed-out timber windmills and breezy meadows, sprawling spruce forests and gorgeous coastal stretches scented with juniper and Baltic salt. Walkers and outdoorsy types will love getting lost in the orchid-peppered reaches of Loode, wandering between the mysterious Kaali meteorite craters, beautiful Bear Lake and the hot springs of Puhatu, or bracing the sea winds at the sacred Panga clifftops. The local Saaremaa folk add a dash of nuance to the land too, boasting their own folklore and curious traditions, deeply ironic sense of humour and high-quality vodka to boot! "
Narva,"Straddling the border with Russia in the deep eastern recesses of Estonia, Narva has an altogether different character than the other major urban areas in this Baltic land. For one, the locals overwhelmingly speak Russian, and the character tends to lean eastwards to Moscow rather than westwards to Tallinn and the EU. Hermann Castle is the jewel in the Narva crown, standing tall and proud in whitewashed keeps and stony bulwarks above the city, while the brutalist reconstructed centre offers an interesting taste of the indelible Soviet influence. And then there’s the nearby resort strips of Narva-Joesuu, which come complete with the longest beach in the country and some acclaimed spas to boot. "
Matsalu National Park,"A truly beautiful patchwork of riparian wetlands, reed grass plains and blooming flood meadows on the courses of the Kasari River Delta, the Matsalu National Park is a veritable wonderland for nature lovers and wildlife seekers making their way through Estonia. The 400-square-kilometer park’s birds are particularly famous, coming complete with endangered species like the white-tailed eagle, colossal flocks of barnacle geese, tufted ducks and the single largest migrating amount of cranes on the continent (which can be seen stopping by here in Autumn). Wild horses can also be spotted grazing amidst the wetlands, roaming between the timber fishing huts and the tracks of the Suitsu hiking trail. "
Hiiumaa Island,"A lesson in all things rural Estonia, Hiiumaa is the second largest island in the country, found rising in a medley of windswept coves and coastal fir forests from the Baltic Sea and connected by Europe’s longest ice road to the mainland by winter. Travelers heading here often make a beeline straight for the coast, which comes virtually completed secluded and peppered with historic lighthouses like the stone-clad Kopu Lighthouse – one of the oldest on the planet. Meanwhile, in the island’s inland reaches, crooked timber farmhouses and creaking mills meet dense beech forests at the Suuremoisa Park and smoked plaice fillets issue their enticing aromas from the earthy tavernas. "
Tartu,"Tartu may officially be Estonia’s second city, but the locals prefer to see themselves more as joint first. Fiercely independent from the much larger capital in the north, this southern stronghold of students and Russian speakers is known for its intellectual accomplishments above all else. It has the most prestigious university in Estonia, which rises in a series of neoclassical columns right in the midst of the town. Nearby stands the leafy reaches of Toomemagi; the historic citadel of the city where now the ruined nave of Tartu Cathedral exudes a haunting historicity. Tartu also pulses with youthful energy thanks to its many lecture halls, and al fresco beer bars and underground clubs claim the summertime nights. "
"Witches Well, Tuhala","Traces of human habitation dating back more than three millennia have helped to make Tuhala one of Estonia’s major historic sites; a place offering a glimpse at the centuries before Tallinn’s great medieval bulwarks were even raised. Yes sir, this earthy region is home to mysterious collections of cult stones and ancient religious statues, curious cup-marked carvings and sacred sites oozing pre-Christian traditions. There are also aged timber roads dating from the fourth century, and – of course – the legendary Witch’s Well &#8211; a unique phenomenon that occurs when the subterranean channels of the region’s karst system bubble up and overflow from a rustic well into the surrounding farmlands. "
Kuressaare,"The pretty, castle-topped town of Kuressaare makes its home on the Estonian (as opposed to the Finnish) edge of Saaremaa Island, where it hails in as the westernmost city in the country. Given the unique geography, it’s hardly surprising that this one oozes Germanic and Swedish influences, going from the Teutonic bulwarks of the mighty citadel to the elegant Baroque traces decorating the municipal buildings on Keskvaljak Square. Kuressaare is also famed for its coastal spas, which extoll the healing virtues of the seaside mud and silt deposits and helped to make the city a favourite with naturalist and ecotourists over the years. "
Church in Viljandi,"A boomtown of the Hanseatic League, Viljandi once boasted one of the largest merchant town fortifications in the entire Baltic region. Its raison d&#8217;être? To secure the popular trading routes between the heartlands of Prussia in the west and Russia in the east. Today, and the citadel that once made Viljandi so strong stands ruined atop the town, surrounded by the blooming green spaces that line Lake Viljandi; groves of birch and oak, parks dotted with pine and the pretty timber houses that hide amidst the tree-lined streets. This is the perfect backdrop for Viljandi’s many summertime festivals, which range from nostalgic medieval fayres to open-air theatre productions and ad hoc public art displays. "
Lahemaa National Park,"A whopping 725 square kilometers make up the wild, pine-studded hinterlands of the Lahemaa National Park, making this one of the largest protected natural areas in all of Europe. Sandwiched between the salty rollers of the Baltic and the highways that run eastwards out of Tallinn, the area is eminently accessible for travelers based in the capital, and offers a fine antithesis to city life. There are rolling peat bogs to explore, winding boardwalks, dense thickets of spruce and beech trees, the primeval Oandu Forest (the stomping ground of lynxes and wolf packs) and the majestic Hauaneeme Bay, which can be found glowing pink and mirror-like against the Estonian sunset in the evening. "
Haapsalu,"Hailed by some as the Venice of the Baltics and trodden by the mighty Romanovs during Russia’s imperial age, Haapsalu was raised to prominence under the patronage of the tsars, who came to exploit the curative and medicinal powers of its coastal mud spas. Today and this tradition of bathing is still very much alive, while other visitors will come to stroll down the seaside promenades as the sun sets over the Finnish Gulf, weave between the elegant timber architecture, gawp at the haunted turrets and bulwarks of Haapsalu Castle, enjoy one of Estonia’s most acclaimed blues and jazz festivals in summer, or purchase some of the famous handwoven Haapsalu shawls. "
Lake Peipus,"Straddling the border with Russia in the depths of Southern Estonia, Lake Peipus (the fourth largest lake in all of Europe no less) remains one of the country’s least-trodden and explored areas. It’s famed for the traditional way of life that continues to tick over around its western shores. Here, strings of pretty, timber-clad villages like Varnja and Kallaste abut empty lakeside coves at Nina and Lahe. These come interspersed with the occasional sprawling estate, and enfolded in great swathes of onion fields, while ad hoc farmer’s markets abound and the mysterious churches and religious traditions of Estonia’s so-called Old Believers still stand firm. "
Danakil Depression,"Positioned on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the Danakil Depression. It’s officially one of driest and hottest places on Earth. With temperatures that often reach 50+ degrees, it’s easy to see why.  This is a surreal piece of real estate that’s strewn with active volcanoes, salted basins, hot springs, and a lava lake – all of which combine to create a very lunar-like landscape. Sitting below sea level, it’s the lowest point in Africa and second in the world (after the Dead Sea). Do a bit of planning before you go as the climate can be harsh if you aren’t prepared.  But the beauty and mystery of this place make any preparation well worth it. "
Lalibela,"Lalibela pretty much blows the mind of everyone who visits.  This medieval settlement was designed to be a kind of second Jerusalem and modern day inhabitants remain proud of this distinction. Lalibela is perched in the middle of a broad church complex made entire of rock. There are 11 churches in the settlement, monolithic and grand, all built by King Lalibela as early as the 12th century. Remarkable because of the architectural design, the churches are actually dug into the ground. The most famous, and most beautiful, is St George’s Cathedral.  An awe-inspiring sight. If you’re so inclined, there are several monasteries in the nearby area that are worth visiting. "
Harar,"This holy, historic and walled city is a mesmerizing web of narrow alleyways. Built in the early 16th century, it’s the oldest Islamic city in Africa. It was once the commercial link between Africa and the middle east and today is an enchanting lost-in-time city that’s famous for the impressive walls and centuries old buildings. There are roughly 99 mosques within the city.  A popular attraction is the nightly ritual of feeding they hyenas which happens on the outskirts of the city. It’s been taking place for generations and you can participate if you’re feeling adventurous. "
Babile Elephant Sanctuary,"Only about 1,000 elephants remain in Ethiopia, and by far the largest and most visible herd lives in the Babile Elephant Sanctuary. A short drive from Harar, Babile is also home to gazelles, lions, leopards, cheetahs, and tons of exotic birds. The landscape morphs from rocky outcrops to lovely tree dotted landscapes. Roughly 400 elephants live here and you’ll really love the walking safaris that run each day. "
The Rift Valley,"The Rift Valley is a chain of seven lakes – each with its own distinct feel.  The passage includes wonderful lakes, hot springs, and lots of fun wildlife. If you’ve come to Africa for the wildlife, you’ll love the Rift Valley.  Tourists and locals love to spend time near the hot springs for its therapeutic benefits and because it’s a fabulous way to relax. It makes for a nice road trip to travel the entire length of the valley. "
The Blue Nile Falls,"The Nile River is the longest in Africa and its two tributaries are the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia and along its course you’ll find the   Blue Nile Falls &#8211; a spot to rival Niagara. About 90 minutes from Bahar Dar the scenery here is truly breath-taking. Locally known as Tis Abbay, or ‘great smoke,’ the falls are about 45 metres high during the rainy season. Just downstream from the falls you’ll find Ethiopia’s first stone bridge, built in the 17th century. "
The Omo Valley,"This is a wonderfully unique look into the tribal people of Ethiopia.  Similar to the Maasai in Kenya, the villages in the Lower Omo Valley haven’t been influenced by the outside world. Here you’ll interact with people whose culture is dramatically different from your own. Visit Daasanach village, try not to stare at the Mursi’s unbelievable lip-plates, or view the jumping of the bull’s ceremony with the Hammer. The region itself is a lovely open savannah leading up to forests in the hills. And if you’re interested, you can also try an African safari while you’re here. "
Gondar,"The 18th century of Ethiopia was Gondar, where then Emperor Fasiladas built his fairy tale castles. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is now a wonderful museum complex that showcases the last centuries of the country’s emperors. Lying in a bowl of hills, the Camelot of Africa is a magnificent sight. The wealth and splendor of this ancient capital can still be seen in the modern city. Despite its size Gondar is extremely walkable – start from the Italian piazza in the city centre and enjoy a stroll through tin-roofed stone buildings. Great shopping, restaurants, and hotels are all available here. In nearby Gorgora you’ll find a small but impressive Christian monastery. "
Aksum,"Aksum is a land steeped in folklore.  Believed to have been the home of the Queen of Sheba and the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant, this is one of the oldest cities in all of Africa. Look over the walls of the St Mary of Zion Church Complex where the Ark is supposedly kept and visit the Northern Stelea Field to see the ancient Aksumite Obelisks. Despite the incredible history here, because it’s a small town, Aksum is often overlooked by tourists. Enjoy discovering the relics throughout the city, visit mountaintop monasteries, and go underground to view Aksumite empire tombs. Don’t forget to check out Mai Shum, a large rock hewn reservoir that local tribes believe the Queen of Sheba used as her bath. "
Addis Ababa,"Though Addis Ababa is a large city complete with traffic and urban sprawl, cars still have to make way for shepherds herding their flocks across the road. Many call it the capital of Africa because the African Union is headquartered here (all but one of Africa’s 57 countries belong to the AU). Addis Ababa has the largest market in Africa, incredible cathedrals, churches, and mosques, and the museum that is home to Lucy, the oldest known humanoid in the world. For the surrounding locals, the city is a magical place whose streets are paved with gold, for visitors, it’s the perfect blend of traditional and modern Ethiopia. "
Simien Mountains,"The Simien Mountain range is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site and is rightfully known as God’s playground. A trek alone the escarpment provides one of the most phenomenal vistas in the country. You’re also guaranteed to run in to a group of the Gelada bleeding heart baboons. Inside the Simien National park are a wide variety of wildlife like the Walia ibex, a goat found nowhere else on Earth. "
Bahar Dar,"The third largest city and first stop on the historic circuit in Ethiopia is Bahar Dar. The vibe in the town is relaxed and the nearby lake and monasteries only add to this. If you haven’t spent time lounging by the lake, then you haven’t had the real Bahar Dar experience. You’ll marvel at the tankwa canoe, a seemingly flimsy vessels made out of woven papyrus which are absolutely unsinkable.  They can handle men and ox! "
Lake Ziway,"The Rift Valley stretches from the Red Sea to Mozambique. It’s an incredible piece of real estate and millions of years from now the rifting process, that is ongoing, will entirely split the African continent in two. It’s one of the few geographic features that’s visible from space! It’s an incredible route to travel overland, heading southeast from Addis Ababa, through Mojo, Lake Ziway, Awahs National Park, and beyond. There are a total of five lakes along the route, each with their own unique look and feel. "
Lake Chamo,"If you’re imagining a lively bazaar filled with crocodile products made for tourists, you couldn’t be more wrong. Nothing is for sale and the crocs are alive and well at Lake Chamo.  Take an afternoon or early evening boat ride on the lake where you’ll get an up close and personal view of these massive and magnificent creatures. You’ll be surprised to see entire banks along the lake covered with huge Nile crocodiles – some reaching over six metres long. "
Arba Minch,"Named after the Amharic word for ‘forty springs,’ Arba Minch is an area of many tiny springs that bubble up from the ridge below them. It’s a lovely 3k walk through Nechisar National Park to reach the springs. If you use this area as a stop on the southern Ethiopian circuit, you won’t be disappointed. "
Tampere,"A cocktail of industry and innovation, Finnish hospitality and the vibrant arts, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-tampere-finland/"">Tampere</a> can be found sandwiched between the two colossal lakes of Pyhajarvi and Nasijarvi – both of which offer endless opportunities for boat cruising, hiking and cross-country skiing by winter. Back in the city and the old red-brick mill houses of yesteryear now play host to off-beat exhibitions like the Hiekka Art Museum and the Lenin exhibit, while the Moominvalley Museum and the Amuri open-air park offer glimpses of Finland’s famous Tove Jansson and the nation’s labour history alike. The middle of town is cut-through by the roaring Tammerkoski Rapids, with nearby Keskustori Square and the strip of Hameenkatu buzzing with tea houses, heavy metal dives and black blood sausage holes-in-the-wall. "
Porvoo,"A city of more than 600 years of history, Porvoo hails in as one of Finland’s few bona fide medieval settlements. It can be found clinging to the pretty topography of the Baltic Coast just a short jaunt east out of Helsinki; a patchwork of crooked timber homes painted in red and orange and historically-rich town squares clad in cobble, all fringed by the Middle Age constructions of the town’s onetime Swedish masters. Right at the heart of the centre, the gorgeous Porvoo Cathedral and its half-wood façade ooze with tales of Russian and Danish invaders alike, while locals gather in the marketplace of Old Porvoo to sip coffees and people watch the day away. "
Aurora Borealis above cottages in Lapland,"Ranging from the snow-caked forests of Riisitunturi to the stark and windswept fells of the north, the icy rollers of the Gulf of Bothnia to the blasted boreal tundra of the Arctic Circle, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-lapland-finland/"">Lapland</a> is every inch the mysterious, untapped, untrodden wilderness you’d expect. Travelers flock here to man the husky sleds and delve into the wild forests that encompass ice-crusted Lake Inari, they come to sample hearty reindeer steaks and cloudberry preserves, to see Santa Claus in his ancestral home, to ski the treeless hills, encounter the earthy Sami peoples and their charming town steads, hike the rugged borderlands with Sweden and see ancient timber churches dotting the northern wilds. "
"Karjasilta, Oulu","Facing Sweden on the northern gulf, Oulu is a charming town of islets and bridges, prosperous neighbourhoods and prestigious universities. Indelibly green and verdant in the summer, the banks of the brackish River Oulujoki delineate the town centre, carving it up into a series of pretty cays as the tendrils of the delta move outwards to meet the salty rollers of Bothnia. It’s here that travelers will find the lively cobbles of the central Kauppatori square, packed with farmer’s markets on the weekend, and the bubbling main drag of Rotuaari, with its looming department stores and clutch of student cafes and bars. This all comes peppered with the pretty neo-Renaissance facades of the City Hall and one cutting-edge science centre to boot. "
Helsinki,"The beating cultural, economic and political hub of Finland as a whole, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-helsinki-finland/"">Helsinki</a> is unquestionably one of the most bucket-list capitals in Scandinavia. It bursts forth from its location on the edge of Uusimaa; the Baltic lapping up against its countless inlets and harbours; its resplendent gold-gilded and whitewashed architectural rises belying Petersburg and one seriously ambitious tsarist rebuilding from two centuries ago. But this neoclassical shell and the likes of the gorgeous Lutheran Cathedral are just part of the story. Helsinki’s locals are innovative and edgy in the extreme, offering oodles of design studios and hipster cafes, mind-boggling avant-garde at the Ateneum, otherworldly architectural pieces like the Kiasma and a sophisticated nightlife scene besides. "
Archipelago National Park,"A series of countless islets, cays, sandbanks, protruding coastal rocks and fragmented lands that juts its way out into the cold Baltic on the extreme south-western edge of Finland, the beautiful Archipelago National Park remains one of the nation’s undisputed gems. Some of the islands here are tiny, offering just a mound or craggy salt-washed top to visitors passing by on chugging sightseeing boats. Others, like the Oro Fortress Island, which allows glimpses of Finland’s militarised past during the years of Russian occupation, or Jurmo, showcasing the real rustic beauty of this windswept coastal clime, come packed to the brim with culture and character. "
Turku,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-turku-finland/"">Turku</a> enjoyed several centuries as the most strategic and vibrant town in all of Finland; a medieval boom that’s now showcased in the great wealth of historical monuments here, from the great bulwarks and shadowy dungeons of the Turku Castle to the square-cut tower of the mighty Turku Cathedral. There’s also a vibrant student scene to enjoy, and oodles of al fresco pubs and beer dives, vodka bars and heavy metal music joints. Add to that a truly gorgeous setting on the edge of the Archipelago National Park, the craft exhibitions and untouched historical wonders of the Luostarinmaki district and the pretty beech forests and golf courses of Ruissalo, and Turku really starts to score points! "
Koli National Park,"Hugging the hilly banks of Lake Pielinen as it scars its way through the heartlands of south-central Finland and North Karelia, the Koli National Park is home to truly breathtaking vistas of primeval spruce forests and waterside fir groves. It’s hardly surprising that the area has been the muse for painters and romantics, and there’s little question that its glorious backcountry charms make it the popular hiking and winter sports (there are two ski resorts here) destination it is today. However, Koli is perhaps best seen as a cultural hotspot, famed for its earthy bucolic side and ancient traditions of slash-and-burn farming and rustic agriculture. These are best viewed from vantage points at Ukko-Koli Hill and Vesivaara. "
Seurasaari,"Encompassed by the Baltic waters just a little to the west of Helsinki, the verdant and calm island of Seurasaari represents arguably the most acclaimed open-air museum in Europe. Awash with faded timber barns and painted manors decorated in wooden carvings, bobbing rowing boats and rustic shelters, it does well to showcase the traditional Finnish way of life. But Seurasaari isn’t just about the heritage park that’s made it famous. No sir, there are also secluded beaches here (one’s nudist!) and enchanting moss-clad cabins to discover in the woods, while midsummer sees an eruption of bonfires all around the island – a testimony to the continuation of age old traditions here. "
Hame Castle,"Sleepy Hameenlinna can be found set between the waters and inland wilds of Tavastia in southern Finland; a place off-the-beaten-track and dressed in swathes of green coniferous forest. The town is crowned at the centre by one seriously glorious Swedish castle, which was raised here in the 1200s to secure trading routes back to the Bothnia Gulf. Today and this monolith fortification still silhouettes the horizon of the city, while the home of Sibelius the composer and the Hameenlinna Historical Museum offer a glimpse at the other culture and heritage that has blossomed here since the 16th century. "
Vaasa,"Vaasa is a proud relic of the lengthy Swedish excursion into this western edge of Finland, and a town that fuses its deep history with a lively university scene and modern edge. In the downtown, travelers will discover national monuments (particularly relevant in this town where the tumult of Russian invasions was felt much more than anywhere else), alongside reinvigorated mill houses where lecture halls now talk technology and innovation. The beautiful Market Square is the beating heart of life in Vaasa, while the waterfront walkways and Gothic Revivalism of the stoic maritime buildings there add weight to this one’s age-old connection with the sea. "
Kuopio,"One of the jewels of the Finnish lake district of Northern Savonia, Kuopio sits nestled between the mirror-like waters of Kallavesi and sweeping swathes of spruce forests that flit between icy white and spinach green with the changing of the seasons. A real favorite with adventure tourists and outdoorsy types, the modest little town and its National Romantic architecture, bulbous City Hall and sprawling central square is a fine place to wax up the walking boots and hit the pretty trails of Laivonsaari island, don the Nordic skis and delve into some of the best cross-country routes in Finland, or simply stroll the countryside between creaking windmills and pretty farmsteads. "
Lemmenjoki National Park,"Something like Europe’s answer to the wildernesses of Alaska and Canada, Lemmenjoki National Park sprawls out over a whopping 2,850 square kilometers on the northern fringes of Finland, where the rugged fells give way to the ice fields and chiselled fjords of Norway. The whole area is crisscrossed with over 60 kilometers of marked and maintained hiking trails, drawing thousands of backpackers and walkers each year to the vast hinterland of cascading spruce forests and looming pines, shimmering lakes that turn to ice by winter and the reindeer-dotted woodlands of the high north. Other travelers will come to seek out the gold-digging locals, or the indigenous ancestral homeland of the Sami people, whose rustic timber villages ooze the traditions of a time gone by. "
Levi,"Mantled in snow for its long, long winters, and perched neatly up between the rugged, tree-dotted fells of the Arctic Circle, Levi hails in as Finland’s top winter resort. Skiers come by their droves to enjoy the generous powder and guaranteed conditions, which spread out over the 43 alpine runs and offer a whole host of skiing and boarding for beginners through to intermediates (there are also a handful of challenging black runs). In the evening the charming town takes over, its pine-clad sauna spas and reindeer farms all lit up by the Northern Lights – pure winter bliss! "
"Mariehamn, Aland Islands","A stepping stone of an archipelago at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia, the Swedephone Aland Islands are a real curiosity to say the least. The locals speak Swedish and proudly talk of their duty-free, tax-free rights to the mainland Finns who make their way here in the summer. They also tout their own brand of Aland pancakes (to-die-for!) and an enthralling mix of Russian fortresses and mysterious castle ruins left over by the Swedish kings (check Kastelholm). The real treat here, however, is the backcountry, which rises from the Baltic Sea in a medley of shimmering, ivory-white beaches, rocky shores peppered with shaggy sheep herds, winding seaside bridges and verdant spruce groves.

Eiffel Tower,"The legendary City of Love and City of Light, home of the Louvre, towering Montmartre, the Latin Quarter where Hemingway rubbed shoulders with Ginsberg, the winding Seine, Notre Dame and the iconic silhouette of the Eifel Tower, Paris is a city that surely needs no introduction. For travelers heading to France for the first time, it’s likely that this sprawling and mythic capital will be on the menu. Rarely does it disappoint. No sir, not with all those aromatic wine bars, elegant Versailles, the prestigious Arc de Triomphe, uber-luxurious Champs-Elysees, the haunting sepulchres of Pere Lachaise (Jim Morrison et al), the totemic buildings of the Ile de la Cite, the al fresco coffee joints along St-Martin – the list goes on. And on! "
Porquerolles,"Sparkling like a pearl betwixt the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the bowl-shaped island of Porquerolles remains one of the lesser-known jewels of the Cote d&#8217;Azur. Cars cannot cross over from the mainland, and there are no tarmacked roads to be found, meaning transport between the various secluded coves and rocky inlets, arches of ivory-white sand and charming port towns is left solely to clicking bicycles. These rumble over rocky tracks and through blooming sunflower fields around the centre of the island, allowing travelers to glimpse the woods of Spanish fir and the swaying coastal pines, smell the eucalyptus and myrtle and enjoy pure seclusion as they flit between the various postcard beaches that abound. "
Marseille,"The grand old dame of Marseille comes filled with confidence, history and panache. It’s considered one of the oldest cities in all of Europe, was shaped by the Greeks, the Romans, Anjou Dukes, Provencal nobility and the French imperialists alike, played hosts to Dumas’ famous Count of Monte Christo and now rises as the second-largest metropolis in all of France. It bursts dramatically out from the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, beset by rugged calanque cliffs and home to arguably the most iconic port district on the continent: Vieux Port. This is the beating, earthy middle of the town, which sits watched over by the Byzantine faces of the Notre Dame de la Garde on the hill, hosts countless maritime museums and abuts the beautiful Le Panier neighbourhood – the oldest and most enthralling in the city. "
Lyon,"There are few cities in Europe more historically imbued than old Lyon. Tagged by UNESCO and bursting at the seams with everything from Roman amphitheatres to Renaissance palazzos, this one is unquestionably one of France’s must-see metropolises. Travelers should begin with a jaunt through Vieux Lyon, clustering on the Saone in a glorious display of 15th and 16th century builds: the beautiful Traboules; the gilded St Jean Cathedral. High above rises Fourviere hill, its colossal Christian buildings displaying a wealth of Gothic and Byzantine art, while Presqu&#8217;ile throbs with coffee shops, high-fashion boutiques and opera houses in the middle of the dual river ways. Meanwhile, Roman relics abound in Croix-Rousse, and monuments to the city’s much-loved Lumieres pepper the street corners all around. "
Strasbourg,"Well-to-do Strasbourg may not seem French at first glance, with its Germanic homes and Rhineland-style half-timbered buildings from centuries gone by. But this richly-endowed city on the very cusp of Alsace makes for a curious mixture of cultures like no other in the country, booming with Gewurtztraminer and Reisling wines, Kronenbourg brews, choucroute cabbage platters and more handsome Alsatian streets than you can shake a flammekuche pizza bread at. Tourists tend to flock to the impossibly pretty Petite France district, where winding cobbled lanes meet wood studded townhouses and blooming baskets of rhododendron cascade down the edges of canals. And on the newer side of town, the European Parliament and court rooms showcase this city’s uber-modern and politically important side. "
Gassin,"Set just back from the sparkling waters of the Cote d&#8217;Azur, delightful little Gassin makes its home on the soft hillsides that rise between Saint Tropez and Saint Maxime – the two jet setter enclaves of the French Riviera. Hailed by many as the most beautiful village in the country, its labyrinth of tight-knit streets comes dressed in blooms of bougainvillea, concealing hidden staircases and archways. The homes are clad in ivy and shuttered with Mediterranean-blue windows, while the string of al fresco bistros and cafes that line the central drag offer up sweeping views of La Croix Valmer, the coast and the looming town ramparts – themselves a relic of when the Moors held sway in southern France. "
Diane&#8217;s Garden &amp; Château de Chenonceau,"The beloved Garden of France stretches its way right through the heartlands of the nation for a length of more than 280 kilometers. A land of rolling vineyards and manicured wineries, Sancerre reds and Muscadet whites, it unfolds gloriously from the edges of the winding Loire River. And while the undulating hills and grass-come-sunflower patchwork of the backcountry is truly wonderful to behold and explore (best by bike), it’s the Loire’s human history that has cemented it in the lists of UNESCO. This manifests in glorious Chateaux and hilltop castles, like the Gothic colossus at Amboise – the onetime home of the French kings – and the elaborate medievalism of the Chateau de Chambord to name just two of the many sites. "
Arras,"Off-the-beaten track Arras sits midway between the port town of Calais and the bustling metropolis of Paris. Steeped in history, it draws huge crowds right throughout the year with its palimpsest of historical treats; the result of centuries of ancient and medieval strife that saw Arras flit from Roman control to the Dukes of Flanders, Burgundy, the Spanish Habsburgs and French monarchy. The jewel in the crown is the UNESCO-attested Gothic belfry in the centre of the city, which rises high above the cobbled squares and Flemish apses of the townhouses. Meanwhile, the iconic Boves extend below the city, representing one of the most extensive urban subterranean systems in Europe. "
Beach in Normandy,"The beaches of <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-see-normandy-france/"">Normandy</a> are now synonymous with the tumultuous conflicts of 1944. Today, and travelers making their way to this northern region’s string of chalk-cliff-backed sands and undulating dunes can opt to tour the iconic battlefields that were the main contact point on D-Day, flitting between looming memorials to the fallen on Omaha Beach and the remnants of the gun batteries and cement bunkers of the infamous Atlantic Wall. However, Normandy isn’t consumed entirely by its dark past. No sir, majestic medieval cathedrals stand tall in the English Channel at Mont Saint-Michel, pretty Cistercian abbeys dot the landscapes and the winding Seine offers a walker’s paradise in the south. "
Chamonix,"Set deep in the French Alps, where the chiselled tops and ice-capped summits of mighty Mont Blanc (the highest mountain in Europe outside of the Caucuses) peaks to a formidable 4,800 meters above sea level, Chamonix remains an icon for Alpinists, skiers, boarders and adventure travelers the world over. Host of the first ever Winter Olympics, the resort town now boasts a whopping 760 acres of skiable terrain, along with some of the best off-piste riding in the world (guides are a must!). The town is shrouded by the massif above, and travels can hop the Aiguille du Midi cable car to the top for some of the most breathtaking views in the Alps. Others will linger below, where luxury spa hotels and cafes now abound between the fashion boutiques. "
Corsica,"A teardrop in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Corsica’s cliffs rise like a Greek phalanx against the Mediterranean waves. Rugged and unspoilt, this is a land beset by mountains and cliffs, rolling from ivory-white pebble beaches to the precipitous inland hills. Once a Greek colony, then a part of the Roman Empire and under the medieval hegemony of Italian dynasties, it’s hardly surprising that Corsica has a character apart from the rest of France. Olive groves fill the backcountry, curious Latin-esque folk music issues from the tavernas, Tuscan citadels rise formidably in Bonifacio. Yet for all that, this is still the island that gave the world Napoleon, who was born here in Ajaccio in 1769. "
Lille,"Sprawled out just on the cusp of the Low Countries and the Flemish half of Belgium, Lille fuses several of the cultural strands of northern Europe in one seriously engaging and energetic metropolis. Since the industrial revolution, the town has garnered something of a reputation as one of France’s grimy, working hubs, although that’s now given way to a confident modernism that flows through the Flemish streets of the city centre with panache. Add to that a fine Beaux-Arts museum, a huge crowd of resident students (ergo one hedonistic nightlife scene) and a clutch of Belgian-inspired chocolatiers and waffle stalls, and Lille really is worth the visit! "
Nimes,"A jewel of the Languedoc-Roussillon, Nimes sits sandwiched between the rugged gorges of the Cevennes range and the sparkling beaches of the Med. Immediately visible is the great Roman amphitheatre at the town’s heart – the best preserved in all of France. Below, in the shadow of the great apses of the 1st century megastructure, the colonnades of the Maison Carree continue the Roman theme, while the Pont du Gard on the edge of town is nothing short of a photographer’s dream! Today and this kingpin of erstwhile Gaul buzzes with marketplaces and al fresco cafes, doing well to balance its overtly historic veneer with just a dash of energy courtesy of the French Riviera to the south. "
Carcassonne,"Looking plucked straight from the pages of Game of Thrones, the Tolkien-esque creation of Carcassonne remains unquestionably one of the most magnificent and astounding medieval citadels in all of Europe. It was raised during the Middle Ages, when this pretty Languedoc draw found itself on the frontier between France and the powers of Aragon. Today, it comes with a much-deserved UNESCO tag, and conceals a winding old town between its bulwarks. Known as the La Cite, this is awash with medievalist craft shops and countless stone-clad alleyways and streets. What’s more, the bucolic surrounds of the city are home to some of the best Vins de Pays wineries in France. Just saying! "
Nice,"Enfolded by the summertime beaches of the French Rivera, Nice is much more than just the jet setter town its rows of Ferraris, Porsches and bobbing millionaire yachts make it out to be. For one, its history runs all the way back to the days of pre-Roman Gaul, when the Greeks of Massilia made it one of the biggest trading outposts on the French Med. Later, influences from Savoy gave the place an Italian charm, while English aristocrats in the 1800s imbued the town with the now-legendary Promenade des Anglais; an arc of sun-splashed, palm-shaded promenade that runs the length of its seaside casinos and bars. Vieux Nice is charming to boot, with its medieval homes, while Cimiez means ancient ruins and Roman relics. "
Libreville,"Roughly one third of Gabon’s inhabitants live in Libreville. It stands as the country’s capital and only real city to speak of. Because of an influx of oil money, you’ll find paved roads, clean streets, unbelievable restaurants, surprisingly good French wine, casinos, and gated communities. Not exactly like the Africa of its neighbours. But Libreville’s foundation has a vibrant African heartbeat complete with the overcrowded, chaotic, and oh-so-fun markets, close knit communities, and gorgeous coastline. Founded in the mid 19th century by freed slaves (Libreville means ‘Freetown’ French), the city grew slowly and attracted a wide variety of people – creating a modern day eclectic town. In addition to the markets, don’t forget the National Museum, the Presidential Palace, L’Eglise St-Michel (St Michael Cathedral), and the Musée des Arts et Traditions du Gabon. When you’re ready to relax, find a little spot of beach like Ekwata Island and soak up the sun. "
Loango National Park,"The crown jewel in the 13 national park system is undoubtedly Loango. One of Africa’s best safari experiences is waiting for you here. The park has lush landscape and fantastic wildlife. You’ll find almost 200 kilometres of uninhabited shoreline, making Loango one of the last fully wild coastal areas. The park has forest, lagoons, wetlands, and savannahs. In addition to the famous surfing hippos captured by a National Geographic crew in 2004, you’ll see gorillas, elephants walking along the beach, whales, dolphins, buffalo, and more. This is one of the last places on Earth where these animals have access to the sea. The park has a catch and release fishing program and sport fishermen have been known to hook rouge, barracuda, and even sharks. Most people consider Loango to be the number one safari destination on planet Earth. "
Pongara,"The almost 900 square kilometres of Pongara National Park were select because of the diverse landscape there. Forest, mangrove flats, beach, and savannah. It’s incredibly accessible (for Gabon!) and home to tons of bird species, including the threatened Damara terns. The forests are filled with monkeys, duiker, buffalo, elephants, and chimpanzees. Pongara Point, the beach area of the park where the estuary connects to the ocean, is home to endangered leatherback turtles. This is the place where they crawl ashore in order to lay their eggs. If you’re visit between November and February you can catch one of the many educational programmes conducted by Adventures Without Borders, a group whose aim is to protect the turtles and reduce the threat caused by humans. Don’t miss the first burial spot of Chief Rapontchombo and learn about the mysteries of his second burial spot! "
Fernan Vaz Lagoon Gorilla,"The highlight of the Ogooué maritime region is the Fernan Vaz Lagoon. Named for the Portuguese explorer who found it in the 15th century, the area is engaged in a number of conservation efforts. On Gorilla Island, the Fernan-Vaz Gorilla Project (PGFA) runs a sanctuary and reintroduction centre. There are two gorillas living there now who help to educate visitors on the plight of these magnificent animals. Another eight orphaned gorillas also live there, away from human contact, with the aim of reintroducing them into the wild. Fernan Vaz also has a bit of history to share. In the late 19th century the Mission Saint Anne was built. Designed by Gustav Eiffel himself, the church is a formidable building, worn to a beautiful and distinctive rusty red over the years. Walk the grounds during the day or night for incredible views of the beach and forest. "
Ivindo National Park,"Perhaps the most remote of all the national parks, Ivindo is also one of the most important in all of Central Africa for the work being done for biodiversity conservation. The river is the main feature of the area, running through the rainforest and creating an unbelievable series of rapids and waterfalls. There are adventure packages that will allow you to camp in the rainforest and around the falls as well as enjoy a pirogue lesson and day excursion on the river. Bird lovers will enjoy the 430+ bird species that include African grey parrots. Gorillas, chimps, colobus, mandrill, mangebey, sitatunga, duikers, giant pangolin, bush pig, and more can all be spotted across this 3000 km2 park. Don’t forget to check out Langoué Bai. Bai is the Pygmy word for forest clearing, and this gorgeous stretch of land is rich in mineral water. The elephants keep the area clean by digging to the rich saline soil which then attracts other large mammals to feast there. "
Kongou waterfalls,"Makokou is the capital of the Ogooué-Ivindo region and the gateway to Kongou waterfalls – Gabon’s own version of Niagara Falls. Located inside Ivindo National Park, Kongou is definitely a must see with a 60 metre drop and great spiritual significance to the local people. The village of Makokou is rather isolated but does have air, rail, and river access. Pygmies live in the forest surrounding the village and using the village as a base camp gives you great opportunities to interact with the locals. "
Franceville,"The end of the Trans-Gabon Railway is Franceville, one of the four largest ‘cities’ in Gabon. At one point it was the governments chosen city to resettle former slaves and now is a bustling and lively place with a village atmosphere. Tourists enjoy St. Hilaire’s Church (19th century) and the memorial to former President Omar. The market makes for a fun stroll – be sure to check out the bushmeat, which includes African Rock Python! For nature lovers the Poubara Falls are nearby and make for an excellent nature walk. "
Port-Gentil,"The second largest city after Libreville is Port-Gentil (or Mandji as some of the locals call it).  This seaport town is the hub of the country’s timber and petroleum interests. And given its roots as a customs outpost and base camp for colonial expeditions into the country, it’s easy to see how the town has grown into its current commercial importance. Located on Mandji Island, it isn’t connected to the mainland by road. In addition to being famous for its industry, Port-Gentil is also famous for the nightlife and casino there. During the day, be sure to check out the local zoo and St. Louis Church (20th century). "
Point Denis,"Point Denis is popular primarily because tourism development hasn’t reached there yet. Though it’s a quick boat ride from Libreville, it feels like another world. The beach runs for several kilometres and ends where the Pongara National Park begins. The laid back town has comfortable restaurants, small boutique hotels, and great water sports. On the western side of the island you’ll find only locals and a wilder coast line. It’s a place where you’ll immediately know that you’re near equatorial jungle. If you’re looking for solitude and long introspective walks with gorgeous scenery, Point Denis is your place. "
Réserve de la Lopé,"Smack-dab on the equatorial is Réserve de la Lopé, complete with savannah, rolling hills, and rainforest where it’s possible to see buffalo, elephants, gorillas, and mandrills. This national park was originally a reserve created in the 1940’s after the Okanda Wildlife Reserve was established. It’s now a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’ll find a research station there run by the Zoological Society of London. You can stay at the station and be less than five metres from the rainforest at all times. "
Lastoursville,"Known as Lozo by the locals, Lastoursville is sleepy little town on the banks of the Ogooué River. The town itself is not remarkable, it’s the surrounding area that has all the highlights. First up are nature hikes out to Boundji Waterfalls – beautiful and serene. The biggest attraction is undoubtedly the caves near Lastoursville – just an hours walk from the town centre. They were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.  Recent expeditions have charted over three miles of undiscovered underground cave. "
Lambaréné,"Lambaréné is a town roughly 75 kilometres from the equator in the Central African Rainforest. Made famous by Albert Schweitzer when he built his hospital there in 1913, the town is now home to the Bantu ethnic groups. Primarily a fishing town it’s a great place to relax and experience local life in Gabon. You can tour the hospital and see the remarkable work being done. "
Minkébé National Park,"Travelling to Minkébé is a bit tricky, but well worth the effort. Another of the more inaccessible parks, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is working in the area to promote conservation efforts. Home to gorillas, elephants, leopards, cheetahs, and isolated traditional ethnic groups, WWF focuses attention on alternative forms of income for the locals – including artistic endeavours. The WWF reports that the elephant population here is probably the largest in all of Africa. Several species in the park are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. When you visit you’ll learn about the Kwèl and Kota ethnic groups that life within the park. Find out about the Baka Edzengui, the forest spirit, the Kota mask, and the Kwèl Deke dance. "
Mayumba National Park,"This park lies close to the border of the Republic of Congo and is the only one that is primarily a marine park. It’s a thin strip of land that includes savanna, dunes, beach, and rainforest. About 60km of this strip is protected leatherback turtle nesting beach. There’s a great chance that you’ll spot the barnacled whales, dolphins, sea turtles, leopards, antelopes, crocodiles, hippos, monkeys, and of course, elephants. Locals will tell you that the area is protected by the spirits of the ancestors. "
Akanda National Park,"Internationally known as the nesting ground for one of the largest populations of migratory birds on Earth, Akanda National Park accounts for about 25% of protected mangrove in all of Africa. The Bantu tribe believe that the Mondah forest, within the park, is a sacred place where many of their myths and legends originate. This is also the ideal spot for water sports, fishing, and spotting dolphins and whales. Be sure to check out Leatherback Trove where the Ministry of Water and Forest partner with the Gabon Sea Turtle Partnership in order to train teams to record illegal fishing close to the coast line in order to protect the leatherbacks – whose population has diminished by 90%.

Tusheti National Park,"Cascading down the northern edges of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, right on the cusp of Russia and Chechnya, the Tusheti National Park is the historic home of the eponymous Tush peoples. It’s also breathtaking in the extreme; big on relief and made up largely of soaring peaks and grass-clad hills. There are few roads in sight, and the villages that can be found nestled amidst the misty mountaintops are historic, brick-built affairs like Dartlo, which can be seen protruding almost organically from the Georgian lands, encompassed in rural sheep farms (the region is particularly famous for its wool and cheeses) and swathes of spruce forests to boot. "
Tbilisi,"The great up-and-coming capital of this up-and-coming country, Tbilisi is the nerve centre of Georgia’s drive towards modernity. It’s also a town steeped in history, making it a great place to explore the republic’s fine balance of the old and the new. The city sprawls out along the ridges that bubble about the banks of the Mtkvari River. The district of Old Tbilisi forms its heart; a medley of mysterious Byzantine churches, timber balconies and the occasional piece of striking modern art (check out Sioni Street). Above, draped over the hills, the mighty precipices, cathedral tops and bulwarks of Narikala stand firm, while well-to-do Vake district babbles with public fountains and pretty parks. "
Borjomi,"While Borjomi may still be best known as the source of its namesake mineral water – a salty, uber-frizzante concoction that was beloved by Georgia’s onetime Soviet masters – the city of today has plenty more to offer than just its sulphuric, volcanic springs. For one, the setting is magnificent, with the town plugged neatly between the ridges of the Borjomi Gorge. Then there’s the elegant faces of Russian imperial architecture, painted in pretty yellows an ochres and abutting neatly up to the fountains and grassy lawns of the city park. What’s more, the mysterious Green Monastery lurks just on the edge of town, encompassed by primeval forests and oozing with dark tales of monkish massacres from the Middle Ages. "
Vardzia,"Cut and carved meticulously into the sandy rock faces that rise like phalanxes against the meanders of the Mtkvari River in the deep Georgian south, Vardzia remains without question one of the most dramatic sights to behold in the country. It’s estimated that the various tiers of monolith churches, caves and shrines seen here were inhabited from at least the middle of the 12th century, when the dynatstic kings of the Bagrationi are thought to have commissioned the first constructions on the sheer-cut edge of Mount Erusheti. The real must-see, however, remains the glorious Church of the Dormition; a rock-carved shrine which displays an enthralling montage of murals and iconostasis that fuse Oriental, Byzantine and Romanesque styles alike. "
Mtskheta,"Situated just a short ride out of the capital of Tbilisi, UNESCO-attested Mtskheta clutches the low-lying banks of the Aragvi River confluence. Hailed for its countless Christian sites and importance as one of the nerve centres of the Georgian Orthodox Church, the town draws huge crowds throughout the year. They come to see the beautiful rises and magnificent frescoes of the great Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, which stands as one of the finest examples of medieval Georgian religious architecture and a revered pilgrimage site for Georgians right across the country, or the Jvari Monastery on the hill, soaring high above Mtskheta &#8211; a curious mix of tetraconch architecture, Hellenistic, Byzantine and Georgian styles hidden between its apses. "
Mestia,"Shrouded by the snow-mantled peaks of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, deep in the legendary lands of Svaneti, the various hamlets and dabas (small historic towns) of Mestia rarely fail to draw a gasp. They are instantly recognisable thanks to their stone-clad, square-cut Svan towers, which rise majestically from between the groves of chestnut and birch here, oozing with centuries of Georgian history and culture. Today, this ancient cluster of UNESCO-tagged villages is really on the up, with a new airport bringing new guesthouses and more and more people weaving between the striking architectural pieces of Lekhtagi and Lagami (two of the most attractive small centres). Others come to hit the Chalaadi glacier and hike the trails to massive Mountain Ushba in the distance. "
Gudauri,"Set more than 2,000 meters above the low valleys that carve their way through the heart of the Greater Caucasus range on the edge of northern Georgia, Gudauri has risen and risen in recent years to establish itself as the country’s prime winter sports destination and also a fine alternative to the bustling ski fields of the Alps. Skiers and boarders here enjoy a relatively snow-sure set of pistes that range from 22 kilometers of blue beginner runs to a welcome 10 kilometers of challenging black runs. What’s more, the season runs well into April and new investments mean the lifts are all speedy Doppelmayr ones. The resort is also hailed as one of the world centres for Heliskiing – if that’s your sort of thing! "
Lake Ritsa,"First-time travelers to Georgia could be forgiven for thinking that the shimmering waters of Lake Ritsa, set deep in a valley of the Caucasus Mountains and surrounded by verdant dashes of buxus and Nordman firs, had been plucked straight from the Austrian Alps or the Rockies of British Columbia. But no, this picture-perfect alpine retreat between the mountains of Abkhazia (a separatist section of the country that buts up to the Black Sea in the north-west) really is in Georgia. The lake and the surrounding forests are great for hikers looking to delve into one of the less-trodden natural reaches here, while boating and wild swimming in the icy waters are also favourite pastimes. "
Telavi,"The kingpin of the Georgian east makes its home between the sloping foothills of the Tsiv-Gombori. Boasting a history of more than 2,000 years, Telavi was shaped by the Romans, the Kakheti kings, the Georgian monarchs and the Russian tsars alike. That means a unique array of architectural pieces to discover, going from the formidable bulwarks of the Dzveli Galavani, left over from the region’s dynastic rulers in the 9th century, to the Batonis Tsikhe, a testimony to the late medieval period that blossomed here. Other travelers will wonder at the 45-meter high sycamore tree, whose sinewy 900-year-old trunk really is a sight to behold, and the Alaverdi Monastery, sat between the mountains just on the edge of the town. "
Stepantsminda,"The icy tendrils and muscular ridges of Mount Kazbek dominate the horizon around breathtaking Stepantsminda; a town at once remote and wild that can be found nestled deep between the Caucasus ridges in Mtskheta-Mtianeti. Along the massifs of Kazbek just above the city, it’s possible to spy out the glistening caps of the Kuru and Shino glaciers, two of the natural wonders that have helped to catapult Stepantsminda to the forefront of Georgia’s ecotourist and adventure travel boom. Expect hiking opportunities aplenty, along with a whole host of other adrenaline-pumping pursuits, from hang-gliding over the tips of the great Holy Trinity Church to rafting and rock climbing. "
"Dadiani Palace, Zugdidi","A fine stepping stone for further explorations in Svaneti, the Samegrelo region, the Georgian Black Sea coast and the autonomous region of Abkhazia, Zugdidi is shrouded by the serrated ridges of the Greater Caucasus just south of where the mountains claim the land. A relatively new town (at least as Georgia’s wealth of ancient and medieval centres goes), this regional capital is home to the elegant facades and enthralling architectural exhibitions of the Dadiani Palace, which rises in beautiful crenulations against the flowing waters of the Chkhoushi River right in the heart of the centre. Others will come to seek a spot of adventure in the Martvili Canyon, or hit the famous hot springs that lurk in the hinterlands close to the city. "
Ushguli,"A string of five villages deep in the heart of the majestically beautiful Svaneti region, Ushguli bears its UNESCO tag with pride. Set between fields of cattle and crooked farmsteads more than 2,000 meters above sea level, the site encompasses towns like Zhibiani and Chazhashi, which pepper the grass plains below the shimmering ice of the Shkhara glacier like ancient relics strewn haphazardly amidst the Georgian highlands. The spot is also home one fascinating ethnography museum, and is known as the place where Georgia’s national treasures were hidden away during times of national conflict and strife. "
Sighnaghi,"Dressed like a Tuscan hilltop town above the verdant reaches of the Alazani valley, Sighnaghi really does live up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful towns in the country. A sea of cascading red-tiled roofs are what mark it out against the Caucasus glaciers on the horizon, while winding streets of cobblestone and painted timber bungalows showcase the traditional 19th-century Georgian style that continues to flourish here. Be sure to tour the bulwarks of the crumbling town wall and its 23 towers, wonder at the stupa-like spire of the St Giorgi church and discover the revered pilgrimage sites of the Bodbe Convent. "
Batumi,"Neon lights and bustling seaside promenades, soaring high-rises and the pulse of modernity are what set Batumi of the Black Sea firmly apart from Georgia’s wealth of ancient and medieval towns. But despite its stylish edge, Batumi is actually one of the oldest cities in the country, with roots going back to the age of ancient Greek colonialism. Relics of that long-gone history still do lurk here, at spots like the Gonio-Apsarosi Fortress and between the rooms of the archaeology museum, though only amidst a shiny, steely new dash of condos and industry that’s come with Batumi’s place as the Georgian port city elect. Of course, nightlife is big, coalescing in Georgian wine bars and cafes along the beachside Boulevard. "
Uplistsikhe,"Remote and lonely on the hills of Shida Kartli, Uplistsikhe is thought to have once been one of the major political and economic centres of the Kingdom of Kartli, which dominated the heartlands of the Caucasus around the year zero. Today, and visitors who come here can discover an almost organic protrusion of the beige-brown hills Uplistsikhe is settled on; a series of monolith cave dwellings and winding staircases hewn deep into the rock. Crowning the site is a somewhat anachronistic cathedral complex, which dates from the 10th century (after the Christianisation of Georgia) and commands sweeping views of the eastern plains. "
Berlin,"Cool, sophisticated, cutting-edge and packed to the very tip of its iconic TV tower with culture, history and character, Berlin is one of Europe’s undisputed bucket-list capitals. At its very heart, the famed Museum Island oozes with everything from classical antiquities plucked from Babylon to Troy, while the darker tales of the 20th century can be uncovered at spots like Checkpoint Charlie, the crumbling remnants of the Berlin Wall and the striking Jewish Memorial by Peter Eisenman. Then there’s the boho centre of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, awash with cafes and cool jazz joints, ad hoc craft studios and artsy galleries, all of which is neatly balanced with the straight-laced Reichstag, The Brandenburg Gate and summertime picnics in the Tiergarten. "
Neuschwanstein Castle,"The great Romantic legacy of Bavarian king Ludwig II still stands tall on the precipitous ridges of the German Alps; a testimony to the fairy-tale, ethereal nature of the glacier-topped, craggy landscape in which it sits. Hailed by many as the single most breathtaking castle structure on the planet, Neuschwanstein can be found perched above the small and charming town of Hohenschwangau. Its countless turrets and keeps, flying buttresses and creaking drawbridges make it easy to see why the complex inspired both Walt Disney and J K Rowling, while inside it’s possible to uncover a glimpse of the opulence and extravagance enjoyed by arguably Bavaria’s most famous monarch. "
Munich,"Beer-mad, leather-loving, mountain-shrouded Munich is a fast-paced metropolis deep in the German south. The regional capital of the state of Bavaria, the character and people here are fiercely independent to the rest of Germany. In these climes it’s all about frothy wiessbier brewed to ancient Bavarian recipes, smoky bratwurst and balancing an often troubled (it was here that Hitler attempted the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923) and otherwise rich (Munich enjoyed a golden age during the height of the Bavarian kings) history. The town itself is a medley of the medieval, the gorgeous baroque and green parkland, headed up by the beautiful Englischer Garten, sprawling Marienplatz and the bob-topped domes of the Frauenkirche. Awesome to say the least! "
Dresden,"Razed to oblivion during World War II, Dresden is the great phoenix city of Germany &#8211; but you wouldn’t believe it. No sir, not with that resplendent outline of the Frauenkirche, the impeccable neoclassicism of the Zwinger Palace and the pristine faces of the great Semper Oper adorning the town centre here, all clustering neatly along the meanders of the River Elbe as if they had been untouched for centuries. Indeed, arguably Europe’s most elaborate urban post-war reconstruction project (sorry Warsaw!) has been kind to Dresden, helping to return this once formidable Saxon stronghold to the jewel of the German east it once was. "
Weimar,"Weimar literally bursts with the ghosts of geniuses, such is the lingering intellectual prowess of this city in the central state of Thuringia. Travelers who come will soon find themselves lost between glorious statues of Goethe, effigies of the great philosopher Schiller, rooms where Liszt, Hummel and Bach alike would have practiced and composed, where Nietzsche would have roamed – the list goes on. Spots like the Wiemar Market Square showcase the town’s so-called Golden Age boom that came with so many great minds; rows of 16th and 17th-century mansions and gloriously adorned facades. There are parks too (perfect for flicking through the pages of German philosophers), along with spots relevant to the establishment of the Weimar Republic back in 1918. "
"Oberwesel, Rhineland","A mythic place that clings to the meandering channels of the River Rhine as it carves its way through the West German hills northwards from Lake Constance, this wonderful swathe of deep-cut valleys is home to some of the country’s most breathtaking castles and cultural landscapes. Along its course, travelers can spot out historic towns like Boppard, the legendary rocks of Loreley, two-millennium-old Koblenz and the fairy-tale turret tops of Eltz Castle. However, there’s one thing the Rhineland certainly trumps the rest of Germany in: wine. Yes sir, the cascading vineyards of Riesling and Spatburgunder that flow from the hilltops to the riverbanks of the Mosel and Rhine here represent some of the finest sweet whites and reds in Europe – or so they say! "
Berchtesgaden,"Perched beautifully on the plateaus of the Bavarian mountains, just a stone’s throw from the Austrian border, the peaceful Alpine enclave of Berchtesgaden is a real beauty – even as the invariably irresistible hill towns in these parts go! Carved wooden balconies blooming with bougainvillea cascade over half-timbered homes in the town centre, frescoed facades adorn the central square and the mirror-like waters of the Konigssee shimmer and shine in the distance. Up above the gingerbread-type town is where travelers can spy out Berchtesgaden’s somewhat darker past, between the sturdy corridors of the so-called Eagle’s Nest – Hitler’s onetime mountain retreat that commands sweeping views of the Watzmann and pine-clad southern Bavaria alike. "
Heidelberg,"Clustering around the pretty River Neckar valley as it cuts through the forested hills at the heart of Baden-Württemberg, Heidelberg is a chocolate box of a town that’s sits crowned by the crumbling remnants of one glorious medieval castle. The citadel rises high above the red-tiled roofs and warren-hole streets of the city Altstadt (Old Town), a romantic district of buzzing student bars and lively music holes, and is served by the Heidelberger Bergbahn funicular. The occasional honorific statue to Goethe and other German poets pepper the centre, while a charming church spire and arched bridges make this forest-shrouded city one that’s simply not to be missed! "
"Bundesverwaltungsgericht, Leipzig","Half a million strong and growing, Leipzig is hailed as Germany’s most happening city. It vies with Berlin in terms of art and history, with sights like the sprawling Renaissance Old Town Hall (the largest in the country), countless hotspots showcasing the great German masters Goethe and Schiller, and one pulsating underground scene that’s lead by artsy, boho types who’ve fled the inflating prices of the capital. That means studios and galleries abound between the elegant baroque opera houses and Bach’s revered sepulchre in the Thomaskirche, while clubs and pubs and old Saxon taverns pepper the fringes of sleepless Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse – the place to come for a beer! "
Cologne,"Dominated on all sides by the soaring Gothicism of the mighty Kolner Dom (a UNESCO World Heritage Site in its own right!), liberal Cologne is unquestionably one of Germany’s must-see metropolises. It can be found on the northern edges of the German Rhineland, where the post-industrial towns of Aachen and Bonn meet on the Rhine-Ruhr. The city’s history goes all the way back to the Romans, while its heritage-packed centre comes peppered with gorgeous Romanesque churches. But the touristy cobbled streets and half-timbered historic buildings of the Old Town are only half the story here. Venture across the Rhine to neighbourhoods like Früh em Veedel to discover the locals sipping their trademark Kolsch beers, or head for the Agnesviertel for the ubiquitous German hipster bars and bohemian drinking dives. "
Nuremberg,"The perfect base point for travelers eager to explore the northern reaches of Bavaria, the historic city of Nuremberg vies with Munich for the top hotspot in the state. And boy does it have some tricks up its sleeve. The onetime epicentre of the Holy Roman Empire, this student-packed town comes crowned with the formidable bulwarks and keeps of the Nuremberg Castle, and is known widely as one of the hubs of Nazi Germany (and also the place of the post-war Nuremberg trials). The centre retains a beautiful historic edge too, with half-timbered facades and tree-dotted cobbled squares, while the beer is top-notch – famed across Germany for its brooding, dark colour and powerful flavours. "
Rothenburg ob der Tauber,"Ye Olde Worlde charm abounds at Rothenburg ob der Tauber; the jewel in the crown of the so-called Romantic Road that runs down from Wurzburg to the depths of Bavaria in a medley of crumbling castles and medieval towns. The piece de resistance here is the Altstadt area, which comes complete with a maze of cobbled lanes and half-timbered Bavarian homes, overhanging lampposts, blooming pots of bougainvillea by summer, arched gateways and some of Europe’s most awesome 14th-century fortification walls. In the midst of it all sits one picture-perfect Marketplace square, bounded by the bulbous domes of the town hall and alive with local cafes and taverns to boot. "
Black Forest,"The stomping ground of the Brothers Grimm and their haunting, timeless fairy-tale creations – Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel et al – the Black Forest dominates the south-western corner of Germany, on the tri-country join with France and Switzerland. Together with its unique position and mythical heritage, the region’s powerful allure emanates from its gorgeous backcountry. This undulates between granite peaks and river-carved valleys, seas of oak and Scots pine, beech and Douglas firs, wild groves of ancient tree trunks and leaf-strewn hiking paths as it runs outwards from the Rhine. And then there’s Baden-Baden – a charming, loveable spa town with plenty of room for relaxation. "
Hamburg Rathaus,"Hamburg pulses. Its docks and harbours – the largest in the country – have imbued it with the honorific epithet of ‘Germany’s gateway to the world’, not to mention one enthralling multi-cultural vibe and moneyed backbone. The centre glows with masterful creations like the Hamburg Rathaus, while the infamous streets and shadowy alleyways of Reeperbahn in Sankt Pauli are famed for their gaudy strip joints and burlesque edginess. Meanwhile, the district of Schanzenviertel beats with a student energy; Parisian-style coffee joints, African world music, Chicagoan jazz and vegan kitchens all coalescing amidst its vibrant squares. Yes sir, Hamburg really does live up to its place as Germany’s second city! "
Bamberg,"Beautiful Bavarian Bamberg is a beer-lover’s dream-come-true, and a veritable postcard-perfect example of a preserved medieval German town besides. Hailed by many as the single prettiest place in the country, the Old Town area (a UNESCO World Heritage Site to boot) comes bisected by the dual channels and canals of the Regnitz and the Main. This charming area conceals elegant cathedrals and the opulent Alte Hofhaltung, however many visitors come just for the breweries, with the pungent and unmistakable aromas of Bamberg’s trademark smoked beer fuelling the student chatter and tourist crowds in the bars. "
"Accra, Ghana","At just over two million inhabitants Accra is the largest city in Ghana. This capital city is full of character and radiates friendliness. Whether you’re there as a solo traveller or with a family, on your big annual holiday or there for business, Accra has something to make you feel comfortable. What tourists really love are the many beaches surrounding the city – particularly Labadi Beach. Accra is home to the National Museum where you’ll find many of the countries historical treasures. You can also visit the National Theatre, International Trade Fair, the Kwame Nkrumah memorial, Independence Square, and W.E.B. Dubois Centre. At every turn you’ll find markets, incredible food, wonderful music, and lots of traffic! Top it all off with a trip to one of the many coffin shops in Teshie. "
Artists Alliance Gallery,"This gallery will blow you away with its contemporary and fine art collections. Created by respected Ghanaian artist, Ablade Glover, the three story gallery is a treasure chest of Kente clothe, furniture, Asafo flags, masks, and unique metal sculptures. You can see almost every prominent Ghanaian artist represented and most of the pieces are for sale. "
Labadi Beach,"Arguably Accra’s most popular beach, Labadi is the perfect city beach. Great food and cocktails are available, as well as local entertainment and people watching. The beach itself is maintained by the surrounding hotels so be forewarned that there is a small entrance fee for those not staying there. If you happen to be there on the weekend you’ll for sure catch some native drumming, local reggae bands, and plenty of spots for dancing to hiplife – a unique music style that blends hip hop with Ghanaian culture. "
Jamestown,"Jamestown is a tough but moving neighbourhood of Accra. There’s a ton of history to discover as both the British and the Portuguese left behind a cultural and architectural legacy. The Jamestown community is close-knit and the atmosphere is lively. There aren’t many markers to explain the context of the history that you’re seeing, so a guide is a welcome addition, but certainly not necessary. The neighbourhood is a cross between rural and urban and is famous for turning out incredible national boxers. "
Cape Coast,"Cape Coast is a former European colonial capital and one of the most culturally significant spots in all of Africa. Originally called Cabo Corso by the Portuguese, the town was once the largest slave trading centre in West Africa. It was here that slaves where brought, locked deep in the towns intimidating castle, and then loaded on to vessels heading to the New World. What you will see and experience here will move you deeply. Today Cape Coast is primarily a fishing town with an artsy vibe. Old colonial buildings line the streets perfect for leisurely strolls. Use Cape Coast as your base for exploring Anomabu, Elmina, and Kakum National Park. "
Kakum National Park,"A visit to Kakum National Park makes a great day trip from Cape Coast. There you’ll find 40 mammal species, 300 bird species, and over 600 butterfly species. The most popular part of the park is the canopy walk. It’s a string of viewing platforms that are linked by safe and bouncy suspension bridges roughly 30 metres above the park floor. For a deeper look into the park, make arrangements ahead of time for a park ranger or guide to take you further in. "
National Museum of Ghana,"History buffs will love the National Museum of Ghana. There are a number of exhibits dedicated to the Atlantic slave-trade and the African lives that where irreparably changed because of it. If you’re looking for a good explanation of the ethnographic diversity of modern-day Ghana, this is the place to go. Get insights into the past and present people, see traditional household objects, art, the royal Ashanti tools, and learn how to weave Kente cloth. "
Elmina Castle,"The first European slave trading post in Africa was Elmina Castle. Built in the 15th century by the Portuguese, it is located in what is now present day Ghana. Over the centuries it’s been controlled by the Dutch and the British and primarily served the Caribbean and Brazil slave routes. You can see the luxury accommodations up top, where the Europeans stayed and then visit the dungeons below where one cell held up to 200 people. It’s a very eye opening look at a difficult aspect of African and European history. The castle is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Monument and is part of the national museum system. "
Busua Beach,"Perhaps the most chill beach in Ghana is Busua. It’s a magnet for the backpacker and volunteer crowds who love to come to unwind on the beach for a few days at a time. Roughly 30k from the city of Takoradi and situated right between Dixcove and Butre, the village of Busua has potential for great excursions, making it an ideal base camp. Many beaches in Ghana have a strong surf, making swimming a little precarious, but Busua waters are as relaxed as its vibe. Because it’s primarily a tourist town, you’ll find great hotels and restaurants, shopping, and renting surfboards and bicycles. "
Mole National Park,"This is the place for family safari’s in Ghana. Mole National Park covers a large savannah filled with African elephants, buffalos, baboons, warthogs, and kob antelopes. You’ll find almost 100 mammal species and at least 300 bird species here. The park allows walking and driving safaris and you can rent a park vehicle if you don’t have your own. Going between December and April is the best time for elephant sightings, though you’re guaranteed to see plenty of mammals’ year round. "
Cape Three Points,"For discerning beachcombers, Ghana offers Akwidaa – with a long and pristine white sand beach, you’ll find it’s one of the best that the country has to offer. Explore the nearby cocoa plantations and forests and get a night-time guided tour of the turtle nesting spots along the beach. If you like, you can take a canoe ride to Cape Three Points, the southernmost tip of Ghana. There’s a great bar scene, good food, and plenty of local attractions to provide a good combination of lazing about and seeing new things. "
Kumasi,"The second largest city in Ghana is Kumasi, once the capital of the powerful Ashanti kingdom. The city itself is still heavy with Ashanti traditions. The main attraction here is the Kejetia market. A place where you can get lost for days. In fact, sometimes the entire city can feel like one big market. Visit the Manhyia Palace and learn about traditional African democracy. While you’re there, don’t forget to check out the National Cultural Centre and sit in on a dance or drumming class. "
Tamale,"Inhabited primarily by the Mole-Dagomba group, Tamale is the country’s northern capital. There are several gorgeous mosques here and the cultural centre has craft shops, dance and music performances. Considered to be the ‘kitchen’ of Ghana, you’ll find fantastic local and exotic foods here. It’s probably the fastest growing city in West Africa and it’s also probably one of the most welcoming. Farmers by tradition, this hot and arid land is located close to the Sahara Desert. Don’t miss the two traditional palaces of Dapkema and Gulkpe Naa. "
Lake Bosumtwe,"Just 32km from Kumasi is Lake Bosumtwe. This crater lake is almost 90 metres deep and created when a large meteorite collided with Earth. The lake is surrounded by fantastic trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. In addition, you’ll find that many locals visit here as the lake is a sacred sight for the Ashanti people. Folklore holds that the people’s spirits come to Lake Bosumtwe after death in order to say goodbye to the god Twi. If you’re looking for a relaxed place for water spots, this is an excellent weekend destination. "
Lake Volta,"The largest man-made lake on Earth is Lake Volta in Ghana. Stay in the neighbouring towns of Ho or Ewe as you explore this lush and beautiful area. Enjoy Aburi botanical gardens, music cruises on the lake, canoeing, monkey sanctuaries, fishing, waterfalls, and a Kente weaving village. If you’re up for it, you can hike to the top of Mount Afadjato, Ghana’s tallest peak. Be sure to check out Shai Hills, a wildlife preserve, and Xavi, a bird watching sanctuary, while you’re there. This is truly one of the most beautiful parts of Ghana and not to be missed. "
Gloucester Cathedral,"On the River Severn, and between the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean, Gloucester has rocketed to people&#8217;s attention in the last few years as a dynamic cultural centre. This has come hand-in-hand with the regeneration of the old shipping Quays, where nightspots and restaurants abound. There&#8217;s riveting history in Gloucester too, as the cathedral makes clear. Constructed in stages between the 12th and 15th centuries it melds Norman and Gothic architecture. A massive pane of medieval stained glass survives in the Great East Window, while there&#8217;s a shrine to King Edward II who was murdered nearby, as we&#8217;ll read about later. On a different note, the maiden flight of the world&#8217;s first jet aircraft took place just outside Gloucester at Brockworth. And to commemorate this there&#8217;s the Jet Age Museum, recounting the earliest years of jet-powered flight. "
"Pump Room, Cheltenham","Right on the western fringe of the Cotswolds, Cheltenham has been a sophisticated playground for the wealthy for more than 200 years. There&#8217;s luxurious shopping and dining, in one of the most regal backdrops you can imagine. The springs in Cheltenham were discovered in 1716, but it was at the turn of the following century that the resort really took shape. During the Regency period the spas were developed and the elegant Montpellier district got its palatial town houses. You can no longer come for hydrotherapy or to take the spa&#8217;s waters, but much of the stately infrastructure is still here, like the Pittville Pump Room and the leafy Pittville Park. "
Cotswolds,"This large Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty rolls out over a vast tract of the Gloucestershire countryside. With bucolic farmland and adorable towns made from the local mellow limestone, the Cotswolds tally with most people&#8217;s image of the English countryside at its most beautiful. The region has hills that rise to more than 300 metres, and culminates at the Cotswold Edge in the west, a dramatic escarpment over the Severn Valley. If you&#8217;re feeling ambitious you could hike the Cotswold Way, a 100-mile National Trail that traces the escarpment in the west. Days will be spent wandering through breathtaking countryside and in the evenings you can pamper yourself at cosy inns and bed &amp; breakfasts. "
Forest of Dean,"Up against the border with Wales in the west of Gloucestershire is 11,000 hectares of ancient woodland, one of the last remaining expanses of this kind of wilderness in the country. The Forest of Dean has been reserved as a royal hunting ground since before the Norman Conquest, which is partly why it has remained mostly untouched for so long. What you get up to in this region depends on your idea of adventure; that could be rock climbing or long-distance hikes, or finding traces of the forgotten mining activity in the forest, or discovering historic sites like Tintern Abbey, just on the Welsh bank of the River Wye. "
Cirencester Church,"This stunning town with Roman origins is an excellent way to enter the Cotswolds. We have to start by mentioning that beautiful Cotswold stone, a golden yellow limestone that imbues every venerable building in Cirecnester with extra splendour. The 14th-century Church of St John the Baptist is glorious in the late-afternoon sun, and has a perpendicular gothic style dating to the 1300s but with earlier elements. In the centre, the Corinium Museum uses Cirencester&#8217;s Roman name and has gathered all of the wonderful finds made around the town. These number more than 60,000 and among them are detailed mosaics, carved marble, pottery and jewellery, all expertly presented by the museum. "
Tewkesbury Abbey,"The small town of Tewkesbury has a big medieval and Tudor character. On Barton Street, High Street and Church Street there are lots of half-timbered houses to turn your head. Among these is the Olde Black Bear, the oldest pub in Gloucestershire, which opened in 1308. In the space of just a few streets there are enough stories and points of interest to keep inquisitive visitors occupied for hours, and the Visitor Centre has booklets to tell you what you&#8217;re looking at. The marvellous Tewkesbury Abbey, with the largest Norman tower in England, survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries as it was bought by the townsfolk and has kept a lot of its Norman detail. Finally, check out the Mythe Bridge crossing the Severn and conceived by celebrated Georgian engineer Thomas Telford. "
Stroud,"Just to the west of the Cotswold Edge escarpment and at the place where the Five Valleys converge,  Stroud is an arty town with steep, winding streets. Lots of artists, authors and musicians have settled in Stroud, including Damien Hirst who has a studio here. On the Bank Holiday at the end of August there&#8217;s also a festival encompassing theatre, art, literature and music. You could venture out into the countryside on the Five Valleys Circuit, or pay a visit to Woodchester Mansion a wistful Gothic revival house left in stasis since work stopped suddenly in 1870. "
Chipping Campden,"In medieval times the wool trade generated a lot of money for the merchants of Chipping Campden, and this gave rise to this small town&#8217;s beautiful church. St James&#8217; is known as a wool church for being exceptionally grand for a town of this size as wealthy benefactors helped fund its construction in the 1400s. The town is a pleasure to tour, being constructed with that Cotswold stone and dotted with eye-catching old structures like the covered market hall and almshouses, both from the early-17th century and with renaissance influences. "
Berkeley Castle,"Two very different things contribute to Berkeley&#8217;s fame, and we&#8217;ll start with the earliest of them. The majestic Berkeley Castle has hardly been changed since the 12th century and has belonged to the Berkeley family all that time. A momentous but also mysterious event in English history happened here in 1327, when the deposed King Edward II was supposedly murdered, although nobody is sure by whom or how. You can even see the cell where the deed is claimed to have been done. Edward Jenner, the physician who invented vaccinations, was born In Berkeley and came back to work in the town in the late-1700s. His beautiful Georgian house is a museum dedicated to the &#8220;father of immunology&#8221;. "
Tetbury Market Hall,"This town has royal ties thanks to Prince Charles who lives on an estate in the area. First, get to the centre of the town to see the unique Market House, which was constructed in 1655 and is supported by three rows stone pillars. It&#8217;s just one of a multitude of listed buildings in Tetbury, which was a wool and yarn town centuries ago, but now does a roaring trade in antiques. And as for Prince Charles, book ahead to be able to enter Highgrove Gardens. This was planted and designed by the prince, with the help of botanical experts, in an attempt to conserve and highlight plants and wildlife native to Britain. "
Bourton-on-the-Water,"In a broad, shallow valley deep in the Cotswolds, Bourton-on-the-Water is a very picturesque village by the River Windrush. The green waterside area stands out for its beauty and draws the crowds in summer, browsing the arts and crafts shops, lingering by the river and treating themselves to ice cream, pub grub, and cream teas. There are some fantastic little attractions to keep you in the village a while longer, like the Dragonfly Maze and the Bourton Model Village. But you should also make time for the larger Birdland, a wildlife park, and the Cotswold Motoring Museum, with a fleet of vehicle going back to the earliest cars and motorcycles. "
Stow-on-the-Wold,"In this town the stone has a richer honey colour than further south, best observed at the marketplace where you can get a good sense of Stow&#8217;s historical importance. If you&#8217;ve seen a few market towns you&#8217;ll realise that Stow&#8217;s square is unusually large. Tens of thousands of sheep changed hands on this spot during semi-annual livestock fairs that were first granted in 1330 by Edward III. Now it&#8217;s a less hectic place, with tea rooms, quaint family-run shops and ice cream stands in summer. But the market cross and town stocks (under an ancient elm) are here, and every October there&#8217;s a famous horse fair in a field outside the town "
"Batsford House, Moreton-in-Marsh","At Moreton you&#8217;re a stone&#8217;s throw from both Warwickshire and Oxfordshire. But before the boundaries were changed in 1931, Worcestershire also made up a quadripoint. There&#8217;s a marker for this boundary just west of Moreton, dating to the 1700s. As a stop on the Roman Fosse Way, the town has long had an important market and been a place for travellers to stop on their journeys. Moreton&#8217;s staging post days are recalled by the many inns around the marketplace, which itself is filled with stalls every Tuesday. You&#8217;ll have lots of family-friendly things to see in the area, like the Cotswold Falconry Centre or, for grown-ups, Chastleton House, a magnificent Jacobean property that recently featured as the home of the Seymour family in BBC&#8217;s production of Hilary Mantel&#8217;s Wolf Hall. "
Lechlade-on-Thames,"In the county&#8217;s  furthest southeastern nook, Lechlade is a pretty village with a very interesting location. That&#8217;s because this is the highest point at which the Thames becomes navigable to barges. At Lechlade the Thames is swollen by its tributary the Coln and then by the Leach, which gives the village its name. The Thames Path National Trail passes by the south side of the village in a bucolic landscape of rich green meadows. You might be tempted to amble along the river for a while, and if you do you&#8217;ll go past numerous concrete pillboxes. These were installed in the early 40s on the 300-mile-long GHQ line, a defensive system in case of a land invasion in the Second World War. "
"Newent, Gloucestershire","Close to the Forest of Dean, Newent has a town centre crammed with historical buildings, and is listed as a conservation area. Dating to the 17th century is the half-timbered Market House, which is raised on wooden piles and once covered a butter market. In September this spot is taken over by merrymaking for the annual Onion Fayre when there&#8217;s live music, market stalls and competitions for judging and eating onions. Another fab time to be here is early spring, because Newent is in an area known as the Golden Triangle thanks to the profusion of daffodils growing of their own accord in the meadows and forest around the town. There are even guided walks at this time of year to show you to the prettiest spots. "
Greenwich,"South of the river and a quick ride on the train, tube or DLR from the centre, Greenwich is awash with royal, maritime and scientific history. It was the birthplace of several Tudor monarchs, including Henry VIII and the biggest reminder of its royal residents is the Queen&#8217;s House, built for James I&#8217;s wife, Anne in the 17th century and backing onto Greenwich Park. Looking down on the palace is the Royal Observatory, also from the 17th century, and the location of the Prime Meridian (GMT). From this hill you can see most of London, and one of the closest monuments is the Old Royal Naval College, whose domed towers you may know from the long list of movies filmed here. And don&#8217;t forget the O2, a giant entertainment venue inside the old Millennium Dome. "
Richmond,"Encompassing an enormous area in southwest London, Richmond is an affluent district endowed with loads of London&#8217;s most cherished locations and attractions. Hampton Court Palace was the home for English Kings from Henry VIII to George II, while the UNESCO-listed Kew Gardens is a botanical garden par excellence, covering a massive swathe of land by the riverside and containing four Grade I listed buildings, including the royal Kew Palace and breathtaking glasshouses. Stop in at a riverside pub and see the herds of deer that roam the national nature reserve at Richmond Park, which has its own royal palace, the Georgian White Lodge. "
"South Bank, London","Rehabilitated for the Festival of Britain after the war, the South Bank is where you can go for a dose of culture and entertainment, just across the water from the City of Westminster. Integrated into the walkways, platforms and staircases of this concrete cityscape are the British Film Institute and the Royal Festival Hall. By the water is the now iconic wheel, the London Eye, the Saatchi Gallery (think Damien Hirst) and the London Aquarium. Continue east along the Thames to the Southwark riverside, where you&#8217;ll encounter the Tate Modern, Britain&#8217;s main national modern art gallery, in a converted brick power station, as well as Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe, a modern replica of the original Globe Theatre. "
Hampstead,"Also extremely wealthy, Hampstead is a district with a village and heath, littered with low-key and gratifying pieces of London&#8217;s history and full of listed buildings. The romantic poet John Keats lived in a house in Hampstead, now on Keats Grove, as did Sigmund Freud, and both of their homes are now museums. At 320 hectares, Hampstead Heath has always been a place where you can flee London&#8217;s bustle, and its meadows and woods were painted by John Constable, yet another famous resident. Get up to Parliament Hill with what is easily the furthest-ranging natural view of London, from Canary Wharf in the east to Battersea Power station in the west. Just east of Hampstead is Highgate, feted for its cemetery where personalities as varied as Karl Marx, Douglas Adams, George Eliot and Lucien Freud are buried. "
Soho,"In the City of Westminster and part of the West End entertainment district, Soho is a vibrant place in a constant state of flux. For more than 200 years it has had a rakish reputation, as London&#8217;s red light district and more recently as  a gay quarter. The heyday for the sex industry was the 1960s and 70s, but that has never been the whole story, as there have always been legendary  venues, clubs and pubs like Ronnie Scott&#8217;s, the Colony Club, the Soho Theatre and the Marquee Club. Some gone and some still in business, but all frequented by a roll-call of cultural icons, from Francis Bacon to the Rolling Stones. "
Clerkenwell,"If you&#8217;re mooching around this part of London you could also have a look around Farringdon and the Barbican, both of which are within walking distance and all border the long-gone walls of the old City of London. Clerkenwell is a unique neighbourhood with Georgian flat-fronted houses and old workshops that once contained breweries and printworks in the 1800s. Those have been replaced by architects, publishers and seriously upmarket restaurants. But the brick buildings and cobbled alleyways remain. For a bit of the old London, pop down to Smithfield Meat Market, which is in a Grade II listed building and has operated on this site for more than 800 years. The pubs around the market have special opening times to accommodate the staff. "
Canary Wharf,"London&#8217;s other financial district is in the revitalised docks in the Borough of Tower Hamlets a few stops east of central London on the Jubilee Line. For tourists there isn&#8217;t a great deal to &#8220;do&#8221; in Canary Wharf, even if there&#8217;s a really good museum about the history of the old docks and a decent shopping centre below One Canada Square, which was the first modern tower at this site. Rather, Canary Wharf is where you can get a handle on the pace of change in London. Before the 90s this place was a deserted remnant from the forgotten days of the Empire and now it&#8217;s a dynamic urban landscape with several of the tallest buildings in Europe. You can catch the River Bus from Canary Wharf Pier downriver to Greenwich or Woolwich or as far upriver as Putney in West London. "
Brixton,"Immigration in the post-War years has given Brixton a large West Indian population. The final decades of the 20th century weren&#8217;t always easy in this district, as you might know from the Clash&#8217;s song the &#8220;Gun&#8217;s of Brixton&#8221; and the riots in 1981 and 1985. But in the last 20 years or so, Brixton has become somewhere to go out, with nightspots like the Fridge and Hootananny, trendy restaurants and one of London&#8217;s best markets, many of which have a Caribbean flavour. Check the listings for the Brixton Academy to see if there&#8217;s a band or artist you like, though you&#8217;ll need to book months ahead if it&#8217;s someone big. "
Camden Town,"Not to be confused with the large borough that surrounds it, Camden Town is one of London&#8217;s alternative areas with five markets, shops for every subculture and masses of bars, popup restaurants, venues for live music and nightclubs. It&#8217;s also a fabulous place to simply go for a walk because of the Regent&#8217;s Canal, which enters the Thames at Limehouse in East London, three miles away. To the south of Camden is the Euston Road, where you&#8217;ll find the British Library, which has a copy of every book ever printed in the United Kingdom and was given a marvellous facelift at the start of this century. "
"Bloomsbury, London","A very grand part of London that took on its current appearance in the 1700s and early 1800s, Bloomsbury is a district of flat-fronted townhouses and generous garden squares where students and office workers will sit out on the lawns for lunch in the summer. The British Museum is in Bloomsbury, while if you walk down for a couple of minutes you&#8217;ll enter Holborn, home of the Old Bailey and so associated with the legal profession since the middle ages. On Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields drop by the Sir John Soane&#8217;s Museum, at the home of one of the architects who helped transform London in the 18th and 19th centuries. "
"The Geffrye Museum (South Side), Hoxton &#8211; London","Just like Brixton, Hoxton is an Inner City neighbourhood that for many years was associated with crime and drugs. But being so close to the City of London, this wouldn&#8217;t last forever. By the 90s media and technology companies were moving onto Hoxton Square and like its neighbour Shoreditch, the district became the haunt of the most fashionable people in town. Bars, restaurants, live music venues and nightclubs are now ten a penny in this neighbourhood. And despite the tide of gentrification there&#8217;s still a reassuring layer of grime thanks to the old housing estates, pubs, &#8220;caffs&#8221; and betting shops on Hoxton Street. "
Wandsworth,"Loads of different areas fall under this Borough next to the river in southwest London. If there&#8217;s one emblematic sight it&#8217;s the four colossal art deco chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, long decommissioned and set to be revamped by Apple in the next few years after decades of inactivity. For dining and nights out, look no further than St. John&#8217;s Hill and Battersea Rise in Clapham, an area that was first en vogue in the 1980s and known for a laid-back atmosphere that 30-somethings will prefer. And to unwind or have a kick about go for Clapham Common, sprawling out over 220 hectares and made famous by the gay community. "
"Clissold Park, Hackney","Another of those districts that people once only heard about on the news, Hackney is an east London area that is still a huge melting pot of different communities but also more fashionable than ever. Come to browse the stalls of the hip Broadway Market on Saturdays or the bustling and friendly Ridley Road Market for Caribbean delights. There&#8217;s everything from comedy to Opera at the Hackney Empire theatre, Victoria Park to the south welcomes a whole calendar of big events in summer and you&#8217;ll have more pubs, bars and places to eat than you could shake a stick at in Hackney Central, South Hackney and Stoke Newington. "
Manchester,"As cosmopolitan as they come, <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-manchester-england/"">Manchester</a> is second only to <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-to-do-in-london/"">London</a> for culture. For dining you could come to Chinatown of the Curry Mile, and if you&#8217;d like some edification there&#8217;s the world-class Museum of Science and Industry, as a nod to the city&#8217;s industrial legacy, and the very large Manchester Art Gallery. The city is a pilgrimage site for lovers of English popular culture, seduced by stories about Factory Records , the  Hacienda and the &#8220;Madchester&#8221; scene. And if you want to see who else is coming through there&#8217;s a plethora of small live music venues, enough to win Manchester the title of best live music city in Britain in 2016. "
Stockport,"Seven miles southeast of central Manchester, Stockport is a town that grew around its cotton mills and the trades that spun off that industry in the 1700s. Hat-making was the biggest of these, and the Hat Works will take you back to the 1800s when Stockport was producing six million units a year. The Plaza in Stockport bucks the decline of Britain&#8217;s art deco cinemas with a gorgeous  variety hall and cinema from 1932, with stylish tea rooms to boot. See also the Stockport Viaduct, created to carry the West Coast Main Line Railway across the Mersey River valley. More than 150 years after it was completed Britain&#8217;s largest brick structure still has the power to amaze. "
Trafford Town Hall,"If you happen to know anything about cricket, Old Trafford, where Lancashire and England play, is the site of the Ball of the Century; Shane Warne&#8217;s legendary leg-break that bowled out Mike Gatting in 1993. That may sound like nonsense to you, but you must have heard of Manchester United, who play their home matches next-door at their 75,635-capacity stadium. Come look around the stands and trophy room of one of England&#8217;s biggest sides. Trafford Park is a former waterfront industrial estate (the first in the world) comprising the Manchester Ship canal and a large system of quays. The container ships are a thing of the past, to be replaced by attractions like the sleek Imperial War Museum North, which puts an emphasis on the Second World War. "
Salford,"This town, directly west of central Manchester has been the scene of massive regeneration in the last couple of decades. Nowhere more so than Salford Quays, across the water from Trafford Park. This is now the home of the futuristic Lowry cultural centre, and several departments of the BBC at MediaCityUK, which moved here in 2011. For a dose of local history see Ordsall Hall, a regal Tudor mansion with elements as old as the 1400s, and a newly-refurbished local history museum owned by Salford. And to illustrate how quickly you can go from an urban landscape to idyllic countryside, come for walk in the village of Worsley, where the sight of the corbelled Worsley Packet House facing the Bridgewater Canal is unforgettably pretty. "
Bolton,"Textiles had been a cottage industry in Bolton from medieval times, after Flemish tapestry-weavers  brought their knowhow in the 1300s. But in the 18th century it became big business thanks to inventions by men like Samuel Crompton and Richard Arkwright, who worked in and around Bolton at this time. So, industrial heritage is an ingredient in Bolton&#8217;s charm, and though the cotton-spinning days are a distant memory several Victorian factories remain and have been turned into attractions like the excellent Bolton Steam Museum. You don&#8217;t need to look hard for traces of Bolton&#8217;s pre-Industrial heritage, at the gothic Grade I-listed Smithills Hall, one of the oldest manors in the region, constructed in the 1300s and 1400s. Also pop in for a pint at Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe, one of Britain&#8217;s ten oldest pubs. "
Rochdale Town Hall,"The Victorian town hall in Rochdale in no ordinary municipal building; it&#8217;s a dignified gothic revival edifice, with Grade-I listing and is held as one of England&#8217;s most prized town halls. You won&#8217;t regret dropping in for a tour to see the stained glass windows, gardens and Great Hall with its organ. There&#8217;s a decent cafe inside too, while the town hall hosts events like Rochdale&#8217;s beer and gin festivals. The wooded countryside is criss-crossed by picturesque vestiges of local industry; you can cycle on the 19th-century Healey Dell Viaduct, which once carried trains, or amble by the Rochdale Canal, where old barges still chug past and anglers settle by the towpath in good weather. "
"Bury, England","It&#8217;s not often that you can find a thriving local food market in England, but the one in Bury is fantastic, open Monday to Saturday and employing as many as 2,000 traders working 400 stalls. Bury is also touted as the &#8220;home of black pudding&#8221;, which has been part of the local diet for centuries. Every September in Ramsbottom there&#8217;s a quirky little pudding throwing contest in which black pudding (a Lancashire delicacy) is thrown to dislodge Yorkshire puddings, recalling the War of the Roses in the 15th century. Another nice surprise is the Met, a performing arts centre in a neoclassical hall, with film screenings, bands and stand-up comedy. "
Wigan Pier,"One of the most iconic examples of English industrial heritage is the Wigan Pier, on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. On these wharfs coal and cotton would be loaded onto barges and transported to the docks at Liverpool. It&#8217;s an atmospheric location, with a cobblestone towpath and a couple of brick industrial buildings. The Trencherfield Mill is now an apartment complex, but still contains a colossal functioning steam engine from 1907. You can come and have a look on Sundays. The Wigan Pier was immortalised by George Orwell in The Road to Wigan Pier, and the author did his research at the Wigan Library, now the Museum of Wigan Life. "
"Oldham, England","You could say that Oldham was the ultimate Industrial Revolution success story; there wasn&#8217;t much here before the 1700s because the soils wouldn&#8217;t sustain crops, but in a matter of decades at the turn of the 19th century Oldham became one of the world leaders in textiles, with mills that operated 24 hours a day. If you&#8217;d like to know more the Saddleworth Museum is in a former textile mill dating to 1862 and has a bit of everything, from historic power looms to the parlour of a wealthy local family in Victorian times. The old mill is on the Huddersfield  Canal, which courses through the scenic Penine landscapes east of Oldham. "
Dovestone Reservoir,"Towards the eastern border of the county, the countryside begins to undulate as you head into the moorland of the South Pennines. The village of Greenfield is a handy gateway to these powerful landscapes at the entrance to the Peak District National Park. There&#8217;s a couple of excursions you could plan from here: Just uphill from the village is the Dovestone Reservoir, the banks of which have wooded green slopes as a backdrop and welcome joggers and dog-walkers. If you&#8217;d like to work up an appetite then above Greenfield is the 370-metre Pots and Pans hill, at the crest of which is a Grade II-listed  memorial for the Great War. "
Ashton-under-Lyne Library,"Another location that didn&#8217;t have much going for it until the explosion of industrial activity in the 18th century. And then in no time at all the skyline became a forest of chimney stacks for weaving and spinning mills, and Ashton-under-Lyne was joined up to the region&#8217;s sophisticated canal and rail infrastructure. The Portland Basin Museum is in the restored Victorian Ashton Canal Warehouse. The museum gives you a sense of what life was like in Ashton when the industry was in full flight, recreating a 1920s street and inviting you to experience life in one of the local coal mines. "
Marple Aquaduct,"The pretty village of Marple is in an idyllic corner of the county, just a few miles from Derbyshire. The landscape is hilly moors and forested valleys where you&#8217;ll come to exciting pieces of industrial infrastructure. The Peak Forest Canal is now used by holidaymakers on barges and is cherished for the old lock flight, made up of 16 locks on a slope, and the Marple Aqueduct, where the canal traverses the River Goyt. Being a leafy, upmarket sort of place, there are three local golf clubs, as well as the Roman Lakes, a natural leisure park for angling, bike-riding and easy rambles. "
"Dunham Hall Lake, Altrincham","A rather upmarket town for professionals commuting to Manchester, Altrincham has no fewer than ten conservation areas. One of these is the Old Market Place, where there&#8217;s a sequence of beautiful wattle and daub buildings, while the town stocks and whipping post at the Buttermarket have been restored (don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;re no longer in use!). For a stately afternoon, Dunham Massey Hall is a Georgian estate from 1730 in marvellous grounds. The gardens have 700 plant species, and there&#8217;s a 300-acre deer park that was a hunting ground in medieval times. Tatton Hall is another National Trust property, with fabulous Italian gardens and a farm where little ones can meet pigs, cows and sheep. "
Leigh,"In the far west of Greater Manchester, and formerly part of Lancashire, Leigh has many of the telltale signs of a cotton-weaving industrial town. Around the centre is a tight rectangular grid system of Victorian and Edwardian workers&#8217; cottages with evocative names like Silk Street, Union Street and Gas Street. The Bridgewater Canal also passes through Leigh to the south and on the banks are imposing red brick cotton mills built in the 1800s. These are all listed buildings so can&#8217;t be demolished. "
"Bridgewater Canal, Sale","A pleasant residential kind of place, Sale has been a commuter town ever since the railways arrived in the mid-19th century. But if you have time to spare you could come for a pub lunch or a wander. One thing to investigate is Walkden Gardens, which is roughly where Sale&#8217;s original medieval manor used to be. Sale Old Hall was demolished in the 1920s, but among the lawns, flowerbeds and archways draped with wisteria is the 400-year-old dovecote that used to be part of the manor. Also perfect strolling territory is the Bridgewater Canal, which will lead you south to Altrincham or up to Stretford a couple of miles north. "
Corfu,"A dog-leg of an island that bridges the gap between the Albanian Adriatic coast and the Ionian Sea of Greece, Corfu really is the stuff of travel brochures. Along its twisting and turning coastline, alabaster beaches like Pelekas and Chalikounas ooze with isolated beauty, while the likes of the Corfu Old Town and Old Perithia burst with Venetian relics, anti-pirate castles and sun-splashed esplanades. Inland and the territory gives way to Corfu’s more untrodden reaches, where forests of sharp cypresses and flailing Spanish fir trees rise with the mountains, and charming villages like Lakones offer a dash of whitewash amidst the greenery. "
Nafplion,"The onetime capital of the 19th-century Greek State and a long term favourite of Athens’ moneyed elite (just check the seaside mansions that line the shore and the bobbing millionaire yachts in the harbour!), Nafplion has been shaped over the centuries by Greeks, Ottomans, Byzantines and others. Cue the soaring and formidable bulwarks of the Palamidi Citadel on the ridges above the town; a 17th-century fortification raised by the Venetians. Then there’s the pretty, marble-clad Constitution Square (a namesake of the national revival that took place here), not to mention the buzzing esplanade along the port – a great place for real, earthy Mediterranean seafood! "
Corinth,"Straddling the join between ancient Attica and the Peloponnese, amidst the ridges of the Oneia Mountains and the sparkling waters of the Corinthian Gulf, Corinth boomed in ancient times. It was made formidable by its navy and its tactical position on the Isthmus of Corinth, which became an important contact point between the two super powers of Sparta and Athens during the tumultuous Peloponnesian War of the early 5th century BC. Corinth sided with the winner and was certainly an ally to be wooed, just as those formidable fortifications, the soaring ancient acropolis (perhaps even more striking than its counterpart in Athens) and the wealth of art and culture displayed in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth show today. "
"Mounth Athos, Greece","Jutting its way out into the Aegean Sea like three arched fingers just south of the lively city of Thessaloniki, the Halkidiki Peninsula comes complete with some of the north’s best beaches and resorts. Golden, powdery sands at Kalamitsi on the end of the Sithonia headland draw a subdued crowd of ecotourists with thier concomitant campsites, while Kassandra knows how to party and comes with seaside cocktail bars and a smattering of swish hotel chains overlooking the Med. Then there’s mysterious Athos – the easternmost peninsular. Defiant and traditional in the extreme, this is where some of Greece’s most traditional monastic communities make their home, clinging fiercely to the ways of the Greek Orthodox Church from their high-perched cloisters in the hills. "
Mycenae,"Raised by mythical cyclops (at least if you believe the legends) and the ancestral home of the mighty King Agamemnon (the same of the Trojan Wars), Mycenae can be found draped over the limestone hills and olive-clad ridges of the Peloponnesian Argolid. One of the less-trodden and more off-the-beaten-track regions of Greece, the spot is unquestionably one of the most immersive and awesome of archaeological remains going. It comes from a much earlier time than the mighty Athenian Acropolis, or the temples of Delphi. In fact, the ruined town here hit its zenith in the 14th century BC with the Atreid dynasty, and it’s from this time that many of its monolith fortifications, striking burial sites and colossal kingly tombs date. "
Delphi,"Hallowed ancient ground abounds in Delphi, standing on its perch on the edge of Mount Parnassus on the fringes of the Corinthian Gulf. For countless centuries this cascading set of breathtaking ruins and looming peristyles was the veritable religious centre of the ancient world; a place sought out by kings and emperors, demagogues and democrats for the portents of its famous oracle and the auspicious rulings of its Pythian priestesses. The piece de resistance of the site has to be the crumbling ruins of the Temple of Apollo, which conceals the old rooms of the sages below its hexastyle Doric columns. There are also lines of ancient treasuries to be seen, built by the various city states of the ancient world, along with one glorious theatre and mountaintop stadium. "
Rhodes,"A teardrop in the Aegean, Rhodes draws booming crowds of tourists each year with its unique combination of shimmering, sparkling beaches, secluded pebble coves, uber-luxurious five-star resorts, fascinating towns and irresistible mountain interiors. Start off with a trip to the ancient settlement of Rhodes city. It clings to the north-eastern coast and was once the home of the mighty Colossus of Rhodes (one of the wonders of the ancient world), although now showcases the beautiful medieval Grand Master&#8217;s Palace (a UNESCO site to boot). Elsewhere and the Valley of the Butterflies blooms with colour, the beaches around Ixia glimmer in the sun, Faliraki’s 18-30 clubs never sleep and the inland villages and castles ooze a more laid-back, Dodecanese charm. "
Zakynthos,"Rugged and rocky Zakynthos rises like a glimmering pearl from the cerulean waters of the Ionian Sea. Chalk-white cliffs delineate its coast, which loom like bulwarks in the west to hide gems like the iconic Navagio Beach (or Shipwreck Beach, if you prefer) and the deep, dark Blue Caves of the northern shore. In the middle of the island, hikers and adventure seekers will discover the fir-dotted, cypress-spotted olive groves that are rarely seen by visitors, while famous Laganas beats and booms in the south-west; an 18-30s hotspot of thumping clubs and cocktail bars that goes into overdrive during the summer high-season. "
Thessaloniki,"Greece’s second largest city makes its home in a tight-knit inlet on the Aegean Sea in the northern reaches of the country. Part booming commercial port town part elegant historical centre part lively university town (there are more students here than in any other place in Greece), the city offers a real plethora of things to see and do. The centre was largely rebuilt following a destructive fire in the early 20th century and now mimics the Byzantine style of the east, while the heritage-packed Ano Poli (Upper Town) that was not burned showcases classic Greek and Balkan architecture. Travelers should be sure to delve into the exhibitions of the iconic White Tower, check out the Museum of Byzantine Culture and see the Ataturk House here, all before letting loose in the tavernas and chic bars of Nikis Avenue and Krini. "
Chania,"Arching its way beautifully along the rugged coastal reaches of northern Crete, Chania conceals tight-knit lanes of Cretan tavernas and salt-smelling fish restaurants aplenty below its terracotta roofs and the stone-clad tower of its Venetian Lighthouse on the edge of the Med. It’s unquestionably one of the most attractive towns on the island, mixing Turkic architecture and Italianate designs along its gorgeous harbourside. There are Ottoman relics and crumbling forts to see too, not to mention some seriously great dishes to sample – from Crete’s own highland greens to dakos pizza breads, uber-fresh olive oils and – of course – potent homebrewed raki. "
Knossos,"Just a short jaunt south out of the Cretan capital of Heraklion, travelers will discover the largest Bronze Age relic in all of Greece: the sprawling Palace of Knossos. Meticulously excavated during the early 20th century and carefully reconstructed in parts, the site reveals many secrets of the ancient Minoans (who dominated this section of the Aegean for almost two millennia). It comes awash with gorgeous mosaics and the famous charging bull frescos, which adorn the central palace structure and the iconic red-painted columns that support it. There are also the remains of Minoan pottery to see, and the resplendent throne room of the Bronze Age kings, the very place where the famous legend of the Minotaur and labyrinth would have played out. "
Athens,"Few cities in the world can boast as much history as Athens. Crowned by the great Parthenon and the sprawling remains of the Agora, it was here that figures like Socrates and Plato, Euripides and Pericles would have stood debating and discussing the issues of the day. It was the birthplace of democracy, which came with Cleisthenes in the late 6th century, and the incubator of all great classical tragedy and comedy: Oedipus Rex; The Antigone; The Phoenician Women. The metropolis remains the largest in Greece too; it’s pulsating, often troubled political kingpin and a place peppered with pretty churches and parliament buildings. Don’t miss the Plaka area, where earthy tavernas cascade through the ancient ruins of the Acropolis hill. "
Olympia,"The birthplace of the Olympic Games is without doubt one of the most totemic UNESCO Heritage Sites in Greece today. Hailed as the heart of the so-called Valley of Gods for its mind-boggling wealth of honorific temples and looming monuments to the likes of Zeus and Hera (many of which are preserved in the on-site archaeology museum), the site also shows the excavated Olympic stadium and training grounds, where athletes would have competed for the prestige of their poleis (city states) all those millennia ago. Nearby, travelers can seek out the natural beauties of the Alfios River valley to boot, and the rugged inland hills of the Peloponnese, complete with hiking and mountain biking trails aplenty. "
Epidaurus,"Once revered by many as the greatest healing place in the ancient world, Epidaurus and its vast array of crumbling ruins can be found clinging to the edges of the Argolid Peninsula just around the Corinthian panhandle. The most famous relic here is the old Sanctuary of Asklepios, which boomed with healers and patients alike from the Classical to the Roman eras. That said, many of Epidaurus’ modern visitors come solely for the colossal amphitheatre at the site’s heart; a 4th-century BC masterpiece which has some of the finest acoustics of any outdoor stadium in the world! "
Meteora,"Like something plucked straight out of James Cameron’s Avatar, the great bluffs and hoodoos of Meteora are all but guaranteed to draw a gasp. Set right in the heartlands of northern Greece, these dramatic pillars of sandstone play host to some of the country’s most traditional Orthodox monasteries – the Holy Monastery of Rousanou, Varlaam and Great Meteoron &#8211; which can be seen clinging tenuously to the precipices in glorious displays of Byzantine and post-Byzantine art and architecture. UNESCO-attested, these breathtaking structures were raised between the 14th and 16th centuries and dominate the awesome mountain landscape of the region. "
Orango Island,"Galumphing hippos drift in and out of the brackish lagoons of Orango Grande, one of the undisputed jewels of the Bissagos Islands and a distinct national park in its own right. In fact, wildlife lovers flock to this small land mass in the Atlantic to see the rare salt-water creatures in their natural habitat, and there are oodles of local guides here that operate wetland safaris out into the waterways and mangroves to see them. Add to that a series of sparkling white beaches, a single, community-run hotel, and a clutch of curious local tribes with long-held traditions, and it&#8217;s easy to see why Orango makes so many a Guinea-Bissau itinerary! "
Bubaque Island,"Nearby to Orango, just across a short strait in the Atlantic to the east, the whitewashed tropical sands of Bubaque come totally deserted; peppered with salt-sprayed driftwood and leaning palms, all looking like something out of Castaway. This is the gateway to the greater Bissagos Islands, thanks to the presence of Bubaque airport and the archipelago&#8217;s largest town, also called just Bubaque. And what a gateway it is! A couple of age-stained colonial edifices line the streets of the city, stilted ports shoulder their way above the water, and the inland is dressed in deep forests that give way only to secluded coves like Bruce Bay and the nameless sands around Ameta. "
Dulombi-Boe National Park,"A land unknown and unmapped, the largest of Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s national parks is one for only the most intrepid of travelers. It&#8217;s packed with winding river channels and pockets of riparian woodland, endless swathes of grassy savannah land that sways in the West African breezes, and the bending courses of the Corubal as it flows from the inland hills towards the Atlantic in the west. Of course, there&#8217;s wildlife too, with the chimpanzee being one of the rarest. You can also expect to see the likes of African cats and oodles of grazing herds amidst the fields. "
João Vieira Island,"The duo of João Vieira and Poilão, another set of specks amidst the much-vaunted archipelago of the Bissagos Islands, is where endangered Atlantic sea turtles clamber over the shells and sandbanks to lay their eggs. Given the exoticism and sheer beauty of their backcountry and coast, it&#8217;s hardly surprising that the whole area is now encompassed by a national marine reserve. Rare groups of tourists pass through, eager to hop aboard a carved piragua (a traditional Guinea-Bissau canoe) and weave between the inlets and wetlands, the sandy stretches and palm-peppered dunes in search of rare marine creatures. "
Bissau Velho,"The political and financial hub of the nation is a place steeped in heritage and culture. Come here to wander between the pollution-stained facades of the old Portuguese center of town: Bissau Velho. This is where the pink-hued palaces of old Iberian governors still line the dusty streets. Also, don&#8217;t miss the grand Presidential Palace, now left empty following the destruction of Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s civil war. Closer to the sea and it&#8217;s the jetties of Pidjiguiti that buzz with life; fishermen hauling the daily catch and bobbing piragua boats waiting to depart for the sun-kissed Bissagos Islands. Other musts include the great Fortaleza (also a top-notch museum), while the nightlife booms after dark with the beats of gumbe and West African kizomba. "
Bafatá,"The fabled birthplace of the celebrated independence revolutionary Abel Djassi, little Bafatá is a riverside town with panache. Proud of its political traditions and beautifully imbued with green areas, swaying palm trees and the meanders where the Geba joins the Colufe, it&#8217;s a place to come and sample the laid-back bucolic vibes of one of the country&#8217;s provincial hotspots. But that&#8217;s not it, because Bafatá is also surrounded by the rolling gallery jungles that occupy the heart of the nation; the home of crocs, interesting West African mammals, rare monkeys and more… "
Lagoas Cufada Natural Park,"A playground for hippos and huge waterbucks, for galloping herds of African buffalo and laughing hyenas, snapping crocs and stalking leopards, the Lagoas Cufada Natural Park is one of the most biodiverse regions in all of Guinea-Bissau. Sandwiched between the Rio Grande de Buba to the south and the wide Corubal to the north, the reserve gets its name from the countless lagoons and wetland habitats that erupt along its fringes. And between the lot are swathes of palm oil groves, where even chimpanzees have been reported to swing in the branches! "
Cacheu,"Cacheu has sat on the meandering courses of the river of the same name for hundreds of years. Many consider it to be one of the earliest European settlements in West Africa; once prized for its prime location on the edge of the great waterway that leads up and into the continental highlands and the turns of the Canjambari River. That all made the town a slaving center from the 1600s onwards, and today many of the ageing relics here stand as testimony to that dark history, like the soot-smothered fort that was first raised by the Portuguese in the 16th century. There&#8217;s also an enthralling local craft market, and sweeping vistas of mangrove swamps to explore. "
Bolama Island,"Complete with a welcoming NGO-run hotel and a smattering of fascinating (and dilapidating) colonial builds, Bolama Island is the closest of the Bissagos to the mainland and the capital of Bissau. Regular piragua canoes take the few travelers who head this way straight across the Atlantic waters from the harboursides of Pidjiguiti. Once they arrive it&#8217;s a medley of old colonnaded state buildings and crumbling Portuguese mansions that&#8217;s on the menu, all dating back to the nigh on forgotten days when this island city reigned as the capital of the country as a whole! "
Varela,"Continuing on the with fabled handsome beachfronts of the Senegalese Casamance region – which is actually contiguous with Varela – this stretch of gorgeous coastline in the extreme north of the country is now a national park to boot. And for good reason too! Just check out those shimmering, scintillating West African sands that come punctuated by the occasional stream of muddy mangrove rivers, the populations of sea turtles, or the dusty dunes where sea grasses bristle in the salty breeze. And away from the shore there are more treats: savannah grasses and dense forests; Nile crocodiles and hippos; Djola tribal villages and plenty, plenty more! "
Rubane Island,"Five hours by regular ferry from the archipelago hub of Bubaque, Rubane beckons travelers with its patchwork of verdant backcountry forests and ivory-white sands. Groves of tall palm trees fringe the shorelines all over the place, punctuated by the occasional cliff, or even the timber villas of the Ponta Anchaca resort – the only place to stay here. There are clusters of small fishing hamlets to wander around the isle, the boats of locals forever bobbing around the shore, along with oodles of totally deserted coves, where the powdery yellow sands lift oh so softly from the water. "
Gabú,"Set deep in the heartlands of Guinea-Bissau, the regional kingpin of Gabú hails in as the second-largest urban spot in the country. It&#8217;s a place very apart from the capital at Bissau. For one, the dominant faith here is Islam, while the meek meanders of the dusty Rio Compossa are nothing on the roaring Atlantic rollers out west. The result is a cultural hotspot that that oozes all the charm of a Saharan trading post. And talking of trading: The market bustles and throbs with chatter and exotic goods brought in from Senegal, Guinea and the Ivory Coast – don&#8217;t miss it! "
Farim,"Set to the scents of peanuts and cashews, of raising cattle and palm oil plantations, the outback town of Farim is one of Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s more off-the-beaten-track stop offs. It was first raised by the country&#8217;s onetime Portuguese rulers as an outpost against tribal attacks in the north. Soon, it grew into a fully-fledged market town packed with trading caravans from as far afield as Libya and Morocco. Today, the place is a charming, if rustic, affair that rises from the green, green banks of the Cacheu River in a medley of tin-roofed homes and traditional yurt-style hamlets. "
Saltinho,"A small stretch of river way that runs through the heart of untouched jungles close to the town of Mampatá, some 30 or so kilometers from the capital at Bissau city, Saltinho offers a glimpse of GB&#8217;s beautiful backcountry. An arched steel bridge silhouettes against the red-glowing sky. Bobbing canoes laden with arched-back local fishermen move side to side on the currents. Children jump and dive from the rocks. The piece de resistance has to be the eponymous Saltinho Waterfalls though, which gush over a series of stepping stones and escarpments – it&#8217;s all truly breathtaking! "
Parque Nacional das Florestas de Castanhez,"Take the untrodden tarmac road into the deep south of Guinea-Bissau, where dusty plumes of mud rise and fall in the heat, and the colossal trunks of palm trees pepper the ridges. Here, the Florestas de Castanhez National Park host some of the last remaining tracts of GB rainforest. Those who venture in – and few do – will be able to hike the rambling trails and see groups of baboons and chimps in the palms above, while the reserve also spills out onto the Atlantic, where African manatees and salt-water hippos rarely fail to get the cameras snapping! "
"Conakry, Guinea","Pulsating to very African rhythms with its patchwork of markets (just check out the colourful veg in Madina bazaar), beer bars and Malinke music dives, Conakry is everything you&#8217;d expect of a capital representing one of West Africa&#8217;s most haphazard nations. Coups and counter coups have unfolded (often bloodily) between its streets over the decades, and in the heart of the town still stands the haunting remnants of Camp Boiro, where political prisoners were tortured during the upheavals under President Sékou Touré. However, pretty and important sights like St. Mary&#8217;s Cathedral and the National Museum of Guinea do well to balance all that out these days. "
Iles de Los,"A spattering of islands that sits just off the coast from the beating streets of Conakry city, the Iles de Los offer a glimpse of what Guinea could be, or would be, were it not for its unstable political life. Sprawled out over the islands of Tamara, Roume and Kassa (along with a few smaller add-on isles), the archipelago is a place of sloping golden sands and mangroves, lanky palm trees and the salty froth the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the top beaches line the coastal stretches of Ile de Roume and Kassa, with a smattering of resort hotels on offer, and easy access from the jetties of the capital by boat. "
National Park of Upper Niger,"Dominating a whopping 6,000 square kilometers in the midst of eastern Guinea, the National Park of Upper Niger (or the National Park Haut Niger, as it’s known locally) is now on the very forefront of West African conservation. A vast expanse of riparian woodlands and savannah, winding rivers and montane thickets is home to some of the only remaining dry forest in the country. Between the tree boughs and canopies, the reserve hides chimpanzees and Gambian mongooses, uber-rare West African manatees and curious giant pangolins. For outdoorsy types and wildlife lovers, it&#8217;s surely the biggest attraction in the country! "
Nzérékoré,"This fast-growing city has been a regular receptacle for refugees fleeing conflicts in other West African countries to the south. Consequently, there&#8217;s a truly diverse population of locals inhabiting the sprawling barrios and shanty towns that emerge from the sweeping forest lands that run along the length of the Liberian border, not to mention a thriving series of markets in the heart of the city. Moreover, Nzérékoré is known for its silver smiths and great location just a stone&#8217;s throw from both the Forêt Classée de Diécké to the south, and the wildlife-rich hills of Mount Nimba to the east. "
Fouta Djallon Highlands,"A carpet of green interspersed only by the occasional hoodoo and craggy protrusion of ancient sandstone rock, weathered and eroded away by century after century of attrition, covers the vast expanse known as the Fouta Djallon. Occupying the heart of Guinea, this verdant landscape of jungle-dressed valleys and lichen-spotted stones has garnered a reputation as one of the most beautiful in the country. Hikers come to scale the lookouts of Petteh Djiga, to spy out the headwaters of the Gambia and Senegal rivers, to encounter the rustic farming communities of the Mande peoples, and plenty, plenty more. "
Mount Nimba,"Straddling the tristate join of Guinea, Ivory Coast and Liberia in the extreme south-east of the nation, Mount Nimba marks the highest point in the wild and rugged Nimba Range. It arches like a great, grass-clad backbone from the rolling fields of swaying savannah that surround it, with verdant highland meadows and lawns of green that are often far above the clouds. Today, the whole area is an ecotourist&#8217;s dream-come-true, and comes complete with a UNESCO tag that&#8217;s intended to protect all the otherworldly and endangered creatures within: the viviparous toad; zebra duikers; pygmy hippos – the list goes on! "
Cape Verga,"Bamboo beach huts and swaying coconut palms, shimmering yellow sands and the endless crash of the Atlantic rollers make Cape Verga – poking its way out of the Guinea coastline some hours&#8217; drive north out of Conakry – seem more akin to the fabled beach paradises of Madagascar or the Caribbean. You might just have to pinch yourself to remember you&#8217;re in West Africa, but that&#8217;s okay, because you&#8217;re almost bound to have the beaches of Sobane and Bel Air (the home of President Conte&#8217;s all-new resort hotel – a dubious construction) almost entirely empty; save for the seagulls, the occasional sunbather and old, salt-sprayed granite boulders. "
Labé,"Situated almost smack bang in the heart of Guinea, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the rising peaks and forests of the aforementioned Fouta Djallon, Labé represents the second-largest city in the entire country. Benefitting from a historic location on the crossroads of some of West Africa&#8217;s most important trading routes, this one&#8217;s market (known suitably as the Grand Marche) booms daily with sellers from a far afield as Senegal, Mali and Morocco. There&#8217;s also a fine local museum that chronicles the fascinating cultural history of the Fouta Djallon region. The roaring cataracts of the Chutes de Sala are also day-trip territory from Labé. "
Faranah,"The birthplace of Guinea&#8217;s onetime leader, Sékou Touré, Faranah is has transformed from tiny little agriculture town in the heart of the nation to a built-up provincial center in just the last century. One of the favoured gateways to the popular Haut Niger National Park (which lies just a stone&#8217;s throw to the east), it&#8217;s also got a large mosque and oodles local marketplaces to explore. Add to that a surprisingly lively nightlife, and it&#8217;s easy to see why Faranah is slowly becoming more of a staple on the intrepid traveler&#8217;s route through West Africa. "
Kindia,"Just a short ride through the West African savannah from the throbbing capital city of Conakry, the little bucolic getaway of Kindia offers a respite from the urban fray of Guinea&#8217;s coast. Head into the small provincial town of low-rise cottages and the occasional thatched hamlet to experience the day-to-day vibes of country life. You&#8217;ll get to sample fou fou breads in tasty okra sauce, wander the marketplace and even break out into the fringes of the Fouta Djallon Region, where the dramatic plug-hole waterfalls of Voile de la Mariee carve the rocks in two. "
Kankan,"Sprawled out over the eastern plains of Guinea and occupying more land even than the capital, Kankan is hardly the most compact city in West Africa. However, neatness has never been this historical spot&#8217;s strong point, and today visitors will need to navigate the dusty streets and the meanders of the Niger River to uncover tales of its past importance as the heart of the erstwhile Baté Empire. And in the present day, Kankan has made a name for itself as one of Guinea&#8217;s great learning centers, not to mention an important stopover on the way through to Mali. "
Boké,"Little Boké was a boomtown in the dark, dark years of European slave trading in West Africa. Along its harbours and jetties, all lining the meanders of the Rio Nunez, thousands of convoys of human cargo once departed for the Atlantic coast just a little to the west. Today, the visceral reality of this past can still be seen in the fort-prison come museum of Fortin de Boké, which does well to chronicle the lives and plight of captured slaves during the era. The town&#8217;s location also makes it a prime place to stopover on the way from Conakry to the Guinea-Bissau border in the north. "
Dubreka,"Straddling the inlets of Sangareya Bay and the winding water channels, bayous and vast expanses of mangrove swamps that edge out towards the Atlantic in this part of the country, little Dubreka offers an interesting little picture of rural Guinea life. However, with the great table-top mountains looming above, it&#8217;s easy to see that the natural side of things are the town&#8217;s biggest draw. And none can rival the roaring waterfalls of the beautiful Les Cascades De La Soumba, which drizzle and crash over a series of rocky escarpments close to the center. Don&#8217;t forget the camera! "
Massif du Ziama,"A seemingly endless dash of greenery that occupies the deep southern reaches of eastern Guinea, the Massif du Ziama is considered one of the most important reserves in the nation. It&#8217;s dressed in dense, misty swathes of dabema and bako trees, trodden by snapping crocs and the carapaces of tortoises, not to mention some of Guinea&#8217;s most remote human tribespeople. Tagged as a biosphere by UNESCO, the 1,000 square kilometer area of the Ziama Forest that sits atop the plateaus is of special importance to conservationists. "
Kissidougou,"Kissidougou is one of the rapidly-expanding cities of southern Guinea. Imbued with the cultural diversity of Liberians and Ivorians, all mingled and mixed with the traditions of the ethnic Kissi peoples native to the prefecture, its ramshackle markets and mud-caked streets ooze a certain charm. However, it&#8217;s the hills that surround 100,000-strong Kissidougou that are really of interest. It&#8217;s here that great fields of coffee beans herald in some of Guinea&#8217;s top plantations, and where the West African forests begin to sprawl over the hills. There&#8217;s also a great museum, for that fix of local history and heritage. "
"Georgetown, Guyana","The place where so many Guyanese come to shop, work and play is actually something of a shadow of its former self. In fact, there’s no question that Georgetown’s golden age came with the height of the colonial powers here, a fact that its name – made in honour of England’s King George III – implies. Miners, plantation builders, architects, statesmen and more all flocked to this corner of Demerara-Mahaica to play their part as the city went from Dutch to French to British rule, imbuing the town with the likes of Stabroek Market and whitewashed St George&#8217;s Cathedral as they went. The Parliament Building is also worth a stop-off, while the national museum is a great place to get acquainted with local history. Oh, and the Demerara Rum Distillery is a welcome break from the heritage! "
"Boat selling fruits and vegetables, Linden","For almost a whole century, the settlement of Linden has been Guyana’s primary mining hub, with thousands of prospectors and miners making their way to this tropical spot to pull bauxite from the hills that line the Demerara River. Today, the history and development of this mining past is chronicled in the Linden Museum of Socio-Cultural Heritage in the centre of town, revealing the evolution of the place from tented outpost in the early 1900s to mechanised industrial center today – even if many of the shaft mines have now shut down. Other travelers will want to make a beeline for Gluck Island on the Essequibo to the west, with its red howler monkeys, colossal lily pads and tropical bird watching. "
Kanuku Mountains,"The great peaks of Kanuku are divided in two by the long and winding water channels of the Rupununi River, separated into a duo of diamond-shaped highland regions that are both famed for their wealth of mammalian species and old growth forests. It’s actually rather rare that travels will make their way this deep into the southern recesses of the nation, passing the tepui peaks of Potaro-Siparuni and traversing great stretches of savannah and lowland forest to get here. Those who do come, however, can spy out the rare harpy eagle, giant otters in the riparian habitats and the colossal (though now rare) pirarucu fish. "
"Bartica, Guyana","Straddling the channels of the Essequibo River where it joins the meanders of the Cuyuni and gives way to the wilder, less inhabited heartlands of Guyana, Bartica was once known as the ‘Gateway to the Interior’. It was a popular stop-off for prospectors and miners making their way to the far-flung gold and mineral dig sites that erupted by the bucket load between the mountains of Potaro-Siparuni in the last century, while today it still bustles with cargo barges and river-dwelling folk, all of whom happily hop between the town’s Brazilian eateries and clutch of bubbling local beer bars during the weekend. "
New Amsterdam,"Since its foundation in the middle of the 18th century, New Amsterdam – the regional capital of East Berbice-Corentyne – has flitted from Dutch masters, who held sway over the lowland plantations here from the citadel of Fort Nassau up the valley (the remains of which can still be visited today), to the British, who endowed it with ground-breaking sanitation laws and attracted the likes of Cesar Castellani (perhaps the most famous architect to grace Guyana with his work). As testimony to Castellani’s influence, the masterful facades of the New Amsterdam Public Hospital still adorn the streets, while New Amsterdam’s trio of downtown strips pulses with marketplaces and light industry to boot. "
Port Mourant,"Port Mourant is a small and welcoming little town on Guyana’s Atlantic coastal stretches, famed for its prolific output of cricketers (the sound of cork on willow is the usual backing track to daily life here!) and as the birthplace of the county’s revered ‘Father of the Nation’: Dr Cheddi Jagan. The down-to-earth spot is also a great place to glimpse Guyana’s agricultural heartland, with famer’s markets touting fresh fruits straight from the fields. A resident population of students add a youthful edge to the place, while the nearby urban center of Rose Hall is interesting in that it’s Guyana’s smallest town. "
"Kaieteur Falls, Kaieteur National Park","The jewel of the Potaro-Siparuni region is a vast and expansive protected area that rises and falls with the great bulwark ridges of the Guyana tepuis. Dressed in thick, monkey-dotted, jaguar-stalked rainforests and covering a whopping 62,000 hectares, it’s hailed as the ecotourist hotspot for the country. And while the biodiversity and untouched virgin woods are real pulls, the piece de resistance here is unquestionably the Kaieteur Falls. Cascading a mind-blowing 226 meters down the escarpments of the Pacaraima Mountains, these dwarf both the Niagara and Victoria Falls alike, and cast plumes of tropical mist into the jungle airs all around. Yes sir, a trip here is a must! "
"Orinduik Falls, Guyana","Carving their way out of the rocks that roll out from the Pakaraima Mountains in the western reaches of Guyana, just on the border with Venezuala, the Orinduik Falls offer something a little different to the country’s great cascading cataracts that fall from the top of its tepui hills. Visitors who make their way to these far-flung spots can enjoy a more up-close-and-personal experience, swimming in the plunge pools and hiking the ridges around the site, taking in the layers and terraces of rock as they go. What’s more, the channels of the Ireng River offer up oodles more waterfalls along their courses, like the more remote Kurutuik Falls in the jungles to the north. "
"Essequibo River, Parika","Tin shack docks and streets of purring scooters form the heart of riverside Parika; a down-to-earth port town on the banks of the Essequibo. At once gritty and welcoming, this gateway to the Essequibo Islands and river boat terminal is a fine place to sample the real, raw character of Guyana’s coast. Don’t miss the buzzing market that erupts in the town each Sunday. Haggling locals descend by their hundreds, flitting between the stacked stalls of bananas and coconuts, dubious parrot-sellers and fish emporiums. Parika is also the jumping off point for Baganara Island – a well-kempt luxury resort island in the midst of the Essequibo waters. "
"Shell Beach, Guyana","A salt-sprayed section of the Guyana Coast, where the Atlantic rollers meld with the Caribbean currents out at sea and mangroves sprawl and crawl along the sands to the shore, Shell Beach is unquestionably the most famous beach in the country. But people don’t come to sunbathe and swim. They come for the turtle nesting phenomena that occurs every year from late-March to late-summer, when sea turtles of all shapes and sizes &#8211; leatherbacks and hawksbills and olive ridleys and greens – flock to the shoreline to lay their eggs. Heading here is also a great chance to see some of South America’s undeveloped coastline, where rustic villages and bamboo huts pepper the lagoons and the sand is fringed with wild stretches of jungle. "
Mount Roraima,"Arguably the most glorious of all the South American tepuis, sheer-cut Mount Roraima is a table top mountain that rises like a petrified oblong of chiselled rock, right on the edge of Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana. Largely unknown, the mountain is actually one of the most ancient geological formations on the planet, with its roots back in the Precambrian period more than two billion years ago. It lurches vertically from the ground, soaring 400-meters straight up from the grasslands and woods below. A challenge even for the most experienced hikers and mountain climbers, the top of the plateau here is a treasure box of natural wonders, with uber-rare pitcher plants and algae, reptilians and amphibians inhabiting the summit, untouched and unhindered by the predators in the flats below. "
"Iwokrama Forrest, Guyana","The Iwokrama Forest represents one of the last remaining swathes of pristine primeval rainforest on the planet. It sits nestled in the very heart of the country, where the sheer-cut tepuis of the highlands give way to the tropical lowlands, feeding the verdant canopies with their countless arrays of glorious waterfalls and mountain streams. The forest is famed for its soaring canopies (which hits heights of a whopping 30 meters in some sections), where oodles of endangered bats, harpy eagles, multi-coloured frogs and lizards all flit between the waxy boughs and the undergrowth. Jaguars, giant armadillos and howler monkeys are among the curious beasts too, and travelers can opt to safari here across rope bridges and mud tracks from one of the few lodges that now pepper the river channels. "
Kamarang Great Falls,"Far-flung Kamarang in the depths of western Guyana comes shrouded by great swathes of old-growth rainforest. The remote and largely inaccessible spot (the most popular way to get here is by private charter plane) was once just a humble Amerindian tribal settlement on the edge of the wild Pacaraima Mountains, which rise in stepped rock terraces and table-topped bluffs all over the region forming the bulwark of rock that is now the border with Venezuela. Today, Kamarang is something of a boomtown, famed as the home of some of Guyana’s richest mineral and gold veins. It’s also something of an up-and-coming tourist spot, with the uber-dramatic and largely unseen Kamarang Great Falls lurking amidst the jungles close by! "
"Fair View, Guyana","Fair View is a tiny conglomeration of bamboo homes and stilted longhouses that rises from amidst the waxy canopies of Potaro-Siparuni – the wild and virtually unexplored hinterland that forms the very heartlands of Guyana. Inhabited by welcoming Amerindian folk with a perennial smile, the spot was only connected to the rest of the country by road in 1992, meaning this one’s Makushi traditions and intimate connection with the Iwokrama woodlands that dominate all around are just about as raw and real as they come. Travelers head here for up-close-and-personal cultural encounters, to hike Guyana’s primeval forests and to swim in the plunge pools of the Kurupukari Falls alike. "
Anna Regina,"Indelibly clean and well-to-do, Anna Regina is a patchwork of whitewashed garden fences, pristine frontispieces and sun-splashed streets. Fruit vendors line the roadways touting tangerines and mangos, while the Damon Monument – the town’s main historical attraction – pays homage to the martyred slave rebel who helped with revolts in Essequibo during the first half of the 19th century. Anna Regina is also the base for hitting the resorts around Mainstay Lake, where charming cottages abut the water and mix with the earthy villages of indigenous Arawak folk beneath a canopy of palms. "
Portsmouth,"There simply isn&#8217;t a better place to come than Portsmouth if you&#8217;re fascinated by England&#8217;s naval history. There has been a military harbour here since the Romans, and astounding pieces of heritage are presented to the public: HMS Victory was Lord Nelson&#8217;s flagship on which he was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Then there&#8217;s the incredible story of the Mary Rose, a Tudor warship that sank in the Solent in 1545 before being raised in 1982, restored and finally shown to the public along with its artefacts in 2016. And you can also be brought up to date with a boat tour around the harbour where the modern navy is anchored. "
Southampton &#8211; Livingston Road,"A cultured spa town in the 1700s, Southampton exploded in Victorian times when the docks were built and the shipyards moved in. At this time the city was known as the &#8220;Gateway to the Empire&#8221;.  You may be surprised to read that a third of the victims in the Titanic disaster were from Southampton, and as the ship set sail from this port it makes sense that this should be where you can indulge your curiosity on a designated &#8220;Titanic Trail&#8221;. The SeaCity Museum has first-hand accounts and artefacts to give you fresh insights. The spitfire, a British design icon was also born in Southampton; track the history of this Second World War fighter plane at the Solent Sky Museum. "
New Forest,"Most of the New Forest National Park&#8217;s 380 square kilometres of beech and oak forest, open pasture and heathland lies within Hampshire&#8217;s boundaries. For nature-lovers, walkers and campers nothing else in the southeast of England or the home counties compares to it. Roaming free in these woods and on the moors are cattle, New Forest ponies, deer and donkeys, which you&#8217;ll spot on refreshing rambles and bike rides. But there are quite a few man-made attractions, from real ale breweries to the sumptuous 13th century Beaulieu Palace House, where the gorgeous Beaulieu Abbey and the National Motor Museum are set. "
Winchester Cathedral,"Founded by the Romans as Venta Belgarum, Winchester is steeped in history. In Saxon times the 9th-century King Alfred the Great made Winchester the capital of Wessex and then all of England after fending off the Vikings. With the longest nave of any gothic cathedral in Europe, the Norman Winchester Cathedral is outstanding, and also the resting place of the author Jane Austen. If you&#8217;re a history buff you could be here for hours. But there are other medieval sights that deserve your time in Winchester, like the 14th-century Winchester College, the 12th-century St. Cross Hospital and the majestic Great Hall of the former Winchester Castle. Add to that a working watermill and a fine array of museums, and Winchester becomes a destination that needs at least a couple of days. "
South Downs National Park,"A vast swathe of hilly countryside, the South Downs National Park takes up much of East Hampshire and push on as far as Winchester in the centre of the county. A typical scene in this newly-delineated park is green rolling hills, hedgerows, quaint villages with thatched cottages and friendly country pubs. It&#8217;s a destination where you can bring children to find out about the ways humans have shaped the landscape through farming and forestry, at an educational farm. And to strike out on blissful walks in undulating fields with sheep and cows and meadows speckled with wildflowers in June. "
"Charlton Lakes in Andover, Hampshire","As you head northwest you&#8217;ll drive through bucolic countryside of smooth chalk hills. Andover is right in the Hampshire Downs, one of the most fertile farming regions in southern England and covered with undulating wheat fields. The tallest of the hills in this region were Iron Age hill-forts, and this goes for Danebury near Andover. Take a peek at the free Museum of the Iron Age in Andover to gaze at some 5,000-year-old artefacts unearthed on the hill. Also local is the Finkley Down Farm Park with all of the kids&#8217; farmyard favourites, and the Hawk Conservancy Trust that puts on birds of prey shows. "
Romsey Abbey,"The Test Valley is adored for its quaint towns and villages, and the market town of Romsey is up there with the prettiest. Standing tall in the centre is a Norman abbey that survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries because it was also used by the townsfolk as a parish church. Go in to marvel at the beautiful architecture and stained glass windows and learn some unexpected stories about the community of nuns who lived here. The streets around the abbey are very cute, and lined with 18th-century townhouses and half-timbered inns and cottages. In July and August you can book a tour of the regal Broadlands, the country estate where Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip spent their honeymoon in 1947. "
Alton Castle,"Tuesday is market day in Alton, and if you show up you&#8217;ll be attending an institution that goes back to at least the 11th century; not only that but it was the most valuable to be listed in all of the venerable Domesday book in 1086. The 11th-century Church of St. Lawrence saw the final hours of the Battle of Alton in the English Civil War, when Royalists holed up around the church and were eventually overcome by the Parliamentarians. You can still make out the damage from musket shots in the south door. There&#8217;s a lot of compelling details inside, including 15th-century frescos, an Anglo-Saxon font and a small hoard of artefacts dating to the battle in 1643. "
Lymington,"On the southern boundary of the New Forest, Lymington is an elegant Georgian coastal town at the mouth of the river of the same name. Being on the Solent, sailing is part of the culture in Lymington, and is as good a place as any to take lessons. You can let someone else do the navigating by crossing over the strait to the Isle of Wight or embarking on a short voyage up the Lymington River into the New Forest where semi-wild ponies graze on the banks. The town warrants an amble for its tight cobblestone streets, inns and flat-fronted houses, and was the haunt of smugglers in the 18th century. The newly restored Lymington Open Air Sea Water Baths is the oldest lido (outdoor pool) in the UK, dating to 1833. "
Basingstoke,"Basingstoke was a originally a smallish market town, but expanded dramatically in the post-war period as a commuter town for London. By train you can get here from Waterloo in 45 minutes, while the M3 motorway passes close by. With lots of accommodation it&#8217;s a useful place to base yourself and then take excursions to all the interesting places close by. One is Silchester, a village next to what used to be a Roman Oppidum, where perhaps the best-preserved Roman wall in England can be seen. At the Milestones Museum you&#8217;ll sample life in Hampshire in Victorian times and the 1930s. Potter around reconstructions of homes, amenities and street scenes, enriched with real artefacts like a vintage Portsmouth tramcar and vehicles made by defunct Hampshire manufacturers like Taskers of Andover and Thornycroft. "
Lyndhurst,"The unofficial capital of the New Forest, Lyndhurst is the largest village in the park. After the New Forest was declared a royal hunting ground in the 1070s this location would be visited by royalty for almost 800 years. Many came to a manor on the site of the present Queen&#8217;s House, which was rebuilt in the 1600s, and King George III was the last monarch to stay here in 1789. St. Michael and All Angels Church is from  Victorian times, but you need to check out the interior frescos, painted by the pre-Raphaelite Frederic Leighton. And of course, there are natural attractions all around Lyndhurst, like the deer sanctuary where you should see the herds if you go quietly. "
Chawton House,"Moments from Alton is the small village of Chawton, which will forever be linked to Jane Austen, one of Britain&#8217;s most celebrated authors. She spent the last eight years of her life in a cottage here, during which time she revised Sense and Sensibility and wrote Mansfield Park and Persuasion. Her house is now a museum, and indispensable for Austen enthusiasts. There are sights around the village to add some colour to your Austen tour; Jane&#8217;s mother and sister are buried at St. Nicholas Church, while the Elizabethan manor, Chawton House was owned by Jane&#8217;s brother and is the home of a foundation for early women&#8217;s writing. You can tour the house on weekday and Sunday afternoons. "
Stockbridge,"It comes in a small package, but the village Stockbridge is flush with listed historic buildings. There are more than 20, most from the 1600s and 1700s, and the oldest with elements going back to the 1200s. Like several high streets in the region, the main road through Stockbridge is noticeably wide. This is a vestige from when Stockbridge was on a cattle drovers&#8217; road; shepherds would walk their livestock all the way from Wales to sell in London in medieval times. You&#8217;re also on the edge of the Salisbury Plain in Stockbridge, a massive chalk plateau that has been an army training area since the 19th century. See the Museum of Army flying in nearby Middle Wallop for a wonderful cache of vintage planes and rotorcraft. "
Petersfield,"Ensconced in the gentle green landscapes of the South Downs National Park, the village of Petersfield was built from scratch in the 12th century. Here from the start was the Church of St. Peter, dating to 1120 and despite a few alterations down the years a great deal of the architecture maintains the sober Norman style. Come for the markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, as well as the farmers&#8217; market on the first Sunday of the month. On the high street  is a &#8220;physic garden&#8221; planted with the same species you&#8217;d have found in a medieval medicinal garden. The nature outside Petersfield is stunning, and nowhere more so than Heath Pond, set in acres of heathland and a haven for waterfowl. "
Titchfield Abbey,"Tucked into the western nook of Portsmouth harbour is the market town of Fareham. This place saw a lot of development  in the 60s and 70s, so isn&#8217;t the most charming of these picks. But there&#8217;s much to recommend it close by. First you&#8217;ve got the ruins of Titchfield Abbey, which are managed by English Heritage and have survived far better than most. You can even see a medieval floor mosaic in the refectory reminding monks to remember the poor. Also close is Portchester Castle once a hunting lodge for King John, and briefly captured by the French in the early 13th-century. Get the inside track on Fareham&#8217;s story at the Westbury Manor Museum, where you&#8217;ll find out about the local brickworks  that supplied the bricks for the Royal Albert Hall. "
"Cathedral, Hereford","The medieval Cathedral is top of the pile of things to see in Hereford, not just for its architecture but what it contains: On display inside  is the Hereford Mappa Mundi, a medieval map of the world plotted in the 1300s and even pinpointing the Garden of Eden. The map is on vellum (calf skin parchment) and at 158 cm by 133, it&#8217;s the largest document of its kind in the world. See the Old House, a Jacobean timber-framed house constructed in 1621 and with a museum about Jacobean Hereford inside. You could also check out the Victorian machinery at the riverside Waterworks, and get acquainted with a county speciality at the Hereford Cider Museum. "
"Ralph Court Gardens, Bromyard","A compact market town, Bromyard has many of the things we all adore about rural England: There are lots of flat-fronted or timber-framed houses, particularly on the crescent-shaped Broad Street with its old inns or twee country shops selling a bit of everything. The main draw in these parts is Ralph Court Gardens a dreamy patchwork of 12 international gardens in the grounds of a Gothic rectory. There&#8217;s certainly a strong community spirit in Bromyard, as you&#8217;ll realise from the many festivals organised by volunteers in the summer. There&#8217;s one for marmalade, town criers, jazz and even scarecrows. But the largest is the folk festival in September, a three-day showcase for traditional English music. "
"Church Lane, Ledbury","A town with heaps of lovable timber architecture, Ledbury still holds two markets a week at its 17th-century Market Hall. This was put together in 1653 by none other than John Abel, who was dubbed the King&#8217;s Carpenter. To appreciate Ledbury&#8217;s timelessness, saunter along the High Street or Church Lane, where the old buildings press in from the sides of a cobblestone alley. On this street is the 16th-century Painted Room, inside the council&#8217;s offices and with frescos dating to the late-1500s. The town library is in a 500-year-old building known as the Master&#8217;s House, while the Heritage Centre is also in a handsome corbelled house from Tudor times. "
Ross-on-Wye,"On the River Wye and at the southern entrance to the county, this handsome market town has been attracting tourists for more than 250 years. The word &#8220;picturesque&#8221; was literally coined by the author William Gilpin to describe the valleys, village and historic ruins in this part of England. The centre of Ross-on-Wye is strewn with eccentric independent shops selling antiques, tea accoutrements and all sorts of cute household items. A short way downriver on the Wye is Goodrich Castle, constructed by the ruins in the 12th century but left as an evocative ruin after it was successfully besieged by the Roundheads in 1646. William Wordsworth described this as the &#8220;noblest ruin in Herefordshire&#8221;. "
"Grange Hall, Leominster","To get the best out of Leominster all you need is your feet. There&#8217;s an array of beautiful half-timbered buildings to appreciate in this town. The best of these may be the Grange Hall, Leominster&#8217;s former market hall, which was also designed by John Abel and has just come through a sensitive restoration. Get up close to the beams at the front to see the 17th-century carvings. Leominster Priory survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries mostly undamaged and warrants a peek for its medieval ducking stool that was once used to punish &#8220;disorderly women&#8221; by dunking them in ponds or rivers! There&#8217;s also no shortage of inspiration for excursions, as the stunning country estates Hampton Court, Berrington Hall and Croft Castle all welcome visitors in the summer. "
"Offa&#8217;s Dyke Path, Kington","Minutes from Welsh soil, Kington is a town knitted into an uplifting and verdant landscape of tall hills. If you&#8217;re planning a walking holiday in Herefordshire this town merits a look as it links with five long-distance trails, including the epic Offa&#8217;s Dyke Path that spans almost the entirety of the Wales-England border. You might have something more sedate in mind, in which case Hergest Croft Garden is a restful English country garden that has been a century in the making. And if you&#8217;re visiting with little ones, you can bring them to feed and bond with  new little pals, at the Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre. "
Golden Valley,"This is the name given to the valley of the River Dore, which weaves through bucolic countryside east of Wales&#8217; Black Mountains. This  scenery is believed to have inspired the author C.S. Lewis, who visited while writing the Chronicles of Narnia. There are four sweet old villages  to tick off, a couple with riveting vestiges from the distant past to keep  you around a bit longer. Dore Abbey became a parish church after Henry VIII suppressed the monasteries in the 16th century and has architecture and fittings remaining that have been here since the 1100s and 1200s. Outside Dorstone is Arthur&#8217;s Stone, a 5,000-year-old Neolithic dolmen, named after the Arthurian legend of long ago. "
Pembridge,"The Black and White Village Trail in Herefordshire is a 40-mile route taking in the county&#8217;s most endearing timber-framed settlements. Pembridge is an unmissable stop on the trail and looks almost like Victorian times, let alone the 20th century, never happened here. There are two almshouses, and all along East Street for instance are pleasingly irregular houses that mostly go back to the 1500s. If you have time to spare, the Church of St Mary is Grade I listed, and dates mostly to the mid-1300s. Some of the interior fittings are newer, but still historic, like the lectern and pulpit, which are both from the 1600s. "
Symonds Yat Rock,"In the Wye Valley area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the village of Symonds Yat is adventure central for people planning outdoor escapades in this spectacular part of the county. The Wye is what many come for, to kayak, canoe or paddle-board on the river, which boils with man-made grade-2 rapids at one spot. The riverside is very scenic, as the water has hewn sheer limestone walls like Symonds Yat Rock. So on land this topography gets a thumbs up from rock climbers, while peregrine falcons and buzzards often nest in the small pockets in the limestone. As for the village, it&#8217;s an adorable little community zig-zagging up the steep west bank of the Wye. There are a clutch of inns in the village, and family attractions close by like the Wye Valley Butterfly Zoo. "
Hay-on-Wye,"This town straddles the border with Wales in the southwest of Herefordshire and is the last Welsh settlement on the Wye just before it arrives in England. If you you&#8217;re a bookworm Hay will be your kind of place as there are more than 20 bookshops in this lovely old town. Many of these sell first editions, antique books and specialist titles that people travel a long way to get hold of. Casual readers can pass a happy afternoon hopping from one shop to the next and browsing to their hearts&#8217; content. "
"Cathedral, St Albans","Known as Verulamium to the Romans, St Albans was the second city in Britain after London 2,000 years ago. And today this market town has its share of ancient sites and artefacts. Go straight to Verulamium Park, where traces of a spa were excavated in the 1930s, revealing a wondrous mosaic and hypocaust. Just by the park is the Verulamium Museum, with yet more mosaics and display cases full of coins, ceramics and even a soldier&#8217;s helmet and mask discovered in the theatre, which makes up the museum&#8217;s exterior. Elsewhere, contemplate the 15th-century clock tower, a logo for St Albans, and unusual in England for being a belfry unattached to any church. "
"Natural History Museum, Tring","Slotted into a gap in the Chilterns is the sweet little market town of Tring, which has gorgeous 19th-century architecture and a branch of the Natural History Museum. Lionel Walter Rothschild is the man responsible for this, as he was obsessed with zoology, and even rode around the town in a carriage drawn by zebra-horse hybrids. So now, in a delightful Victorian hall that he built for his many taxidermies there&#8217;s a creepy if informative assortment of mounted stuffed animals, among them extinct species like thylacines and quaggas. Ending at the marvellous Ivinghoe Beacon hill a couple of miles from Tring is the Ridgeway National Trail, which follows the Celtic Icknield Way from Avebury in Wiltshire over the North Wessex Downs and the Chilterns. "
Hatfield House,"If you&#8217;re a student of Elizabeth I Hatfield House will be a treasure trove as it has a variety of things that are connected to the queen. Although the building was altered in the century that followed, Hatfield House was where Elizabeth spent a lot of her childhood and it was her preferred residence as an adult. There are gloves and silk stockings belonging to her, as well as the original of the famed Rainbow Portrait from the turn of the 17th century. Another British icon tied to Hatfield is the defunct de Havilland aircraft manufacturer, which was based here for much of its life. Ten minutes in the car and you&#8217;ll be at the great De Havilland Museum at London Colney, with some of the earliest jet planes ever made. "
Welwyn Garden City,"The city planner Sir Ebenezer Howard developed his utopian idea of a Garden City in the early-20th century, as a town with good transport links to London but all the peace and greenery of the countryside. And nearly a century after Welwyn Garden City was completed it&#8217;s still a very liveable place. If you&#8217;re into things like town planning and urban design you could entertain yourself just by poking around for a couple of hours or taking some time out by the water at Stanborough Park. "
Hitchin Town Square,"Towards the north of Hertfordshire, Hitchin is a delightful town, made to be seen on foot. Especially pretty are the cobblestone streets around Market Place, hemmed by characterful old houses and St Mary&#8217;s Church. This building is an archetypal Wool Church, built too large for what would have been a small-ish town in the middle ages, but funded by wealthy wool merchants. St Mary&#8217;s was built over a 7th-century basilica from the earliest days of Christianity in England. Come around July and August, when the undulating lavender fields outside the town are at their most vibrant. Hitchin Lavender is a farm that lets you pick your own for a small fee, and also sells a range of giftable fragrant soaps and candles in its shop. "
Letchworth,"As the world&#8217;s first garden city, no building you see in the centre of Letchworth is older than the 20th century. You may be fooled by the historical design of much of the architecture, which owes its appearance to the Arts and Crafts Movement. Like Welwyn, Letchworth is an Ebenezer Howard-designed, pre-planned town with lots of green space, easy access to the countryside and industry kept apart from residential areas. A perfect expression of the Arts and Crafts style can be seen at the Spirella Building, a listed former factory for a corset-maker, which, true to the spirit of the town, provided its workers with a library, gymnasium, baths and even a cycle repair centre. "
Gatehouse to Hertford Castle,"Hertfordshire&#8217;s county town is modest in size but brims with history, and there&#8217;s a few low-key sights to tick off on a saunter around these old streets. The Grade I-listed Shire Hall is a magistrates&#8217; court built in 1789 and conceived by Robert Adam, who was one of the era&#8217;s foremost architects, active across Britain. The marvellous gothic house at Hertford Castle replaced a Norman fortress in 15th century and was a childhood home for Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century. You can dip into the tales behind these buildings at Hertford Museum, which itself is set in a 17th-century house. The first floor dedicated to the town, while the remainder of the museum has anything from samurai armour to fossils. "
Berkhamsted Castle Cottage,"The history of Berkhamsted begins in the very year of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Not only that, but William the Conqueror&#8217;s  half-brother Robert of Mortain was most likely responsible for building Berkhamsted Castle, and most definitely lived there in the 11th century. The castle is now an atmospheric ruin, and with intact earthworks and large chunks of the curtain walls still standing, it&#8217;s easy to see where the keep would have been. On sunny days the green towpath of the Grand Junction Canal is ideal for a reflective stroll by the water. "
Cassiobury Park,"Visually-speaking, Watford might not be as prepossessing as Hertfordshire&#8217;s more rural towns and villages. But all the same, it&#8217;s a clean and well-off town with a few things to keep you occupied. The placid Cassiobury Park was once the grounds of a country estate, and is now a sizeable nature reserve a brief jaunt from the town centre. There are two country houses to visit nearby, one of which, Bhaktivedanta Manor is a half-timbered Tudor building converted into a Gaudiya Vaishnavism temple. A tad more conventional is Cheslyn House and Gardens,  a haven of peace with gardens that are a riot of colour in spring. Watford also have a Premier League football side, nicknamed the Hornets and playing home games at Vicarage Road from August to May. "
Knebworth House,"Another one for the urban planning historians, Stevenage was England&#8217;s first &#8220;New Town&#8221;, laid out in a matter of a years after the Second World War. The population exploded from just a few thousand at the start of the 1900s to more than 80,000 today. The old town is still intact, with the pubs and half-timbered houses on its typical country high street, and the Church of St Nicholas which dates to the 12th century. Pop historians on the other hand will have heard all about Knebworth House, where bands like Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin have played to enormous crowds. The gothic-revival house and grounds are open to the public, and there&#8217;s a dinosaur park for kids in the park&#8217;s woodland. "
Bishop&#8217;s Stortford,"Convenient to Stansted Airport without being too close, Bishop&#8217;s Stortford is a quintessential country market town dominated by a neoclassical late-18th-century Corn Exchange. Friday and Saturday evenings in the summer are a fine time to be in the town, when its residents who work in London are back in the town and filling the pubs and restaurants. Right up against the centre of the town is a park containing the unmistakeable earthworks for a Norman fortress. At the top of this mound are the ruins of Waytemore Castle dating to the 1100s, which later became a prison but was torn down in the 1700s. "
Royston,"There&#8217;s a man-made cave directly beneath the centre of this town at the very north of Hertfordshire. Royston Cave may not be well-known but if you&#8217;re in the area you have to check in for a tour. This eight-metre-high chamber has eerie carvings on its walls, which are most likely from the late-medieval period. The cave was sealed up and rediscovered in 1742, and despite being studied for more than 250 years nobody has put a definite date to these sculptures. The Icknield Way that passes through Tring continues on to Norfolk, and comes right by Royston. You needn&#8217;t go that far, but for an hour or two you can navigate the local chalk hills on a path beaten by pre-Roman tribes. "
Ware,"One of the many great things about Ware is the River Lea. The banks are adorably quaint and picturesque, thanks to the old buildings on the waters&#8217; edge. These include former &#8220;maltings&#8221;, which were part of the beer-brewing process, where grains would be soaked in the river&#8217;s water to produce malt. You&#8217;ll also find twee old gazebos, with tiny wharfs where boats can be moored. An astounding monument in Ware is Scott&#8217;s Grotto, fashioned by a John Scott a gardener, and Quake port: This building is partially dug into the hillside, with six different chambers, each with walls covered with glass, fossils and glass. The structure is from the 18th century and we&#8217;re sure you won&#8217;t have seen anything like it! "
Much Hadham,"A famous former resident of Much Hadham is the 20th-century sculptor Henry Moore. His old house is the site of the Henry Moore Foundation, and a unique chance to see many of his works on show in one place. Though not blessed with shops, the parish village of Much Hadham is chock full of imposing old buildings, partly because it was also a stopping point on the road between Cambridge and London. In this one place there are four Grade I-listed buildings, including two spectacular Georgian country houses. After hot-footing it around the village you could drop by at the Old Bull Inn for a pint or meal. "
Wheathampstead,"For the traditional pleasures of an English country town, Wheathampstead on the River Lea merits a detour for a pub lunch and a wander. There are Georgian townhouses and older wattle and daub buildings on the high street, and the leafy banks of the Lea are exceptionally pretty, with benches where you can pause for a minute or two. The attractions in and near Wheathampstead are all quite modest, but it&#8217;s the scene and ambience of the place that makes it worthwhile. Nomansland Common is just southwest of the town and in old times it was a venue for banned sports like bare-knuckle boxing, set away from the reach of the authorities. "
Lake Balaton,"Running for a whopping 77 kilometers through the undulating hills that form the verdant reaches of western Hungary, Lake Balaton is a magnet for both domestic and foreign visitors both summer and winter. Along its wide, grassy banks, sunbathers settle from May onwards, many clutching beers and boogieing the afternoons away outside beach bars in party towns like Keszthely and Siofok (now hailed as the Ibiza of Hungary!). Others come to dive into the mineral-rich volcanic waters of the lake itself, which is eminently swimmable and great for sailing and other watersports. Camping and cottage resorts pepper the shorelines too, while castles and interesting churches crown the hills of Balatonalmadi and Szigliget. "
Pecs,"The multicultural gem of south-western Hungary, Pecs can be found neatly nestled close to all of Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. 2,000 years of history going all the way back to Roman times imbue the centre with layer upon layer of heritage and cultural interest, while the backdrop of the forest-clad Mecsek Hills offers outdoorsy types oodles of hiking and mountain biking on the edge of the Dinaric Alps. Back in the town centre and a lively student population powers the bars, all of which coalesce invitingly between the cobbled streets, below the charming Rococo-come-Renaissance Cathedral, amidst the curiously Turkic facades and the around the pretty blue-domed tops of the Mosque of Pasha Quasim. "
Esztergom,"Straddling a picturesque bend in the Danube as it weaves its way along the southern border of Slovakia, the cathedral-topped town of Esztergom has long been hailed as the veritable nerve centre of Christianity in Hungary. From around the 10th century, the city was also the capital of the Hungarian Kingdom, and played host to revered Magyar monarchs like the pious Saint Stephen. Today, it’s visited mainly for its sprawling religious constructions, which find their zenith in the huge Esztergom Basilica, which comes complete with gloomy crypts and cupolas. And around this stony church-citadel is the Watertown district; a pretty maze of cobblestone where Baroque and Classical faces abut babbling fountains and sun-splashed squares. "
Debrecen,"Oft-overlooked and unexplored by tourists making their way through Hungary, Debrecen is actually a surprising cocktail of history, culture and heritage. It’s hailed as the capital of the Great Hungarian Plain; known for its isolated place on the rolling steppe and vast agricultural land of the east. In the Middle Ages it rose to prominence as a frontier fort against the Mongol Hordes, then as a hotspot for Magyar Calvinists. In the 19th century, the city boomed as the temporary capital of the nation as a whole, imbuing the downtown area with its charming neoclassical facades, bolstering the collections of the great Deri Museum (a must) and expanding the boundaries of the sprawling Nagyerdo city park. "
Szentendre,"Draped over the Danube banks just a little jaunt north out of the capital of Budapest, tight-knit, fairy-tale Szentendre rises in a symphony of stone-clad streets and age-old Magyar houses. Something of a museum-piece of an old town, the place was overlooked entirely by the invading Ottomans, but boomed again in later centuries with Serbian and Mediterranean settlers, who each brought their elegant Baroque and Balkan styles to bear on the centre. Today, travelers head here to weave between the many independent galleries (the spot has become something of a magnet for up-and-coming artists), wander below the bulbous church domes and shop in the multitude of interesting little boutiques. "
Tihany,"Poking its way elegantly out over the sky-blue waters of Lake Balaton, the peninsula town of Tihany has been known as one of Hungary’s most romantic retreats for decades. It comes decorated with the white walls and spires of the Tihany Abbey &#8211; a 1,000-year-old monastery that’s been both a Benedictine worshipping house and erstwhile prison for Habsburg emperors over the centuries. Around this rises one chocolate box of an old town, where paprika stalls dot the streets, independent galleries offer Magyar crafts and the bobbing yachts in the docks beckon visitors to the volcanic waters of Balaton itself. "
Tokaj,"Encompassed on all sides by the cascading fields of vineyards that form the famed Tokaj wine region of eastern Hungary, this small and charming town has risen to become a taster’s dream. Amidst its sun-splashed cobbled lanes and Baroque-styled boulevards, travelers here enjoy oodles of cellar doors and wineries, where it’s possible to sample the iconic Furmint, Harslevelu, and Tokay dry and sweet wine varieties that helped to put the Tokaj area on the viniculture map. But it’s not just about the bottle here, because Tokaj town also hosts enchanting taverns that serve up famous fish broths, winding walking routes along the River Tisza and the heights of Bald Mountain to boot. "
Sopron,"Old, aged and weathered by political storms aplenty, Sopron pokes its way into the flatlands of eastern Austria on the border-straddling banks of Lake Ferto (that’s Lake Neusiedl if you’re Austrian!). Over more than 2,000 years of settlement here, the town has garnered a charming medieval veneer. Its Germanic church spires loom high over the cobbled central square, the dominating Firewatch Tower shimmers a bronze-green hue, Roman ruins rise ad hoc on the streets and remnants of a 16th-century Jewish boom linger on. Oh, and there’s wine too, with the city’s cellar doors touting some of the best Austrian-style Gewurztraminer going! "
Visegrad,"The great bulwark of the Magyar Danube and the onetime palatial home of the revered Slavic King Matthias Corvinus, Visegrad soars above the river bends on the edge of Slovakia to form one of Hungary’s most dramatic and unforgettable historic sights. Clad in medieval stone and surrounded by the ruins of an ancient Roman military camp, the spot oozes with interest for the history buff. On the top of the hill stands the mighty Upper Castle of Bela IV, constructed originally to fend off the Mongol Hordes and later a stronghold of the incumbent Ottomans. Below that is the Lower Castle, where the striking hexagonal keep of the Solomon Tower and oodles of masterful gothic architecture meet, along with the seemingly endless collections of the King Matthias Museum. "
Budapest,"A city that really needs no introduction, Budapest continues to reign supreme as one of the great touristic magnets of Central-Eastern Europe. Crowned by the elegant and sprawling mastery of Buda Castle and cut through by the winding S-bends of the Danube, the town is at once mysterious and lively, packed with history and indelibly modern at every turn. Erudite students hit the lecture halls here by day and descend into sleepless dive bars by night, speakeasies erupt on the corners of Pest while the City Park hosts everything from bikers to castle-seekers. Meanwhile, the House of Terror shocks and the National Museum wows, the parliament building stands proud and Fisherman’s Bastion has sunset views to die for! And then there are the baths, bubbling and steaming from Art Deco Szechenyi to elaborate Kiraly. "
Koszeg,"Once the seat of the great dynasties of Transdanubia and later a fiefdom of the Anjou kings, Koszeg has its roots way back in the 13th century. Over more than seven hundred years it has gained one of the most attractive historical appearances in the country, boasting the likes of Koszeg Castle (once an important point of contact between the Magyars and their Ottoman invaders) and an enchanting, pop-up book of a centre that’s been left all but untouched since the late Middle Ages. What’s more, the hills around the city offer fine and accessible walking routes, many of which cross over into the Alpine foothills of east Austria. "
Lake Heviz,"Joined at the hip to the aforementioned Lake Balaton, Heviz seems a world apart from the hedonistic party towns that line its counterpart’s southern shore. Yes sir, hailed as one of the largest thermal lakes in the world, the tepid waters here play host to a kaleidoscopic array of algae and cyanobacteria that have helped to build Heviz’s reputation as a holistic healing spot. Today, the place is primarily known as the home of the Heviz Spa, which rises in the midst of the lake and draws everyone from medical tourists (the treatments are thought to be particularly helpful to people suffering rheumatic complaints) to relaxation seekers throughout the year. "
Aggtelek,"Running deep under the hills of Gomor-Torna and continuous with the great Slovak Karst across the border, the UNESCO-attested cave systems of Aggtelek are surely one of Hungary’s most fascinating natural draws. The jewel in the crown here is the Baradla Cave, which bursts with whitewashed stalactites and evidence of human habitation going back almost seven millennia on the outskirts of the rustic village of Josvafo. Other attractions include the colourful caverns and tunnels of the Imre Vass Cave, whose rocky walls oscillate between iron-rust orange and shimmering turquoise. Walking and hiking routes also abound on the surface, and can take visitors across into Slovakia. "
Eger,"Crafted and cultivated by everyone from Saint Stephen to the Magyar Kings to Matthias Corvinus to the Turkish Ottomans to the Austrian Habsburgs, Eger’s veritable hodgepodge of Islamic minarets (the northernmost one in Europe no less) and sprawling medieval fortresses is a real treasure to behold. The town can be found in the north-eastern reaches of the country, bursting with bubbling thermal baths and countless wineries touting the legendary labelled produce of the Tokaj region. The old part of town is what draws most visitors; a web of winding alleys and cobbled squares that hides cafes and Hungarian taverns by the bucket load. Nice. "
Holloko,"One of Hungary’s best-preserved cultural landscapes, Holloko bears a UNESCO tag for its seamless integration with the undulating ridges of the Cserhat Mountains that surround it. Made up of ruins and builds dating from the 13th century onwards, the spot was once the home of the Paloc tribespeople of northern Hungary. Later, the place became a bulwark against the Mongols and then was deserted after the Ottomans left in to the 16th century. It was after this tumultuous past that the present settlement rose. Untouched since, Holloko is now considered a picture-perfect example of historic and bucolic life in Central Europe. "
The Blue Lagoon,"Bubbling and steaming between the rocky promontories of the Reykjanes Peninsula some 40 kilometers from the island’s capital at Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon hails in as one of Iceland’s most visited tourist attractions. Despite its volcanic nature, the site is actually very young; formed from the leftover plugholes of a geothermal power plant in the 1970s. Still, the location amidst the ridges around Grindavik is truly enchanting, while the waters come packed with minerals – the reason for the shimmering, whitish hue of the lagoon and the driving force behind the spot’s famed healing powers. Visitors to the lagoon can also enjoy in-water massages, guided tours of the curious geothermal area and luxury lounge facilities besides. "
Gullfoss Waterfall,"Visitors will find the majestic Gullfoss Waterfall roaring over the escarpments and bluffs of south-western Iceland. It’s famed as one of the most dramatic cataracts in the world, and cascades over a series of stepped rocks and terraces before plunging over the 32-meter high crevice that gives the fall its distinct appearance of disappearing into the Icelandic subterrane. The falls themselves can often be found arched over by rainbows or shrouded in plumes of mist, while by summer, the surrounding hills and ridges come dressed in a verdant covering of grass that makes a fine backdrop for hiking around the banks of the Hvita River. "
Grundarfjordur,"The small and sleepy fishing town of Grundarfjordur makes its home on the ice-caked edge of the Snaefellsnes Peninsula, where some of West Iceland’s most curious coastal formations edge their way up to the waters of the Greenland Sea. And while hiking and cliff trekking abounds in the surrounding national park and Grundarfjordur itself is known for its earthy summer folk festivals courtesy of the local Viking Foundation, the town is unquestionably most famed as the jump off point for seeing (and photographing for most) the striking profile of Mount Kirkjufell, which lurches like a rocky shark fin amidst the waterfalls and coves of Snaefellsnes. "
Myrdalsjokull Glacier,"Caked in ice all year round, the soaring ridges of the mighty Katla caldera play host to Iceland’s wild and arctic Myrdalsjokull Glacier Park. This snow-packed field encompasses hundreds of square kilometers and represents the fourth-largest of its kind in the country. It’s known for its otherworldly appearance, as verdant peaks poke their way out above the ice-carved valleys, metamorphic creations crowd above the crevasses and quick sand pools lurk on the edges of Solheimajokul – one of the most striking offshoots of the Myrdalsjokull Glacier. Guided hiking is uber-popular here, with spots like the Fimmvorduhals pass and the ridges of Eyjafjallajokull both offering daring getaways. "
Landmannalaugar,"A deep-cut valley set in the very midst of south-western Iceland’s famous Fjallabak Nature Reserve, the Landmannalaugar is a hidden gem of a destination that comes complete with everything from bubbling volcanic hot springs to ochre-coloured mountain ridges. Hiking trails surround the entire region, while a campsite right in the middle of the Landmannalaugar and a separate mountain hut offer outdoorsy types the base point they need for hitting the famous Laugavegur trail. The piece de resistance of the area has to be the Brennisteinsalda peak though; a medley of obsidian lava sheets and iron-coloured, sulphur-spotted ridges which is viewable from the trail. "
Reykjavik,"At once sophisticated and quirky, hedonistic and happening, Reykjavik packs one hefty punch for the northernmost capital city on the planet. Its charming downtown of painted timber homes is watched over by the soaring and unforgettable needle-like spire of the Hallgrimskirkja – now a veritable icon of the Icelandic city – while oodles of hearty Scandinavian vodka bars and taverns coalesce between the streets. Nearby, the beautiful Tjornin pool adds an aquatic edge to the town, while the Alpingi parliament building oozes 19th-century charm and the centre pulses with the likes of the National Gallery of Iceland, the Hafnarhus and the fascinating ancient ruins of the 871±2. In short, this one’s not to be missed! "
Vatnajokull National Park,"Crowned by the seemingly endless ice fields of its eponymous glacier (the largest on the continent outside of the Arctic Circle), the Vatnajokull National Park makes its home over more than 13,000 square kilometers of south-east and central Iceland. The area is famed for the great variation in landscapes, rolling from the flower-packed meadows and roaring waterfalls (don’t miss the famous Dettifoss Fall!) that run through the Skaftafell lowlands (where there are also camping sites aplenty by summer) to the windswept, crevasse-cut glacial fields on the mountaintops. The wetlands here play host to roaming reindeer, while mighty Hvannadalshnukur (the country’s highest point) stands high and the rugged interior of the Eldgja canyon showcases some truly wondrous volcanic geology – there’s loads to see! "
Borgarnes,"Borgarnes may just look like a small dash of whitewashed timber in its position sandwiched between the coastal plains, the rising peaks of the Hafnarfjall massif and the waters of the Borgarfjordur a little north out of Reykjavik. But this humble fishing town on the edge of the sea actually has mythic roots, in the pages of the Egils Saga, and later the spot became the commercial trading centre for all of west Iceland. That means travelers can expect an array of shopping opportunities and the likes of the Settlement Centre Museum, which chronicles the earliest days of Borgarnes, all alongside the more obvious draws of the surroundings: coastal hiking; whale spotting; those indelible hot springs! "
Asbyrgi Canyon,"Carving its way out of the rocky inland of north-east Iceland, the chiselled gorges and ridges of Asbyrgi rarely fail to draw a gasp. In all, the sheer-sided edges of the canyon run for more than three kilometers and come in at a whopping 100 meters in height at some points. Hiking trails can be found piercing deep into the river-carved, glacial valley, weaving past tussock meadows, willow and birch groves and the ancient features of Ice Age cliffs. The spot is also shrouded in Norse legend; thought to have been created by the footfall of Odin’s mythic horse, Sleipnir. "
Skalholt,"Off-the-beaten-track and often overlooked for the southern region’s bigger pulls – the Gullfoss Waterfall and the Golden Circle – Skalholt can be found sat on the rolling fields just on the edge of the Hvita River. Believe it or not, this small, snow-dusted centre in the wilds was actually one of the most powerful and important spots in the country from the 11th century onwards, and came to be hailed as the epicentre of Icelandic Catholicism. Today, the town is crowned by the oversized Skalholt Cathedral, which was virtually entirely rebuilt in the 1900s, complete with elegant Danish stained-glass pieces. "
Akureyri,"The self-proclaimed capital of North Iceland can come as a real surprise. Despite its humble 18,000 people, this fishing port and seaside gem of a city on the edges of the Eyjafjordur makes some serious waves. Its centre is packed to the brim with interesting independent cafes and teahouses, while the Hafnarstraeti shopping street offers up countless boutiques and craft stores. Meanwhile, the twin spires of Akureyri Church mimic the snow-mantled summits that shroud the town on all sides, and the local craze for mayo-doused, chip-packed hamburger buns has now become a legend in its own right. Yes sir, Akureyri really is worth the visit! "
The Westfjords,"Jagged and jutting like fingers of rock and stone into the icy rollers of the Greenland Sea, the various tendrils of the Westfjords peninsula are surely amongst the most startling and worthy natural wonders in all of Iceland. A walker’s paradise, they come complete with spots like the Hornstrandir reserve, with its Arctic foxes and seal pods, and the Latrabjarg (Europe’s westernmost point if you don’t count the Azores). Then there is gloriously-set Isafjordur, found clinging to a spit of sand on the edge of the ocean and boasting a history going all the way back to the 9th century! Sea kayaking, cliff walking and hitting the shimmering sands of Raudasandur are also all favourites. "
Lake Myvatn,"Situated just east out of the so-called northern capital of Akureyri, Lake Myvatn offers up a truly otherworldly landscape that ranges from craggy craters to curious volcanic plug holes to bubbling mud pools and oodles more. It’s thought the lake popped into existence following a volcanic eruption more than two millennia ago, and today it’s much-loved by bird watchers, hikers and adventure seekers alike. Top attractions in the area include the Namaskard mud pools, the black lava monoliths of Dimmuborgir, hike-able Vindbelgjarfjall at just over 500 meters above sea level and the sulphuric Myvatn Nature Baths (great if you don’t want the crowds of the Blue Lagoon!). "
Thingvellir National Park,"A symphony of volcanic ridges and continental cracks, carved canyons and the flowing cataracts of the mighty Oxara River, the Thingvellir National Park is arguably the most beautiful natural enclave in all of Iceland. Not only is it easily accessible from Reykjavik, but also comes complete with totemic sites like the Silfra fissure and the Peningagja pool, a rift lake that glimmers with coins dating back more than 100 years. Thingvellir is also a hiker’s dream-come-true, boasting rugged cliff walks and mountain climbs, while history and culture buffs will love uncovering the remains of the country’s first Viking age parliament – established here in 930. "
Hofn,"Boasting a truly dramatic location on the small islets and finger-like peninsulas that linger in the Atlantic waters off the Hornafjordur, little Hofn is a prime example of a southern Icelandic fishing town. As one of the favoured gateways to the wilds of East Iceland and the Vatnajokull National Park, the spot is a great choice for travelers eager to delve into some of the country’s top bucket-list natural sights, while a folk museum, the Ice Land Glacier Exhibition and arguably the best lobster eateries in all of Europe make lingering here for a day or two a fantastic way to get a feel for the rustic, salt-washed vibe of the seafaring locals. "
Stanley,"With less than a hundred residents, Stanley is one of Idaho’s smallest yet most beautiful towns. Stanley is surrounded by snowcapped mountains and a must-visit small town for adventurers. You can sleep at a cozy hotel or camp in the wilderness and use Stanley as a base to hike, climb, river raft, horseback ride, soak in hot springs, mountain bike, and explore the surrounding forests. Because of its friendly community, many people who visit never want to leave. "
Salmon,"Salmon is a town clinging to an old wild west identity without the roughness. The western themed architecture and untouched surroundings might just make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time, especially if you’re a city slicker. You’ll have to venture over unpopulated and rugged terrain to arrive here if you come by car, but it’s worth it. Salmon is a great base for outdoorsmen, white water rafting, and is next to the Frank Church River of the No Return Wilderness Area. If you visit during winter, spend the days on the ski slopes, tucked into wooden cabins, and tasting comfort food at the town’s many restaurants. "
Sandpoint,"Sandpoint is no stranger to top ten lists featuring Idaho’s best places. This stunning small town is on the shores Lake Pend Oreille and bordered by the Selkirk and Cabinet mountains. It’s worth visiting Sandpoint at any time of the year. When it’s warm, visitors can go standup paddling, fishing, swimming, and boating on Lake Pend Oreille. Once the snow comes, ski, sled, and snowboard at Schweitzer Mountain. The town is known for attracting all types of creatives like writers, painters, sculptors, and performers who use the region as a muse for their work. As a result, Sandpoint has a thriving cultural and arts scene that has events on all-year-round for visitors to enjoy. "
Priest River,"Priest River exists where two rivers meet just seven miles south of the Canadian border. The town used to house one of the region’s timber companies, which is why you should visit during the Timber Day Festival and stop at the Timber Education Center. During winter, it’s a great base for skiing at Schweitzer Mountain and snowshoeing along the river beds. Summer rarely gets too hot so visitors can enjoy life on the water and go boating, swimming, fishing, camping, hiking, rafting, mountain biking, and so much more. "
Wallace,"Wallace was once an old mining town that brought silver into the American West’s economy. The lure of this precious metal had people migrating over to Idaho in hopes of striking it rich. Today, silver is still mined in Wallace and visitors can come see how it works at the Sierra Silver Mine, where a retired miner leads visitors of all ages through an underground silver mine and trolley ride. Wallace is a well-rounded town also offering delicious dining options, plenty of cultural events, and is just steps away from all types of outdoor recreation. It’s a unique small town that is sure to stand out from everywhere else in Idaho. "
Preston,"Before the hit movie “Napoleon Dynamite,” Preston was an unknown blip on a map to most of America – and the rest of the world. But when Preston resident Jared Hess showcased Preston as being a quirky, lovable, and fun small town, fans came running. The town took advantage by being the premier site to sell “Vote for Pedro” shirts, tater tots, and chapstick. Today, Napoleon’s legacy has worn off slightly but Preston has managed to retain its feel-good atmosphere. Even if you’re not a fan of the quirky film, you should stop to enjoy the nearby natural parks like the Glendale Reservoir and other lakes. "
McCall,"On the shores of Payette Lake, McCall is a peaceful small town amidst dense forests. It prides itself on being safe, fun, friendly, and beautiful – and so far, nobody has yet to contend with these descriptors. During the winter months, McCall hosts the Winter Carnival where people from all over the state come to enjoy the ice sculpture displays, games, live entertainment, and ski or snowboard at nearby Brundage Mountain Resort. Once the warm weather kicks in, McCall is known for its pleasant temperatures and sunshine making it the perfect place to go hiking, water skiing, horseback riding, and do other outdoor activities. McCall has a wide variety of accommodation and dining options as well. "
Hailey,"Hailey started as a pioneer colony, where settlers had to create a community that could survive snowy winters. Based in the northern end of the Rocky Mountain Range, Hailey is a touch point for outdoor recreation, water sports, and snow skiing. Autumn is one of the most beautiful months when fire engine-red leaves fall and line the streets. The residents of Hailey love to celebrate, so there’s a strong chance you’ll be visiting during one of the many festivals. Some town favorites are the Trailing of the Sheep Festival, the Northern Rockies Music Festival, Crosstober Bike Race and Beerfest, the Sun Valley Film Festival, and the Independence Day Rodeo. This is all in addition to local performances and smaller events that take place all year round. The town frequently draws artists of all types who leave a cultural mark on Hailey whenever they visit. "
Hope,"Though Hope has less than one hundred residents, it has more personality than many towns ten times its size. Ask locals to point you in the direction of “Beyond Hope,” and they’ll lead you to a nature reserve filled with whitetail deer and flocks of geese. It’s not uncommon to see a Bald Eagle in the region as well. Camp on the Sam Owen Campground to completely immerse yourself in the beautiful nature. Totally serene, Hope is where you go to truly get away from any stress that exists in your everyday life. You can easily spend the day relaxing by Lake Pend Oreille, taking a water taxi tour, swimming, and hiking. And when you do want to go back to a bit of bustle, Hope is just a few minutes away from Sandpoint, another top small town that’s more catered to tourists. "
Island Park,"If you’re going to Yellowstone National Park, you can’t miss stopping and enjoying some time in Island Park. This small town is a paradise for outdoor-addicts of all types – there’s fishing, hiking, camping, hiking, snow sports, and so much more all within a short distance. If you’re not the camping type, Island Park has tens of wooden lodges that make for the perfect cozy retreat after a long day out exploring. The town also has the longest main street in America, lined with fun and quirky shops to explore. Best of all, you’ll be away from the bulk of the Yellowstone crowd if you stay in Island Park yet still just a short drive away. "
Garden Valley,"Garden Valley is a small town that’s as peaceful as its name suggests. It’s the right destination for thrill seekers who still want a place to opt out of the adrenaline and relax. The typical itinerary here is centered around going out and exploring, then rejuvenating at one of the hot springs or resorts. During winter, head to the Idaho X-Sports Adventure Park for extreme tubing and heart-pumping snow themed adventures or go for a sleigh ride. In summer, there’s the Idaho Whitewater Unlimited tour, where you’ll be getting soaked while rafting down the Payette River and horseback riding trail rides through the forest. Locals can usually be found hanging around the Starlight Mountain Theatre, a venue with live performances, or at the Dirty Shame Saloon, a pizza parlor and western style pub. "
Bonners Ferry,"Bonners Ferry is amidst the Kootenai River Valley and surrounded by multiple mountain ranges. If you love history and enjoying a slow-paced lifestyle, then this small town is a must see for you. In town, grab a beer from the local brewery, take a tour of the Fairbanks-Morse Generator Plant, and stop by the Pearl Theatre. There are also a variety of restaurants and antique shops to peruse.

Bird watching and photography are both very popular at the Burden Falls Wilderness, while hunting and fishing are both allowed in the grounds too.

Burden Falls itself is a 20-foot waterfall, but the water descends for a further 80 feet in cascades &#8211; watching the falls is a captivating experience. "
Chicago Harbor Lighthouse,"The Chicago Harbor Lighthouse is one of the most beautiful sights in Chicago. While it can be spotted from the city&#8217;s Navy Pier, a boat tour of the harbor might be the best way to get up close to the lighthouse for a perfect photo opportunity. No access is currently permitted to the lighthouse as it remains a navigational aid to this day. Nearby parks to the lighthouse include Milton Olive Park and Jane Addams Memorial Park and they are both worth exploring during a visit to Illinois too. Lighthouse viewing point Navy Pier itself is Chicago&#8217;s number one tourist attraction. "
Matthiessen State Park,"Matthiessen State Park in central LaSalle County is located close to both Oglesby and Utica. The park is famous for its array of unusual and beautiful rock formations and it also combines forest, streams and prairies in a way few other parks in Illinois can.

An abundance of plant and animal life can be enjoyed in the park, which has a very large white-tail deer population. The park also boasts a number of stunning picnic spots, the best of which is perhaps at Dells Area, which has a children&#8217;s playground to keep the kids entertained. As Matthiessen State Park is located close to the Plum Island Eagle Sanctuary, bald eagles can also sometimes be spotted within the grounds of the park. "

Starved Rock State Park,"The canyons at Starved Rock State Park are one of the top attractions of this beautiful spot. Within its 2,630 acres there are 18 canyons to explore, while visitors can also walk through some 13 miles of trails around the park too.

Waterfall enthusiasts will find plenty to love at the park too, with French, LaSalle, Ottawa and St. Louis Canyons the best places to go to see the falls. The spring is arguably the best time of the year to visit the canyons at Starved Rock State Park, but the wonderful array of colours provided by autumn are well worth checking out too. "
Grosse Pointe Lighthouse,"The beautiful Grosse Point Lighthouse is one of Illinois&#8217; most beautiful buildings, while it is also on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a National Historic Landmark too. The site of the Grosse Point Lighthouse site is also famous for being reputedly where Father Jacques Marquette landed in 1674 when he came to visit Native American tribes, but there is little firm proof of this happening. While the lighthouse grounds are open to the public free of charge year-round, tours are held seasonally due to weather conditions. To get to the top of the tower, visitors must climb the 141 steps to the summit of the lighthouse. "
Chicago Riverwalk,"The Chicago Riverwalk is the idea of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and is set to become one of the most important tourist destinations in the whole of Illinois in the coming years. The heart of the Riverwalk is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Plaza, which commemorates those who have given their lives fighting in wars.  Floating gardens, a bridge and fishing piers are among the additions being made to the Chicago Riverwalk.

With facilities including four fountains and a 30-foot pool, the Leaning Tower of Niles is a must for anyone visiting the village, which hosts the annual open-air Leaning Tower Concert Series in the summer. While Pisa&#8217;s tower is leaning more over the years, the Leaning Tower of Niles is anchored in concrete to keep it steady. In the 1990s, Niles became a sister city to Pisa as a result of the presence of the Leaning Tower. "
Central Illinois,"Away from the busy cities of Rockford and Chicago, exploring Central Illinois is a great way to learn what this state is all about. Consisting mostly of flat prairie, Central Illinois is one of the most peaceful places in the whole country. Man-made lakes such as Lake Shelbyville and Lake Springfield can be found in Central Illinois, which has a number of important historical sites relating to President Abraham Lincoln, such as the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. The superb Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge is well worth a visit for nature lovers. "
"Taj Mahal, Agra, India","Perhaps the world’s greatest symbol of love and opulence, the Taj Mahal is India’s top attraction in Agra. The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to keep the remains of his favorite wife, commonly known as Mumtaz Mahal, or “The Chosen One of the Palace. ” Historians speculate that it took over 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants to build this majestic palace of marble and semi-precious stones. It’s said that the Taj Mahal itself changes color throughout the day, varying from pink hues in the morning to blinding white in the evening. Of course, whether this is true or not is a theory you’ll have to discover yourself. "
The Ghats in Varinassi,"The Ganges River is one of the most sacred places for practicing Hindus in India and is a lifeline for the millions of people who live alongside it, relying on the river for food and water. At 2,500 kilometers long, it’s an impressive sight you can’t miss.

"

Visitors can practice traditional Hatha yoga, or try their hand at new-age crystal healing. In the evening, head down to the banks of the Ganges and witness the ganga aarti, a Hindu fire offering. Almost in contrast, Rishikesh is also a white-water rafting hub and is a popular hub for Himalaya hikes if the down-time is deemed to be too much. "
"Hampi, India","Step back in time in Hampi, a surreal landscape of temples, ruins, and palm groves. This UNESCO World Heritage Site hosts the Virupaksha Temple, an impressive feat of ancient architecture.

"Goa Beach, India","Goa is home to India’s beloved beaches and psychedelic scene. Expect all-night parties on Goa’s north end, transitioning into a more laid-back vibe down south.

Check out the beaches of Palolem, Anjuna, and Madrem for three distinctly different atmospheres that Goa has to offer. "
"Varanasi, India","Varanasi is often touted as India’s spiritual capital because of the thousands of Hindu pilgrims it attracts. Though it’s also known as the City of Life, pilgrims perform funeral ceremonies in the River Ganges, cleansing the deceased in holy water before cremation. The city also has over 2,000 Hindu temples, the most famous being Kashi Vishwanath, an ornate tribute to the god Shiva. Day in and day out, residents celebrate life and honor the dead in this city centered around the meaning of human existence. "
Ladakh,"Escape from the constant buzz of India’s big cities to Ladakh, a sparsely populated region between the Kunlun and Himalayan mountain ranges. Set to the backdrop of jagged mountains are prayer-flag lined Buddhist monasteries, self-sustaining homesteads, and running streams. Between the warm months of June and September, you can camp at Pangong Tso, a rugged lake surrounded by imposing mountains – perfect for using as a base for the area’s many hiking trails. "
"Madurai temple, India","In Madurai, Hindu undertones are ever-present and there’s an interesting mix of a booming tech industry taking place inside of ancient buildings. Covered with thousands of colorful statues, it’s possible to look at the Meenakshi Amman Temple for days without noticing even half of the small details it hosts. Visit during the Chithirai Festival to witness a ten days of nonstop celebration honoring the marriage between the Hindu gods, Shiva and Parvati.

The museum also offers yoga classes, and easy access to nearby Madurai Government Museum and the Ghandian Literary Society bookshop. "
"Pemayangtse Monastry, Sikkim, India","Mention Sikkim and expect unanimous praise by all of those who’ve been to this green state.

Experienced climbers can summit Kangchejunga, the world’s third-highest peak. "
Bikaner,"Covered in orange dust, off the tourist trail, and hosting camel safaris, Bikaner is an adventurous desert town in Rajasthan. Junagarh Fort, a fortress for old royalty was a stronghold in the fifteenth century that was often attacked, but only captured for one day. Also visit the other desert architecture sites of Jain Temple Bhandasar, the Royal Cenotaphs, Lalgarh Palace, and Shri Laxminath Temple. For a natural site, head to Gajner Lake, where you can walk along the shoreline next to the Gajner Temple. "
"Humayun&#8217;s Tomb, Delhi, India","With over 25 million people residing in Delhi, India’s capital is comprised of modern shopping malls and old ruins. Guidebooks often compare it to Rome, citing that it’s an eternal city with a revolving door of ruling empires throughout the ages. Visiting Delhi as a tourist can be overwhelming or intimidating, so be sure to set aside a day each for Old Delhi, New Delhi, and South Delhi. You can find the Red Fort and Margets of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi, the India Gate, Humayun’s Tomb, Khan Market in New Delhi, and the Lotus Temple and Qutab Minar in South Delhi. It’s not a city you can rush through, or expect that everything will go smoothly due to ever-present traffic and millions of people vying for limited space. However, if you give the city a fair chance, you just might love it. "
"Kochi, India","Set in the lush state of Kerala, Kochi is a vibrant city with a perfect blend of beach and jungle, often further away from the tourist trail than its counterparts. While here, check out Fort Cochin, Mattencherry Palace, the Jewish quarter, and try your hand at scoring a catch-of-the-day with a Chinese fishing net (for a price, of course). While in Kochi, load up on the local fare. Kochi has implemented its own cuisine flare to just about every dish served in the region. Coconuts, tamarind, and bananas are common ingredients added to Indian meal staples that are often eaten without. "
Bangalore,"Known for having great weather, clean streets, well-manicured public parks, the Garden City of India is a peaceful and trendy must-see destination. Western brands and chain restaurants intermingle with local, locally owned businesses all along MG Road while tourist-free totes can be found in the neighborhood of Koramangala. Nonetheless, it’s a great base for day trips to waterfalls, trekking paths, natural hills, and the Bheemeshwari Fishing Camp. Visit Bangalore during the middle or the end of your trip to India, when you’re more likely to appreciate the modern comforts it has to offer. "
Cataract Falls,"The largest waterfall in the state of Indiana can be found inside Cataract State Park. Cataract Falls drops for a total of 86 feet, with the upper falls making up 20 feet of this figure. The hike to the falls is of moderate difficulty and less than three miles in length, with the best time to visit between December and May. As Cataract Falls is made up a long series of cascades, many of the trails within Cataract State Park are within site of the beautiful falling water. "
Brown County State Park,"Brown County State Park is the largest state park in Indiana, attracting over one million people every year. The park is named after Commanding General of the United States Army, General Jacob Brown. The state park is often referred to by its nickname the Little Smokies due to its resemblance to the Great Smoky Mountains. With 70 miles of horse trails, as well as hiking and mountain biking trails, Brown County State Park is perfect for those who enjoy scenic views. The rare Yellowwood tree on Trail 5 is one of the many highlights of Brown County State Park. "
Kissing Bridges,"Kissing bridges are one of the main tourist attractions Indiana has to offer, with these beautiful structures found all over Brown County. Some 21 of these covered bridges are still in use across Indiana&#8217;s Parke County, with many of them now covered in romantic notes that have been left by visitors. The covered bridges are known as kissing bridges as they were one of the few places courting couples could find some privacy hundreds of years ago. October is perhaps the best time of the year to see Indiana&#8217;s kissing bridges as this is when an annual festival dedicated to the structures is held in Parke County. "
Indiana Wetland,Kesling Wetland and Farmstead is one of the best places in Indiana to get up close with the state&#8217;s nature. The 10-acre marsh and slough wetland community is ideal for those who want to learn about how important it is to conserve the natural environment. Sunset and sunrise are two of the best times of the day to visit Kesling Wetland and Farmstead due to their spectacular sights. 
"Turkey Run State Park, Indiana","Turkey Run State Park in Parke County features 14 picturesque miles of challenging trails, as well as the Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve. Cut into the sandstone of the park, the canyons can be seen and experienced from six trails through the park.

"
Clifty Falls State Park,"Clifty Falls State Park is home to some of the most popular events in Indiana, such as the July Regatta hydroplane boat race and the Madison Chautauqua Festival of Art in late September.

Nappanee,"Nappanee is one of the most beautiful locations within the state of Indiana, with its wide of range of tourist attractions, including the Arts &amp; Crafts Festival.

Bean Blossom,"Bean Blossom &#8211; sometimes styled as Beanblossom &#8211; is one of Indiana&#8217;s most beautiful places and is home to one of the many covered bridges that Parke County is famous for. Bean Blossom is home to the Bill Monroe Memorial Music Park and Campground, which hosts an annual bluegrass festival known locally as the Bean. Bean Blossom is found about two miles west of Helmsburg. "
"East Pierhead Lighthouse, Michigan City",
Indiana Winter,"Winter in Indiana is perhaps when the state is at its most beautiful. The south shore of Lake Michigan is one of the best places to go in the Indiana winter, as it is home to a number of ice skating rinks, while sporty people will also enjoy the chance to go cross-country skiing. One of the most fun things to do during winter in Indiana is to take a horse-drawn sleigh ride at Buckley Homestead in Lowell, which is available on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. "
Hoosier National Forest,"Hemlock Cliffs Falls is arguably the most beautiful spot in the whole of Indiana, with the falls located within the Hoosier National Forest. Many people heading to the falls use the Hemlock Cliffs National Scenic Trail, which is a little over a mile long and is accessible all year round. Hiking and camping are both very popular within Hoosier National Forest. Hemlock Cliffs Falls is so named as the tall evergreen with short needles and small cones thrives in the forest. "
"Brown County State Park, Indiana","Brown County is also one of the most beautiful locations in Indiana, with its mix of unincorporated communities and over 170,000 acres of forested land making it a great place to experience what Indiana is all about. Tour Bill Monroe&#8217;s Music Park, Big Woods Brewery and the Brown County Railroad Museum to see the best of what Brown County has to offer. "
Lake Michigan,"Among the most popular tourist attractions in the state of Indiana is the stunning Lake Michigan, which is the only one of the Great Lakes of North America to be located wholly within the boundaries of the United States. Indeed, Lake Michigan is so massive that it is sometimes known as the third coast of the States, with many beaches to explore and enjoy. For people wishing to camp near to the gorgeous banks of Lake Michigan, both Indiana Dunes State Park and the Indiana National Lakeshore are well worth visiting. The area is also home to the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farmstead trails, where visitors can learn more about the history of Indiana. "
Gili Islands,"A trio of picture-perfect islands that string their way out between Lombok and Bali in the middle of the Nusa Tenggara archipelago, the Gilis are oft hailed as the most quintessential tropical spots on the planet. The two smaller islands, Gili Air and Gili Meno, are secluded and laid-back; places where the occasional bamboo ecolodge hides in the mangroves and stretches of shell-spotted sand eke down to a sea of aquamarine blue. The largest island, Gili Trawangan, is a livelier affair. Its ramshackle bars are built of driftwood, and pulse with the energy of backpackers from all over the globe. By day, these guys sizzle off their hangovers on the pearly beaches, or hit the seas in search of rare turtles. By night, they guzzle beers and buckets and party till dawn. "
Bali,"A place that really needs no introduction, Bali has long been a mecca for travelers eager to sample the mysterious east. And while the influx of Aussies and Brits has taken its toll on spots like Kuta in the south, there do remain pockets of the earthy, aga (ancient) Bali here too. Check out the jungle-shrouded town of Ubud in the heart of the regency; a place of cascading rice paddies and crumbling Hindu shrines now taken over by crab-eating macaques. Or, go north to the great volcanos of Kintamani, to watch the sunrise over Lombok isle in the east. Alternatively, you could just surf and party your days away on the beaches of Bukit and Nusa Dua – it&#8217;s all good! "
Lombok,"Lombok has risen and risen out of obscurity in the last couple of decades to become something of the thinking man&#8217;s alternative to Bali. With less of the gaudy bars and super clubs of Kuta, this one retains the rustic, ramshackle feel of old Indonesia. Make a beeline for salt-washed Senggigi on the western shore. Here, traditional warung (homey local taverns) serve up spicy noodle fries and peanut-packed sate dishes close to the shore. There are surfing opportunities aplenty too, from Kuta Lombok in the south to the pretty coves that fringe the coconut groves all along the west coast. "
Yogyakarta,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-yogyakarta-indonesia/"">Yogyakarta</a> sits in a well-deserved fourth place here, thanks largely to its artsy character and cultural richness. Nestled between the great Buddhist rises of Borobudur – perhaps Indo&#8217;s best-known UNESCO site – and the rising volcanic domes of Central Java, it&#8217;s a place steeped in heritage. Check out the sprawling Kraton, which was once the stomping ground of Java&#8217;s sultans of old. This huge palace come museum is now packed with opulent carriages and pleasure gardens where the king&#8217;s harems once resided. Yogya is also known for its traditional craft markets, which erupt on Pasar Beringharjo and Kranggan each day – just try not to stay up drinking in the backpacker bars if you want to catch the best bargains! "
Jakarta,"Sprawling, seething <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-jakarta-indonesia/"">Jakarta</a> is home to more than nine million people (and there are a whopping 30 million people in the greater metro area besides!), making it a heady and frenetic place to get to grips with Indonesia. But between the shimmering skyscrapers and raucous food courts of this massive megalopolis, it&#8217;s quite easy to discover some genuine charm and interest. Take the colossal Monas monument, which can&#8217;t be missed at 137-meters high, or the enchanting Kota Tua old town, where Dutch colonial mansions mix with the twisting fumes of purring scooters. At night, the traveler bars of Jalan Jaksa are the best place to be. "
Borobudur,"Colossal stupas carved from graphite-hued stone tower overhead; mysterious reliefs depicting old Buddhist tales mark the rocks in front. And on the horizon, the belching smoke trails of Central Java&#8217;s mighty volcanos issue steam and sulfur into the mountain chains. Welcome to Borobudur: perhaps the single most famous UNESCO World Heritage Site in all of Indonesia. Yep, this awesome 8th-century wonder still reigns as the largest Buddhist site on the globe. It actually fuses motifs from Hinduism into its architecture, and today travelers are invited to gawp at the multitude of massive pagodas, the intricate murals, and the sheer ambition of the ancient undertaking. "
Raja Ampat,"Raja Ampat is the patchwork of turquoise seas and kaleidoscopic coral reefs that every SCUBA diver dreams of. Located way off-the-beaten-track, it fragments from the side of Papua on the extreme eastern – and unexplored – edge of the Indonesian archipelago. Hardly visited at all, the place is wild and rugged, comprised of more than 1,000 individual rocks that rise dramatically from the shimmering ocean as mangroves and primeval jungles encrust their bases. The large islands of Waigeo and Batanta are two of the top spots, and are now laden with dive organizers offering trips into the crystal-clear waters. "
Komodo,"Sun-baked Komodo is a wild and inhospitable place. Isolated out between the cobalt seas and corals of the Lesser Sunda chain, it&#8217;s famed primarily as the home of the world&#8217;s largest living lizard: the aptly-named Komodo dragon. However, that great stalking beast is just one of the attractions, and today travelers come to witness the rugged hills and dust-caked backcountry as it tumbles down to pink-hued beaches and shore waters laden with rays, sea turtles, pygmy seahorses and rainbowfish. Aside from that, sea kayaking around the rocky headlands is also becoming popular – expect wild, empty coves that few have ever explored before you! "
Bandung,"The second-largest city in the nation is a charmer compared to the capital. Dotted with swaying palm trees and enfolded by the misty peaks of wild Western Java, it&#8217;s got an enviable location in the cool highlands of the country. Add to that a rich tradition of batik fabric making, along with a smorgasbord of local food delights (the steamed bakso tahu in tofu and peanut sauce is simply to die for!), and it&#8217;s easy to see why this one&#8217;s such a hit on the traveler circuit. Oh, and there are oodles of flowing tea plantations just on the outskirts of town – go to Ciwidey or Pangalengan if you fancy a fresh cuppa! "
Bukit Lawang,"Bukit Lawang is the gateway to the domain of the orangutan. Located deep in the jungles of northern Sumatra, the place is a rustic affair; made up of just a few bamboo-built longhouses and riverside teahouses. It&#8217;s typically laden to the brim with ecotourists and backpackers, who flit between the palm-shaded gardens of the town and the wild reaches of the Gunung Leuser National Park, where safari walks promise encounters with baboons and Thomas leaf monkeys, not to mention chances to follow the tracks of the elusive (and critically endangered) Sumatran tiger to boot! "
Labuan Bajo,"Labuan Bajo has traditionally been seen as just a convenient stepping stone between the popular haunts of the Nusa Tenggara and the untrodden volcanic ranges and forests of Flores in the east. However, thanks to its clutch of picture-perfect tropical islands (located just a short boat ride from the harbor), the golden sands of beaches like Pede and Binongko, and excellent connections to Indonesia&#8217;s other great cities and sights (think Komodo Island), it&#8217;s now a fully-fledged destination in its own right. You can fill your time with trekking to crater lakes or diving in the crystalline seas, explore the gushing Cunca Wulang Waterfall or boat across to beautiful Seraya Kecil isle. "
Samarinda,"The eastern gem of Samarinda straddles two worlds. On the one side of town there are throbbing bazaars, awash with carved wooden trinkets from the tribal world of Kalimantan and beset by stacks of intricate handmade batik. That all exists below the soaring spires of the city mosque, and is ringed by dusty streets of chattering locals. And on the flip side comes the industry, which, for Samarinda, means coal. The town&#8217;s array of smoke-belching mines has caused numerous problems on the environmental front, and even spawned some unsavory-looking shopping centers. Still though, Samarinda remains a great riverside stop-off in the midst of wild Borneo. "
Surabaya,"Don&#8217;t expect to be wowed into submission by sprawling Surabaya straight away. Trust us: It takes time to get to know this megalopolis of nearly nine million people on the edge of East Java. First, you&#8217;ll need to get past the incessant stream of tooting traffic and the fumes of industry and business. And when you do, only then can you go in search of treasures like the elegant Dutch mansions that pepper the Chinatown district (one of the biggest Chinatowns in the world no less). There&#8217;s also the artsy rooms and coffee shops of the House of Sampoerna to explore, not to mention the bustling markets and spice-scented food courts of G-Walk after dark. "
Tana Toraja,"Delve into the earthy tribal cultures of South Sulawesi with a trip to the enthralling town of Tana Toraja. One of the strongholds of the indigenous Toraja peoples of the jungle-dressed mountain ranges here, the place is imbued with the striking Tongkonan houses of the locals. These ship-like buildings are formed from elegant arches of woods and inlayed reeds, and are one of the most significant aspects of the Toraja traditions. Tana also comes fringed with mysterious burial sites, peppered with monolithic stones and carved rock effigies representing animist spirits. In short: it&#8217;s a glimpse into the deep, folksy and ancient traditions of this aged island nation. "
Lake Toba,"If you were to have visited Lake Toba around 77,000 years ago, you would have been able to witness one of the most climatic events in the history of global geology. This is when the colossal crater lake last exploded in a volcanic eruption of epic proportions, changing temperatures across the world and altering the weather patterns of the whole planet. Today, Toba is a much more serene place, and the old caldera is now totally filled with water. It&#8217;s known as the largest volcanic lake on the planet in fact, and draws swimmers, boaters and ecotourists alike to its shores. "
Grotto Of The Redemption,"The largest man-made grotto in the world, this Iowa institution is a must-visit for anyone heading to the state. Frequently described as the eighth Wonder of the World, the Grotto of the Redemption is a series of nine grottos that each depict a scene from the life of Jesus. More than 100,000 people head to the grotto every year, with some $4 million worth of minerals and rocks having been used to create this beautiful place. The grotto was given a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and jasper, quartz, topaz, calcite, stalactites and stalagmites can all be seen at the Grotto of the Redemption. "
"Effigy Mounds National Monument, Iowa","Iowa is known as being one of the most rural places in the United States, if not in the whole world, but that does not make the state any less beautiful. The Iowa River Valley is arguably the best place in the state to experience its raw, natural beauty, while the River Valley Lodge and Campground in Farmington is worth visiting for anyone seeking somewhere more developed. Dozens of miles of unspoiled horse trails can be enjoyed at your own pace in gorgeous Iowa. "
"Snake Alley, Burlington","Once recognized by Ripley&#8217;s Believe It or Not for being the world&#8217;s most crooked road, Snake Alley in Burlington is without a doubt one of the oddest sights to see in Iowa. With seven curves over 275 feet, Snake Alley is lit by replica Victorian lampposts in order to maintain its unique old-timey feel. The alley dates back over 100 years and was originally created as a shortcut to Burlington&#8217;s business district, but today it is best known as a strangely beautiful tourist attraction. "
"Pikes Peak State Park, Iowa","One of the most photographed places in Iowa, Pikes Peak State Park is a must-visit location in the state for anyone who wants to experience the natural, cultural and historical resources of Iowa. majestic views of the Mississippi River are available from the highest point in the park and the breathtaking scenery is well worth the tough climb to the top. Pikes Peak, which officially became a state park in 1936, covers nearly a thousand acres and there are hiking trails and campgrounds to enjoy within the grounds of the state park. "
Des Moines,"The capital of Iowa, Des Moines is also the most populous city in the state and is home to many of the most popular tourist attractions in Iowa too. The Capitol Building is a must-visit location for anyone who wants to see stunning architecture, while the best day out to be enjoyed in Des Moines is arguably at Iowa State Fairgrounds. Blank Park Zoo, Pappajohn Sculpture Park and the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden are also well worth visiting. The State of Iowa Historical Museum is another Des Moines place to add to the list of places in the city to check out. "
"Black Hawk Bridge, Lansing","Popularly referred to locally as the Lansing bridge, Black Hawk Bridge is a crossing over the Mississippi River from Iowa to Wisconsin. Opened in 1931, the bridge is a stunning piece of engineering, boasting one of the more unusual designs of any Mississippi River bridge. The bridge is named after Chief Black Hawk of the Sauk tribe, who were involved in an uprising in 1832. "
"Crystal Lake Cave, Dubuque","Located five miles south of Dubuque, Crystal Lake Cave is without a doubt one of the most beautiful places to visit in the state of Iowa. Pristine stalagmites, helictites and rare anthodites are all on show in this stunning cave system, which is described by its organisers as a Matchless Wonder. The picnic-perfect outdoor pavilion at Crystal Lake Cave is a great place to relax, while the cave complex also has its own gift shop. "
Famous Iowa 80 Truckstop On Interstate 80,"With so much of Iowa being exceptionally rural, perhaps the best way to experience the state at its most natural is via the open road, with Interstate 80 the most obvious option from which to do this. The road travels all the way through the heart of the state, while visitors should make sure they take a break at Iowa 80, which describes itself as the largest truck stop in the whole world. The truck stop now has a vast array of facilities including a 300-seat restaurant, a barber shop, a 60-seat movie theatre and a huge food court with a range of culinary options. "
"Mississippi River, Iowa","The Mississippi River is one of the United States&#8217; most beautiful natural attractions and one of the best places to see it is in Keokuk, Iowa. The Keokuk-Hamilton Bridge is one of the most beautiful crossings over the Mississippi River, which borders Iowa for a total of 300 miles. Fishing is an extremely popular activity in the Mississippi River among the Iowa people, while Keokuk itself is home to an annual American Civil War reenactment, as well as attractions such as the Keokuk Veteran&#8217;s Memorial, the Miller House Museum and the George M. Verity River Museum. "
John And Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park,"Another of Iowa&#8217;s top tourist attractions is John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park, which can be found in Des Moines. With more than 20 sculptures from celebrated artists, the John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is one of the top places of its kind in the whole country. The 4.4 acre park is open during city park hours, which run from sunrise to midnight, with guided tours of the sculptures available from April through to October. Touching and climbing on the sculptures is understandably forbidden, apart from Scott Burton&#8217;s incredibly beautiful Seating for Eight creation. "
"Pella, Iowa","Pella is not one of the biggest towns in Iowa, but the Dutch community is certainly one of the most beautiful places to visit within the borders of the state. Pella has been given titles such as Tourism Community of the Year and Corporate Friend of Tourism, with many visitors soaking up the incredibly natural beauty at its Lake Red Rock, which is the largest lake in Iowa. Tulip Time is perhaps the best opportunity to visit Pella, as this is when the Dutch community comes into its own, while the Sinterklaas Christmas parade and the July Dutch summer festival known as Kermis are also well worth checking out during a visit to Iowa. Among the best tourist attractions in the town are the Pella Historical Village and the Scholte House Museum and Gardens. "
Central Iowa,"Central Iowa may be dominated by the state capital, Des Moines, but there is a lot more to explore in this part of the world too. One beautiful place that is well worth visiting on a trip to the state is Ames, which was ranked ninth on CNNMoney.com Best Places to Live list a few years ago. The Octagon Center for the Arts is one of the best spots in Ames, while nearby Fort Dodge is worth visiting too, with the Fort Museum and Frontier Village a particular highlight. "
"Naqsh-e Jahan Square, Esfahan","Gilded with the riches of more kings and sultans and Muslim caliphs than you can shake a cobalt-blue ceramic pot from a Zagros Mountain village at, the glorious city of Esfahan is unquestionably one of the most beautiful in all of Iran. Its heart is dominated by the colossal Naqsh-e Jahan Square; a UNESCO World Heritage Site that’s ringed by ceramic-fronted mosques and gorgeous Safavid palaces. Elsewhere and babbling fountains give way to tree-dotted avenues, legendary madrassahs pop up on the streets, and arabesque souks burst with multi-coloured stacks of spices and tassel-fringed carpets from the east. In short: Esfahan is the Iran you really have to see. "
"Nasir al-Mulk Mosque, Shiraz","Eulogized and eulogized over and over again by romantic poets and travelers, and revered as the birthplace of the great Persian wordsmiths Hafez and Sa’di, Shiraz is a city steeped in heritage and culture. Visitors will be able to spot the great tombs of those writers nestled between the palm-dotted, flower-sprouting gardens of Afif abad and Eram, along with the intricate arabesque interiors of the Nasir al-Mulk Mosque and the 1,000-year-old Qor&#8217;an Gate. Rather surprisingly, the town also lends its name to a popular strain of wine, and, despite the cascading vineyards of the Fars Province long since having dried up, it&#8217;s thought that some of the world&#8217;s earliest white tipples were produced here nearly seven millennia ago! "
"Azadi Tower, Tehran","One&#8217;s thing&#8217;s for sure: Tehran certainly isn’t a looker like Shiraz or Esfahan. Apart from the rugged wall of snow-tipped Alborz Mountains that rise like a phalanx on the northern edge of town, the place is largely dominated by concrete and packed with smog-creating traffic jams aplenty. However, like it or loathe it, this sprawling metropolis is the epicentre of the country&#8217;s politics and economy, and that surely counts for something, right? Well, a lot actually. Great monuments like the Azadi Tower have been raised here, while the glimmering wonders of the Treasury of the National Jewels and the mummified princes of the National Museum of Iran are just some of the awesome relics to see. Add to that a clutch of stylish teahouses and coffee shops, frantic bazaars and youthful student energy, and Tehran really isn’t all that bad! "
Dizin,"Perched nearly 3,000 meters up in the snowy heights of the Alborz Mountains, where the European Caucuses crash into the Asian ranges, the small hill station of Dizin has firmly established itself as one of Iran&#8217;s top winter sports destinations. With a clutch of good groomed pistes ranging from moderate difficulty to challenging runs, and a selection of cableways and chairlifts that were first installed in the 1960s, the soaring resort is one of the top places to don the skis and salopettes here. There are also some alpine-style hotels, and awesome views of the cone of massive Mount Damavand in the distance. "
"Amir Chakhmakh, Yazd","The adobe warren of the Yazd old town is like something out of Arabian Nights. Here and there, turrets gilded in intricate geometric designs loft above the mosque domes; the scents of incense and mint tea twist and turn from the cafes. Meanwhile, the middle of the city is dominated by mysterious Zoroastrian fire temples and the spiked minarets of the Shia hussainia that is the Amir Chakhmakh complex. And then there are the souks, where dust devils twirl between the cotton and silk emporiums, and shisha pipes puff in the background. Yep, it&#8217;s precisely the sort of place you&#8217;d expect to trace the footsteps of one Marco Polo! "
Persepolis,"Great kings by the name of Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes all set foot between the sun-scorched streets of Persepolis once upon a time, for it was here, amidst the arid erstwhile vineyards of Shiraz and the babbling Pulvar River, that the mighty Persian Empire made its home from the 5th century to the 3rd century BC. Today, only traces of this once feared power in the east remain, with a clutch of looming marble columns and a couple of stele all that&#8217;s left to mark the great compound out amongst the rising hills of Rahmet Mountain. Travelers can immerse themselves in the history, and even see the tomb of the revered king Darius I. "
Blue Mosque,"With a history of more than 4,500 years, there&#8217;s evidence to show that Tabriz is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the entire world. That deep past now reveals itself in the layers of architectural majesty the place is known for, at spots like the colossal Blue Mosque of 1465, which comes gutted with shimmering ceramics of a deep cobalt blue. Another real must see is the sprawling Bazaar of Tabriz, which is known as one of the great trading outposts of the old Silk Road. Today, the vaulted ceilings and alcoves of this ancient merchant centre still burst with shimmering gold jewellery and blood-red carpets, sweet-smelling Turkic pastries and oodles of spice from the east. "
Ali al-Ridha,"Mashhad is hallowed ground for many Iranians. It houses the revered tomb of the eighth Imam of Shia Islam: Ali al-Ridha (or Imam Reza). It&#8217;s a seriously holy place, and is appropriately marked by the colossal Imam Reza shrine, which sprawls over nearly 600,000 square meters in the middle of the city; a glimmering mass of gold-clad minarets that go over 30 meters into the ski and great domes inlayed with precious metal (it&#8217;s definitely one of the country&#8217;s most breath-taking pieces of architecture). Away from that must-see and Mashhad also has clean streets and curious sculpture art, not to mention some saffron-infused curries that are sure to set the taste buds a-tingling! "
Rasht,"For Iranians, Rasht represents the gateway to the Shomal – a region of verdant hills and high rainfall that&#8217;s really unlike anywhere else in the country. The unique climactic conditions of the high ridges that surround the town are made possible by its enviable location on the edge of the Caspian Sea, which also happens to imbue it was an array of other curious attractions. We&#8217;re talking about the USSR-themed relics relating to the Soviet sympathiser Mirza Kouchak, and the leafy European-style facades of the Shahrdari in the center. However, it’s trips out to see the gorgeous Golestan National Park, where the misty forests house Persian leopards, that usually come up trumps! "
Kerman,"Encompassed by the sweeping deserts of the Iranian south, the old trading outpost of Kerman still clings to the bustling mercantile character it has had since the days when major trading routes between Arabia and India passed this way. Check out the sprawling bazaar in the heart of the city, where five spice mixes with chilli and coriander powder between the vaulted emporiums. There are also earthy Turkic hamams to bathe in, and a warren of mud-brick streets to wander. And once the city&#8217;s done and dusted, be sure to strap on the boots and go intrepid into the ochre-hued hills of greater Kerman Province. "
Ameri House,"Kashan sprouts from the deserts of northern Iran midway between Esfahan and the capital at Tehran. An oasis town, it&#8217;s packed with blooming pockets of date palms and green gardens that are fed with babbling irrigation streams. The buildings are distinctly adobe and brown though, except – of course – for the elegant mansions of the Tabatabaie Residence, the Ameri House and the domes of Aqabozorg. These are remnants of the Qajari royals, who came here and raised magnificent residential structures in the 18th and 19th centuries. There&#8217;s also a throbbing bazaar and beautiful views of the mountains on the horizon. "
Kish,"Just 19 kilometres south of Iran&#8217;s coast, in the sparkling waters of the Persian Gulf, more than one million people discover the island of Kish each year. They come to wallow in a place that&#8217;s quite unlike its mother country in many ways; a place where huge casinos converge on the palm-dotted gardens of opulent resort hotels. However, there are two other attractions that ensure a steady stream of visitors on Kish: shopping and beaches. The first of these comes with the duty-free malls that ring the main town, and the latter comes in the form of sparkling white sands, coral reefs, and awesome SCUBA diving to boot. "
Tomb of Avicenna,"Forged by the Medes and the Assyrians, the Persians and the Parthians, this once great city might not be the legendary metropolis it was in antiquity, but it still comes steeped in all the culture you&#8217;d expect of a place with so many thousands of years of history behind it. It&#8217;s perhaps most famed as the home of the Tomb of Avicenna, which chronicles and honors the life of arguably the most totemic scientific thinker in the Islamic world. And there are other awesome sights to see too, like the Ali Sadr Cave, which is the largest in-cave lake on the planet, and the inscriptions of the Ganjnameh, made by the ancient Persian kings Darius and Xerxes. "
Qom,"Qom is considered one of Iran&#8217;s most holy cities. It&#8217;s packed with soaring minaret spires and the turquoise-hued domes of totemic mosques (don&#8217;t miss the uber-handsome Ahlulbayt Mosque). One of the country&#8217;s cultural and religious centers, it&#8217;s also got some acclaimed madrassahs and draws massive crowds of pilgrims throughout the year. Most come to wonder at the filigrees and pay their respects at the Shrine of Fatima-al-Massumeh, which is the resting place of the sister of the eighth Imam of Shia Islam. "
Ramsar,"Ramsar sits neatly sandwiched between the rugged rises of the Alborz Mountains and the lapping waters of the Caspian Sea. It&#8217;s a truly enviable location; one that imbues this town of neo-classical hotel fronts and palm-peppered avenues with a wealth of good beaches and some seriously jaw-dropping panoramas of the hills that rise to form the Caucasian chains of Azerbaijan to the north. The place has long been one of the top seaside retreats for Iranian luminaries, and continues to draw with its bubbling hot springs and fabled healing waters. "
Erbil,"The 7,000 year old citadel of Erbil has an illustrious history and can be compared to other greats like Cadiz and Byblos. The massive castle in the center of the city is the great highlight here, and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other places not to miss include the Erbil Civilization Museum and the Kurdish Textile Center which are a great way to find out all about the history and culture of this amazing part of the world. "
Ziggurat of Ur,"Ur is known for its Biblical tales of epic floods and fearsome Babylonian kings, and is also known for one of the most beautiful ancient ruins in the region. Located in the southern Iraqi deserts, Ur is the home of the Ziggurat, a tall structure with high walls and steep staircases that would have been used in the days of old to worship the Akkadian moon gods. Certainly this is one of the oddest and most mysterious sights in Iraq. "
National Museum,"It goes without saying that the city of Baghdad has suffered in recent times due to incessant bombing and attacks by insurgent groups. To enter the Green Zone of the city you will need to get a special permit, but there is hope that one day soon people will be able to visit this city once more. When they do, they will find copper bazaars, Assyrian treasures in the National Museum, and monuments such as the Unknown Soldier. "
Basra,"Many people know the name Basra as it was the location for one of the most pivotal battles that happened during the Iraq War. If you scratch below the surface of this city, however, and you will find one of the most fascinating destinations in the entire country. The area is covered in palm forests and the city sits on the Shatt al-Arab River which is lined by the sunny Corniche al-Basra where you can walk along and enjoy the cool evening breeze. This is also the spot where you will find some of the most famous shrines of Islam’s first imams. "
Karbala,"This town may not sound like much but it is actually the place where 30 million pilgrims make their way every year. The area is sacred to Shiite Muslims because of the Imam Husayn Shrine which is the final resting place of the martyr Husayn ibn Ali who died in 680 AD during the Battle of Karbala. It is also said to be the spot that the archangel Gabriel prescribed as one of the most sacred places on earth. As such, every year this town sees thousands of devotees arrive for the Ashura Day of Atonement. "
Hatra,"Sitting in the dusty deserts of western Iraq are the towering columns and ornate temples of Hatra. As a result, this place is known as one of the most amazing archaeological sites in the entire country. Here you will get to glimpse wonders of the Parthian age at this UNESCO World Heritage Site, although in recent years some of this area has been destroyed and it remains to be seen how much of Hatra is still intact. "
Dur-Kurigalzu,"The ancient abandoned ruins of Dur-Kurigalzu date back 3,500 years and this part of Iraq used to be the heart of the Cradle of Civilization of southern Mesopotamia. Close to the mighty Euphrates and Tigris rivers, this was the home of the Kassite kings of old who built the Ziggurat in the 14th century. This can still be found here in the form of striking stonework and mud-brick walls that rise into high towers above the desert and this would also have been used as a marker for camel caravans en route to Baghdad. "
Sulaymaniyah,This is one of the most welcoming and relaxed cities in Iraq and is deemed safe to visit by some foreign governments. Sulaymaniyah is located on the rugged mountains in northern Iraq and has a cool climate compared with many other cities in the country. It also has a thriving arts scene and is famous for its wealth of delicious eateries where you can enjoy toothsome spiced kofta as well as biryani and an array of other delicacies. If you want to take in the oases towns and valleys of the Goyija and Azmer ranges then this is also a great place to base yourself before venturing further afield. 
"Ishtar gate, Babylon","The name Babylon conjured up images of ancient empires, hanging gardens, and epic battles between Alexander the Great and Persian kings. It is fair to say that restoration and preservation have rather taken a back seat here in recent times, but you can still take in some of the majestic castles here as well as the vast remains of Homera. As you explore Babylon, know that you are walking in the footsteps of great emperors of this part of the world, and you can marvel at artifacts such as gracefully crumbling lion statues and imagine how the Hanging Gardens of Babylon would once have looked. "
Ctesiphon,"In the middle of the 4th century BC, Ctesiphon was a small Persian settlement on the banks of the limpid Tigris River. In the 1st century AD however it became the Parthian capital and grew to include the city of Seleucia. This meant that Ctesiphon became one of the biggest cities in the region by the 7th century and this is where the Arch of Ctesiphon was built. Also known as the Taq Kasra, this is a Sassanid dome that is one of the largest of its kind in the world and one of the most important archeological sites in the region. "
Mosul,"Unfortunately the name Mosul has become synonymous with some of the worst destruction in Iraq to date. For several years the town had been under the control of insurgents and it is now a battleground for the Iraqi military forces. The hope is that Mosul will soon be liberated and that this city that has over 2,000 years of rich history will once again be a place that people can visit. There are some truly amazing sights to be seen here including the crumbling ruins of the Umayyad Mosque that dates from 640 AD as well as the cobalt-blue marble work of the Yahya Abdul Kassem Mashad. "
Dahuk,The Kurdish town of Dahuk sits in a small dusty valley in northern Iraq and is just a short bus journey from the Turkish border. This means that this is one of the easiest places to visit in Iraq and perhaps for this reason it also has a reputation for being one of the friendliest and most welcoming. The town has a wealth of cafes and teahouses and as this is the home of the University of Dahuk there is a strong university town atmosphere here. There are babbling waterfalls located nearby as well as colorful Kurdish marketplaces where you can buy local products like spices and carpets. 
"Sadams Palace, Kirkuk","Kirkuk straddles Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of the country proper and is also famous for its rich oil supply. This means that this part of Iraq has seen a lot of violence and turmoil, and some of its main sights are all things that allude to its tragic past. These include its vast, smoldering oil fields located at Baba Gurgur, as well as ancient citadels which are now crumbling from neglect and the scars of prolonged battles. "
Nineveh,"This used to be the Biblical epicenter of the Assyrian Empire and was made famous by the prophet Jonah, making this an important spot in theological history. Unfortunately much of this city has been ransacked over the years, but you will still find beautiful ruins such as Kuyunjik as well as some ancient gates of the city. "
Zakho,Zakho is a border town nestled close to Turkey and for this reason it has a clutch of good restaurants and hotels and is one of the most accessible places in Iraq. It is also said to be the original spot where Christian missionaries first settled in the country and some of its highlights include the pretty Delal Bridge that stretches over the Little Khabur as well as the haunting ruins of Zakho Castle. 
Cliffs of Moher,"One of the most visited natural attractions in all of Ireland, the Cliffs of Moher rise up from the swells of the great Atlantic Ocean like petrified bulwarks of stone. On top, they are covered with the island’s trademark meadows of verdant green grass, while the waters of Galway Bay crash and froth against the stone below. At a whopping 120 meters in height, these great cliffs offer dramatic views of the coastline and the Aran Islands out at sea, while an all-new visitors’ center makes it easy for travelers to uncover the hundreds of millions of years of geological history that helped form the stratas of sandstone and shale. "
Sligo,"While the small and welcoming town of Sligo packs a punch with its charming medieval core, arched stone bridges, lichen-spotted abbey and wealth of pretty 19th-century townhouses, it’s the backcountry of this one that really hits the mark. Imbued with all the romance you’d expect of the place that helped form the legendary W B Yeats, this area of outstanding natural beauty rises to peaks with the mighty monolith of Knocknarea Mountain (the mythic resting place of Queen Maedbh), comes peppered with moss-clad, centuries-old cairn stones and makes for some truly breathtaking views over the pebble beaches and salt-sprayed towns of Sligo Bay. "
Killarney National Park,"Nestled amidst the other much-vaunted natural treasures of County Kerry, the indelibly wild and untouched reaches of the Killarney National Park are surely worth a mention in their own right. Attested by UNESCO and trodden by herds of majestic red deer, the area hosts great swathes of primeval oak, yew and ash forest. These come interspersed with the beautiful Lakes of Killarney, which sit mirror-like under the curiously-hued tops of the Purple Mountains. The whole place is a veritable mecca for walkers and wildlife lovers, who can weave between peat bogs, moss-caked forests and more, all in the company of swifts, kingfishers and ospreys. "
Boyne Valley,"Stretching for around 110 miles from the verdant heartlands of County Kildare to the Irish Sea, the Boyne Valley is Ireland’s answer to the Loire of France or Meuse of Belgium. Strikingly beautiful and green to the hilt, this land really lives up to the moniker of the Emerald Isle. Between its borders, travelers can see wonders like the Newgrange monument (which is thought to date back more than five millennia) and the crumbling walls and gatehouses of Trim Castle – once the stronghold of Norman rule in Meath. "
The Rock of Cashel,"Oozing a certain gothic mystery and eerie charm from every one of its Game of Thrones-style turrets and keeps, crumbling walls and crenulated gatehouses, the so-called Rock of Cashel clings like an ancient limpet to the green hills of County Tipperary in the south. The site was the fortress of the Munster kings way back in the Early Middle Ages, and still hosts builds like the Round Tower and Cormac&#8217;s Chapel from that period – many of which stood up to English invaders in later years. There are also beautifully haunting graveyards of Celtic stones to see, not to mention sweeping views of the beautiful Munster backcountry. "
Dublin,"Rowdy, raucous Dublin surely needs no introduction! A town of folksy, Guinness-fuelled pubs and elegant Georgian architecture, this capital city continues to draw travelers from far and wide with its cocktail of culture and heritage, class and hedonism. Set midway down the beautiful coast of the Irish Sea, the town boasts the colossal St Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral (the largest of its kind in Ireland) and the acclaimed Dublin Writers Museum, where travelers can unravel the lives of Joyce, Yeats et al. "
Dingle,"The capital of its own eponymous peninsula, found jutting out into the Atlantic swells, Dingle sits sandwiched between the beaches and cliffs of County Kerry and the ridges of the revered pilgrimage spot of Mount Brandon. Steeped in Irish charm, the town is beset by bobbing fishing boats and comes with a distinct, salt-washed seafaring character. Irish is the language of operation here too, while whiskey from the local distillery seems to be the tipple of choice. Aside from wallowing in the backwater vibe here, travelers can opt to explore the beautiful panoramas offered by the Conor Pass, go dolphin spotting, and weave between the boutiques and pubs on central Quay Street. "
Galway City,"Crowned by the colossal Gothicism of St Nicholas&#8217; Church, Galway City once boomed as Ireland’s foremost medieval trading port with connections to the Med. "
Blarney Castle,"Forever drawing day trippers out of the center of Cork, this partly ruined set of keeps and battlements dating from as far back as the 1200s is high on the list of Ireland’s bucket-list sights. Today, some areas of the site have been reconstructed, while the neo-gothic Blarney House stands tall on the side of the castle, and various nature walks showcase the rugged rock formations that pepper the grounds. The real piece de resistance though? Well, that has to be the mythic Blarney Stone, which is said to imbue any that kiss it (easier said than done!) with the gift of the Irish gab! "
Limerick,"Spread over the banks of the River Shannon as it widens to meet the Atlantic on Ireland’s western haunch, the city of Limerick is often overlooked by travellers in favour of the natural draws that have made the region of Munster so famous. However, those who linger here a while will discover a town that’s firmly on the up, reinvigorated after near bankruptcy and ready to showcase its rowdy Guinness pubs and fervent love for the game of rugby. What’s more, the place is still wallowing in the prestige of having been Ireland’s National City of Culture, with spots like the Belltable Arts Centre bursting with new productions and plays, the University of Limerick echoing with plain chant and the city gallery of art hosting events like the EVA International festival. "
Cork,"120,000-strong Cork remains Ireland’s second largest city. It can be found perched out on the coastlines of its eponymous county, cut through by the winding River Lee as it makes its way towards the rollers of the Celtic Sea. Lively, fun-loving, a tad laid-back and proudly divergent to Dublin, the locals here enjoy flitting between their town’s curious coffee shops and traditional pubs, all of which hide in tight-knit streets spouting off the central vein of St Patrick&#8217;s. The spires of St Fin Barre&#8217;s Cathedral overlook the town in glorious Gothicism, while the Cork City Gaol is a prime attraction on the outskirts – if a little gruesome to boot! "
Glendalough,"Nestled between the undulating hills of County Wicklow on the east side of Ireland, the beautiful valley of Glendalough draws visitors with its mix of history and natural wonders. The ancient abbey in the very heart of the site dates from sometime in the early 6th century, was founded by the revered Saint Kevin of Glendalough, and showcases some of the best-preserved early medieval religious architecture in the country. "
The Aran Islands,"Found lingering out in the Bay of Galway, where the icy rollers of the Atlantic Ocean buffet the seaweed-covered coastal rocks, the Aran Island are a remote and off-the-beaten-track option for anyone interested in seeking out some of Ireland’s more wild and untouched areas. Spread over three islands – Inishmore, Inisheer and the large Inishmaan – the archipelago offers up beautiful karst plains cut through by creeks and canyons, all peppered with blooms of red clover and Arctic flowers emerging from the grykes (fissures in the rocky ground). However, natural beauties aside, the Arans are also famed for their deep and traditional heritage. Most of the locals speak Irish day-to-day, the towns come complete with hearty pubs and islander famers’ markets and the clochans (stone houses) and ruins of spots like Dun Aengus belie a past going back all the way to the Bronze Age! "
County Kerry,"Famed as the home of the so-called Ring of Kerry scenic drive, this southern county of the Republic really is one to write home about. Between its borders, this land in the very heart of Munster hosts the likes of the soaring, 1,000-meter-high Macgillycuddy&#8217;s Reeks (home to Ireland’s highest peak, Carrauntoohil) and the church-dotted, cairn-peppered mystery of the Slieve Mish, while out at sea rise the formidable daggers of the Skelligs – Michael with its UNESCO monasteries and Little Skellig with its craggy outcrops. "
Burren National Park,"Sweeping for a whopping 15 square kilometers through County Clare, the Burren National Park (or just The Burren for short) represents surely one of Ireland’s most striking and unforgettable landscapes. Chiselled and chipped from the karst rocks that form the beds of the hills north of Limerick, the area is awash with crevices and grykes that burst with rare flowers and plants. Add to that the monolith tombs of ancient Gaelic tribes, and it’s easy to see why hikers, history buffs, botanists and bird watchers alike all flock to The Burren each year! "
Cowes Week,"For most travellers Cowes will be the first thing you see from the Solent. The town is on both sides of the Medina Estuary, with a ferry terminal in the east and a more traditional settlement in the west. Idle along the meandering, car-less high street for cute shops and cafes with nautical themes. Seafaring is intrinsic to Cowes&#8217; culture and the town is the HQ for the Royal Yacht Club, amongst other prestigious institutions. Be here at the start of August for Cowes Week, a regatta that started back in 1820 and is one of the largest maritime events in the world, with 40 races a day and more than 1,000 vessels. "
Carisbrooke Castle,"The political centre of the island is an agreeable, busy town that has all you need for a shopping trip, with a mix of well-known brands and one-of-a-kind, independent stores. The market trades on Tuesdays as well as Fridays, when farmers from around the island come to sell their produce. In converted Victorian warehouses on the Medina is Quay Arts, the Isle of Wight&#8217;s main cultural centre, with three galleries, a theatre and cafe. For an excursion look no further than Carisbrooke Castle, which was built by the Normans in the 1100s and was where Charles I was imprisoned for more than a year as he awaited execution in 1649. "
Ryde Beach,"This seaside town in the north first caught the eye of the Victorians and Edwardians who would visit to breathe the curative sea air. Karl Marx was one, stopping by in 1874 for health reasons. You don&#8217;t need to look hard to know that it was favoured by posher tourists, as the townhouses and the Royal Victoria Arcade, a refined shopping gallery, will make clear. A century later our motives for coming aren&#8217;t so different, as Ryde Beach and Appley Beach are two of the island&#8217;s best and largest sandy bays, while there&#8217;s a funfair in the tourist season for littler children. In the countryside is Quarr Abbey, a functioning Benedictine Monastery in an eccentric Moorish-style building. There&#8217;s a visitor centre to give you a sense of monastic life and even a cafe. "
Yarmouth Castle,"A cosy old harbour town on the west side of the island, Yarmouth still has the same grid system that the Normans laid out almost a thousand years ago. The port is a useful point of departure for boat trips to see the Needles, three offshore chalk stacks that have been dubbed one of the natural wonders of southern England and are best  approached from the water. The town has a few understated attractions to check out: Yarmouth Castle is a Tudor artillery fort guarding the entrance to the harbour, and Tapnell Farm Park has wallabies, cows, sheep, goats and alpacas for youngsters to interact with. "
Rylstone Gardens,"On an island of pretty, upmarket seaside towns, Shanklin may take the prize. You can pass a carefree afternoon on a deckchair at the beach, or in the leafy surrounds of Rylstone Gardens, with its mature trees, tea rooms and pitch &amp; putt course. Or you could saunter around the town, where shops selling collectibles, speciality clothing and English seaside classics like rock candy are in graceful Victorian buildings. The sandstone geology makes for some marvellous seascapes on the way down to Ventnor. Shanklin Chine for example should be high on everyone&#8217;s agenda: This coastal sandstone ravine is the largest of the Isle of Wight&#8217;s &#8220;chines&#8221;, and plummets 32 metres to the bottom. The high walls create a microclimate that sustains lush subtropical vegetation. "
Ventnor,"The coastal topography is just as uplifting in Ventnor, which is balanced on a slope descending sharply to the sea. The beach is a blend of sand and shingle, and is hemmed by a promenade that gives you lovely panoramas of the sea and wooden hillsides to the west of the town. An interesting fact about Ventnor&#8217;s beach huts is that they are repurposed bathing machines, contraptions that once allowed Victorians to bathe in the sea in private. For a beach off the beaten track, try Steephill Cove, which is a joy at any time of year for its little jumble of fishing cottages, lighthouse and seafood restaurants. "
St Mary&#8217;s Church,"Even though we&#8217;re a couple of miles from the Channel in Brading, the town was once one of the island&#8217;s key seaports. Names like Quay Lane are the only sign of this role, which was brought to an end in the 1500s when the surrounding marshland was reclaimed. There are few old buildings that were around in those times, particularly on the high street, which has the medieval tower of St Mary&#8217;s Church at the top of the hill. Brading Roman Villa is a first-rate archaeological site in which the ground floor of a lavish villa is sheltered by a purpose-built museum. There are fab mosaics, including one of an odd cockerel-headed man, and the children&#8217;s games, jewellery, pottery on show point to the plush lifestyle of the occupants. "
Amazon World Zoo Park,"If you&#8217;re coming to the Isle of Wight with the whole clan, the resort of Sandown meets every need of a smaller tourist. First off you&#8217;ve got a massive golden sandy beach, traced by an esplanade with ice cream parlours and shops selling beach essentials. But there&#8217;s also a number of family-oriented attractions, including two zoos, the Amazon World Zoo Park and the Isle of Wight Zoo. Sandown sits on what is known as the &#8220;Wealdon Outcrop&#8221;, where masses of dinosaur fossils have come to light down the centuries. The museum, Dinosaur Isle introduces little ones to Sandown&#8217;s palaeontology with animatronic dinosaurs and replica fossils. "
Priory Bay Beach,"Another endearing nautical town, Seaview is by the Solent, which is a noble sight in summer when sea is speckled with hundreds of white sails on the strait between here and Portsmouth. The best view is from the Esplanade, which snakes around the seafront and has a few pubs and restaurants with outdoor seating for you to mull over a wonderful scene. If you&#8217;re sea-bound and ready for a voyage there&#8217;s a launch ramp right by the road here. And for landlubbers Puckpool Park is a serene garden on what used to be a Victorian gun installation, while Priory Bay Beach and Seagrove Beach are the best picks if you need sand to go with your sun and sea. "
Bembridge,"This village has been a genteel getaway for affluent types since Edwardian times. At the end of a pier you can call in at the Lifeboat Station, where a volunteer will be happy to talk you through Bembridge&#8217;s relationship with the Lifeboat Institution. You&#8217;ll get the low down  on the Tamar-class craft, which was introduced a few years ago and is designed for the roughest seas. Every part of the lifeboat is totally watertight and even able to &#8220;right&#8221; itself after capsizing. The Isle of Wight&#8217;s last windmill is also in Bembridge and operated by the National Trust. It was built at the start of the 18th century and appeared in a painting by J.M.W. Turner in 1795. "
Godshill Model Village,"It&#8217;s no mystery why this picture-book village is one of the Isle of Wight&#8217;s preferred inland spots. Some of the oldest architecture on the island is in Godshill, along with idyllic thatched cottages with blooming gardens, country pubs and an isolated shop or two. Get a hit of old-school kitch at the Godshill Model Village, which was crafted in 1952 and includes a model of the Godshill Model Village inside it! Look for All Saints&#8217; Church, a Norman building with a medieval fresco of a crucifix of lilies inside. "
Freshwater Bay,"The western side of the island is known as Back of the Wight and is cherished for its pastoral and slightly remote character. This is brought on by the bulky chalk hills and rugged cliffs and rocks on the coast. At Freshwater Bay you can pause over a view that takes in the Stag and the Mermaid, two chalk stacks beside the cliffs. In the 19th century Freshwater welcomed many Victorian cultural icons like Alfred Lord Tennyson and Lewis Carroll. The Dimbola Museum documents this period via the work of Julia Margaret Cameron, a vaunted early photographer. "
"Al-Lahhamin Street, Jerusalem","One of the most historically important cities in the world, Jerusalem is home to the Old City, packed with religious sites like the Western Wall, the Church of Holy Sepulchre – where Jesus is thought to have risen from the dead, and Dome of the Rock. Also visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center and the citadel of Tower of David. It’s a sacred city where Judaism, Islam, and Christianity all hold strong roots. When not venturing through the Old City, head to the more modern area and sit at Ben Yehuda, one of the best spots for people watching. After sunset, go bar hopping and sample the local fare. Beware of visiting on the weekend, when religious ceremonies are likely to take place and restrict tourist movement. "
Tel Aviv,"With beaches, architecture, and historical sites, Tel Aviv is a well-rounded glimpse of Israel where many visitors opt to spend most of their time. Sharpen your bargaining skills at the Camel market in the city center, go wild with the nightlife venues, and explore the alleyways in the neighborhood of Old Jaffa. The neighborhood of Miraflores is prime for shopping (especially diamonds) and trying the trendiest bars and restaurants. Also check out the Beit Hatfutsot Jewish histoy museum, Yarkon Park, and the ornate architecture of the city’s mosques and synagogues. "
Tiberias,"On the western side of the Sea of Galilee is Tiberias, one of the Judaism’s four holy cities and a popular vacation spot for Israelis and foreigners alike. Here, you can enjoy nearby hot springs, the Korazim National Park hosting an ancient synagogue, and a light show every evening that takes place on Tiberias promenade. Tiberias is also the main touch point for Lake Kineret, also known as the Sea of Galilee, where visitors can enjoy boating, fishing, kayaking, and windsurfing on the state’s largest lake. "
Negev,"The Negev Desert spans as far as the eye can see, taking up over half of Israel’s landmass. Venture here for a magical sunrise or sunset to watch the tan sand shift from different hues of red to pink to yellow. Join an ATV tour, make some furry friends at the Negev Camel Ranch, and geology buffs will love the sandstone pillars of Timna Park. Adventure travelers will get a thrill from walking around the Ramon Crater and through the valley of Ein Avdat. If you want to hike through the crater and up to Ramon’s tooth, plan on bringing a jug of water to combat the scorching heat. For those who prefer an expedition that includes air conditioning, hire a driver and travel through Negev with a 4&#215;4 SUV. "
Tsfat (Safed) &#8211; Israël,"Venture to the high altitudes of Safed, also known as Tsfat, where you’ll be in a sacred site atop Israel’s highest city. One of the four holy cities in Israel, Safed is home to a variety of colorful synagogues, mystics, and artists – who all feature their work at local galleries. If you want to dive deeper into Jewish mysticism, head to the Tzfat Kabbalah Center to learn more about sages, artwork, and finding spiritual meaning in life. "
Ashdod,"A lively beach town loved by tourists and locals alike, Ashdod is a modern area with a variety of spas, shops, and parks. Don’t miss seeing Ashdod Yam Park, the fortress at Metzuda Beach, and take a dip at Gil Beach. As a creative touch, Ashdod also hosts “The Eye of the Sun,” a quirky giant sculpture that is illuminated by colorful lights every night (though many visitors claim it just looks like a crashed flying saucer). "
Nimrod Fortress National Park,"The Nimrod Fortress National Park has the ruins of a medieval Muslim fortress that tells a history of the Muslim rulers and their clash with Christian crusaders. It is the biggest castle in Israel, and has been a stronghold since the 13th century. Walk through the fortress and discover dilapidated staircases once leading to a high tower, the outline of a labyrinth of hallways, watchtowers, and prepare to be met with incredible views. "
Beit She’an,"Beit She’an is one of Israel’s most beloved ancient city, that played an important role throughout history due to its strategic location. Today, it’s a mix of modern buildings and ancient ruins where travelers can visit its National Park and wander through the Crusader fortress of Kohav HaYarden. "
Haifa,"Haifa is a modern city in northern Israel that is renowned for its diverse population prolific tech industry and community of young businessmen and women. Come here as a base for Mount Carmel and to admire the manicured Bahai Gardens and Golden Dome temple. Take a walk down Yefe Nof street, the best viewpoint overlooking the city, and grab lunch at Dado Beach. Cultural buffs will also enjoy wandering through Haifa’s many museums, parks, and sports centers. "
Akko,"Acre, or Akko, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its preservation of medieval Crusader buildings intertwined with old Muslim architecture. Its baths, citadel, mosques, are well preserved and can be seen and learned about via a guided tour. Visitors can spend days exploring the Enchanted Garden, the Hospitaller Fortress, the Al Basha Turkish Bath, the Templars’ Tunnel, visiting the Souk market and hundreds of other interesting sites. There are a variety of old inns that are interesting to walk through to see the grounds they would have stayed in dating back to the Crusader Period. "
Garden of Gethsemene,"At the foot of Mount of Olives near Jerusalem is the Garden of Gethsemane, known for being the site where Jesus prayed with his disciples and ascended into heaven. Whether you’re on a pilgrimage of sorts or simply a visitor interested in seeing a beautiful site of olive trees with an undeniable significance, this is a must-see stop while in Israel. If you go, arrive early to beat the crowds and to see the olive trees in soft lighting. "
Bat Yam Beach,"Take a break from the heat of the desert and head to Bat Yam, an uncrowded town known for its pristine beach with interesting sculptures near the sand. Adventure enthusiasts will love Bat Yam as a base for surfing, windsufing, and paragliding. Spend time walking along the boardwalk and promenade, then head inland to the town’s museums for contemporary art and the Havayedda science center. "
Masada,"Overlooking the Dead Sea is Masada, a rust-colored mountain with a foreboding fortress balancing on top, built by King Herod the Great. Legend claims that during a siege of Masada, Jewish rebels commited mass-suicide by choosing to throw themselves off of the bordering cliff rather than be captured by Roman forces. Though exact details are questionable, Masada is a cultural, architectural, and natural must-see attraction while in Israel. The best time to visit Masada is at sunrise, when it’s likely to be less busy and for great views of the desert below. "
The Dead Sea,"The Dead Sea, or the Salt Sea, is the lowest point in the world. Slather yourself in the dark mud and spend a day floating in the salty sea, over eight times saltier than the ocean. Floating in the sea makes you float as though you’ve put on a life preserver vest and is a feeling you won’t be able to get anywhere else in the world. The combination of mud, salt, and heat is thought to purify the body and exfoliate the skin – an experience not offered at your everyday spa. "
Rome,"Ah Rome, The Eternal City, the epicentre of perhaps the mightiest European empire ever, the stomping ground of the Vatican, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the regal Platine Hill, the winding Tiber River, the elegant gardens of the Villa Borghese, the totemic works of Caravaggio and Michelangelo, Rafael and Bernini – the list goes on! A truly bucket list city if there ever was one, the Italian capital draws everyone from history buffs to honeymooners. Whether you hit the streets of the Centro Storico and the bustling al fresco pizzerias of Piazza Navona, the romantic alleys of Trastevere or the even the two-millennium old stones of the Via Appia Antica that run out of town, this city is sure to impress. "
Cinque Terre,"Craggy cliffs and rugged gorges cascade their way down to the rollers of the Ligurian Sea in the UNESCO-attested reaches of Cinque Terre. Visited by thousands of people every year, this truly photogenic section of the Italian Riviera comes studded with the beautiful towns of Manarola, Riomaggiore and Vernazza. Each of these is famed for their pastel-painted, ice-cream-coloured rows of historic homes, which protrude from the rocks of the coast in glorious fashion. Meanwhile, at Monterosso, travelers flit between the new town and the sun-kissed sands of the city beach, sipping Piedmont wines and munching on the region’s famous pesto pasta and focaccia. "
Florence,"The Tuscan capital is a veritable chocolate box of treats for the culture vulture. It was here, during the Italian power boom of the 15th century, that the city became the incubator of the European Renaissance. That means galleries like the famed Uffuzi come packed with masterworks by the likes of Caravaggio, Botticelli and Albrecht Durer, while the Museo Galileo chronicles the successes of the era’s forward thinking scientists. There are also the revered contours of Michelangelo’s David in the Galleria dell&#8217;Accademia, while the Old Town’s Duomo is amongst the most glorious in Italy. Shopping in the jewellers of the handsome Ponte Vecchio is also a hit, as is Florence’s lively summertime nightlife. "
Bergamo,"Crowned by one glorious old town area (the Citta Alta), this veritable jewel of the Lombardy region is regularly overlooked by travelers making a beeline for the lakes of Como and Garda, or the heavily-adorned streets of Milan. Criminal! Those who linger can head for the walled area of the Upper Town to experience the cobblestone streets and earthy pizzerias that abound, spy out the Piazza Vecchia – home to the bubbling Contarini fount and soaring Campanone tower – and the arched walkways of the pretty Cittadella. Even further up the hill in the midst of the city – and connected by funicular rail &#8211; is the charming village of San Vigilio, boasting sweeping views of the foothills of the Italian Alps and some beautiful fine-dining joints to boot. "
Lecce,"Nestled in the undulating, vineyard-clad valleys of Apulia right in the middle of the Italian heel, Lecce is a patchwork of Baroque and ancient architecture. Visitors here can explore the crumbling remnants of a second-century amphitheatre by morning and delve behind the glorious facades of churches like San Giovanni Battista, the Church of the Holy Cross and the bell-tower-topped Lecce Cathedral by afternoon. Of course, the city also comes replete with plenty of sun-splashed piazzas, where gelato holes-in-the-wall give way to enticing wine bars touting the famous labels of the Apulian cellars. "
Favignana Island,"This tear-drop isle in the Mediterranean has long been one of the most coveted Italian holidaying destinations of all. Fringed by beautiful beaches and craggy coves like San Vito and rugged Cala Rossa, the island is perfect for sunbathers and relaxation seekers. Foodies come too, for the curiously Moorish-inspired couscous dishes and top-notch seafood, while history buffs wander wide-eyed around the striking temple ruins of Agrigento. Then there are Sicily’s fascinating cities, shrouded by Etna and the powers of the Cosa Nostra at places like Catania, and sun-kissed and awash with gorgeous Byzantine and Sicilian Baroque churches at Palermo. This one’s simply not to be missed! "
Naples,"Rough-around-the-edges Naples has all the charm of a truly lived-in Campanian city. As one of the longest continuously inhabited places in the world, it’s hardly surprising that it conceals layer upon layer of history and culture between its tight-knit streets. Cutting right through the heart of the centre, crisscrossed by swaying washing lines and dotted with the mysterious gargoyles of Renaissance churches, is the shadowy strip of Spaccanapoli, while pizzerias issue the scents of authentic Italian herbs and tomato passata and mozzarella into the air between the lanes of the Quartieri Spagnoli. Then, on the outskirts of town, the great bucket-list legend of Pompeii and Herculaneum rise under the shadow of Vesuvius; the great brooding caldera of the south. "
Riva del Garda,"Made famous by the mountain-shrouded waters of Lake Garda and Como, this uber-elegant and well-to-do region of the Italian north is really worth the visit. Nestled just north of Milan, the region plays host to postcard-perfect towns, like Como’s Menaggio, cascading elegantly down to the shimmering waters of the lake, or Garda’s Riva del Garda, with its curious Austrian-esque soul and winding narrow lanes. Amidst the two popular lakes sits untrodden Iseo, a beautiful L-shaped gem that has sleepy Lovere and the walking trails of Bossico, all of which is placed neatly down the valley from the bucket-list peaks of the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park. Expect good weather, great food inspired by the Swiss and Austrian kitchens, and some of the most dramatic mountain scenery this side of the Aosta Valley. "
Milan,"A city of business suits (this is where Italy’s stock exchange ticks over) and fashionistas (Milan is the home of arguably the biggest fashion week in all of Europe), Milan seems like the perfect balance of old and new. Its heart is adorned with the flying buttresses and Gothic majesty of one gorgeous Duomo, while the church of Saint Mary of the Graces pulls crowds with the promise of da Vinci’s iconic Last Supper, and the rises of Saint Ambrose are a lesson in all things Lombard Romanesque. Close by to these beautiful basilicas stands the well-to-do arcades of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele; complete with more Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton than you can shake a bowl of saffron-favoured risotto alla Milanese at. "
Bologna,"Learned Bologna lays claim to one of the oldest universities in all of Europe, and today its various districts – most notably the richly adorned Centro Historico and the bar-heavy University Quarter – still pulse with an undeniable youthfulness and vitality thanks to the town’s resident population of more than 100,000 students. But that’s not it. The town also bursts with eye-watering historic sights, like the basilica-ringed Piazza Maggiore, the Fountain of Neptune and the tenuously leaning Tower of the Asinelli. Food is also big in Bologna – the self-proclaimed culinary capital of the nation – as gravy-doused red meat cuts and viscous red wines pour out from the trattorias by the bucket load. "
Siena,"Perhaps Italy’s single most handsome medieval city, Siena is a labyrinth of red-brick palazzos and tight-knit streets. The city centre – the home of the famous Palio di Siena each summer – is the oval Piazza del Campo, where the archways and facades of the Loggia della Mercanzia form the backdrop for countless al fresco eateries and gelato stalls. Higher up through the town and the streets give way to the shimmering white marble of the Siena Duomo, and the looming Renaissance towers and crenulations of the Palazzo Pubblico hide treasures from the city’s former medieval golden age. "
Venice,"The famous City of Canals has long been one of the most iconic places in all of Italy. Beloved of honeymooners and would-be proposers, culture vultures and wide-eyed travelers in search of some of the country’s most impressive architecture, the town was once one of the major players in the Italian power struggles of the 15th century, vying for control of the Adriatic and Med with the likes of Florence. Today, remnants of this Golden Age can be seen in the Doge’s Palace and the spots that line the Piazza San Marco: the Bell tower of St Mark; the red-brick Campanile. Then there’s the winding Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge – the muses of Shakespeare and Monet alike – while further afield is the Venice Lido beach and the acclaimed glass workshops of Murano. "
"Flowers and harbor in Stintino, North Sardinia","Famed for the crystal-clear, aquamarine hues of its shoreline waters, which lap against the rugged rocks and caves of the coast here where the Tyrrhenian Sea meets the greater Mediterranean, Sardinia encompasses bucket list beaches and soaring mountains between its borders. Inland is home to some seriously beautiful hiking trails, which weave up and around the massif of Gennargentu (dusted in snow by winter) and past mountain-shrouded towns like Ozieri and Fonni. Meanwhile, Cagliari hosts bobbing millionaire yachts and terraced lines of colourful Renaissance mansions and palazzos, while the shimmering sands at Villasimius and Chia, secluded Tuerredda and UNESCO-attested Cala Goloritze are simply to die for! "
Turin,"Turin may not be Italy’s most visited or lauded town, but it sure packs a punch from its place in the middle of beautiful Piedmont. The onetime home of the Italian royal family, the city is spiked at the centre by the Mole Antonelliana masonry tower (the highest of its kind in Europe). However, most travelers head to the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist to catch a glimpse of the famous Turin Shroud (when it’s on show), or the earthy and enthralling streets of ancient Quadrilatero Romano (perfect for sampling that Piedmont cuisine). However, Turin is also the perfect gateway to the western half of the Italian Alps, offering travelers access to the sweeping vineyards of Barolo grapes and the ski fields of the Aosta Valley alike. "
Pisa,"Most visitors who make their way to this onetime medieval military power on the edge of the Ligurian Sea are on course for the Leaning Tower, now found swaying tenuously in the midst of the city with its patchwork of Romanesque and Baroque. However, Pisa is much more than just its most famous site. It’s also home to the treasures of the Piazza dei Miracoli, complete with the colonnaded façade of the Pisa Cathedral, and the impossibly beautiful Piazza dei Cavalieri – once the political powerhouse of the Pisan state. Travelers can also stroll between the stuccoed and painted homes that line the Arno as it drifts towards the Med, delve into the region’s famous mineral spas and shop for Tuscan souvenirs amidst the welcoming shops of the Corso Italia. "
"Grand-Bassam, Ivory Coast","Proudly touting its UNESCO World Heritage tag, Grand-Bassam bursts forth from the Ivorian coast with the medley of elegant Parisian mansions and crafted colonial municipal buildings that is the Ancien Bassam district. Now crumbling and creaking with age, this area once reigned as the capital of French Ivory Coast. Some of the buildings have been returned to their former glory, and visitors can still spy out the great Cathédrale Sacré Cœur and the enthralling Museum of Costume. New Grand-Bassam is where most of the action takes place today, while the beaches to the west and east are where the resort hotels reside. "
Abidjan,"The sprawling, beating heart of the nation makes its home on the south coast, along the wide coastal reaches of the Ebrié Lagoon. With more than four million people calling it home, it hails in as the second-largest metropolis in all of West Africa. And although not officially the capital of Ivory Coast (that honour goes to Yamoussoukro), it&#8217;s perhaps the better city to go for an introduction to the nation. Visitors can wander the frenetic streets of the buzzing central Plateau district, see the looming Francophone spires of St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, hit the National Museum, party down heady Princess Road, eat local cassava curries on the street corners – the list goes on! "
Waterfall in Man,"Springing up from the rain-doused, rugged edges of the soaring Toura Mountains, deep in the heartlands of the country, the rustic town of Man comes surrounded by seemingly endless swathes of verdant plantain farms and cocoa plantations. The peaks of Tonkoui and Toura – the two highest in Ivory Coast &#8211; dominate the horizon, while it&#8217;s the crashing courses of the Cascades waterfall that really draws the crowds. Others will come to delve into the famous bamboo forests that filter out from the center, where multi-coloured butterflies flutter by and rare insects inhabit the undergrowth. "
"Taï National Park, Ivory Coast","A colossal slab of over 3,000 square kilometers is taken up by the vast reserves of the Taï National Park, making it one of the greatest protected areas of what remains of the Upper Guinean rainforests – once the dominant habitat in all of West Africa, ranging from Gabon all the way to Senegal. A feral land, it&#8217;s carved with colossal river valleys and dressed in moist woods, spiked with otherworldly inselberg mountains and fringed by rolling savannah. And then there&#8217;s the fauna, which includes the endangered pygmy hippopotamus, swinging olive colobus monkeys, duikers and chimpanzees. "
Jacqueville Beach,"Fringed by a stretch of typically Ivorian ivory sands, little Jacqueville spills down into the sea from the far side of the Ebrié Lagoon, it&#8217;s sun-kissed beaches emerging from the swathes of pineapple groves to meet the frothy rollers of the Atlantic Ocean. Clusters of old Parisian arcades and colonial builds stand decaying under the shade of the palm trees, while thatched beach huts meet painted timber longboats along the shore. It&#8217;s a great place to come and get a feel for the pretty seaside character of this country, and all just a stone&#8217;s throw to the west of the capital at Abidjan to boot! "
San-Pédro,"San-Pédro&#8217;s harbours jut out from the southern forests of Ivory Coast like great tendrils poking into the Atlantic waters. The second-largest port town in the country, this spot on the sea has been churning out huge cargos of metal ores and minerals and fish for decades. Around it has exploded a lively, energetic and endearingly gritty city of low-rise homes and dusty streets, all interposed with the occasional nightclub and beer bar. There are also plenty of natural draws beckoning nearby; from the primeval Upper Guinean rainforests of the Taï National Park to the shining beaches of Bas-Sassandra. "
"Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast","A visit to Yamoussoukro is a strange experience. Imbued with wide boulevards and grand open spaces, shiny new (or at least relatively new) governmental buildings and high-rise hotels, the metropolis of 300,000 can seem like a ghost town. It&#8217;s worth remembering that it was only chosen as the capital of Ivory Coast back in 1983 – a pet project of President Houphouët-Boigny&#8217;s, who was actually born here in 1908. Still, there are some interesting sights, and not least of all that colossal Basilica of Our Lady of Peace; the largest Christian church on the planet and a mass of domes and columns that reflects the grandeur of Rome itself! "
Mosquée de Korhogo,"Contrarian Korhogo has a long history of political instability and opposition to the status quo. It was here that the latest round of coup d&#8217;etats unfolded in the early 2000s, with rebel groups proclaiming against the government. Today, things are a little quieter &#8211; or at least as quiet as it&#8217;s possible to be in forever radical Korhogo! Aside from the revolutionary tendencies, the mud-caked city is a truly fascinating place, bustling with bazaars packed with cotton and cashew nuts and spices, the enchanting Woodcarver&#8217;s Quarter beckoning with whittled crafts, and the Village des Tisserands (located just a stone&#8217;s throw away) home to batik cloth makers and more! "
Bouaké,"One of the great crossroads between the Ivorian north and the Ivorian south, Bouaké sits virtually midway between the Atlantic coast, the northern borders, Guinea in the east and Ghana in the west. And while the national divisions manifest here in the form UN peacekeepers, the city remains something of a fusion of all the various tribal and political influences at work, complete with an earthy character and interesting locals. It&#8217;s the markets, the arts and the crafts that really come center stage though. The whole region of the Eastern Plantations is not only famed for its cotton output, but you&#8217;ll spot local traders touting black-clay pots around the rises of St Michael&#8217;s Cathedral, and oodles of other fascinating emporiums to explore. "
Comoe National Park,"Spread-eagle between the northern cities and the Ghanaian borderlands, the sweeping lands of the Comoe National Park are a veritable magnet for ecotourists and outdoorsy types heading to Ivory Coast. They bloom with weathered gallery forests and rolling savannah plains, the occasional splinter of soaring rock and the winding meanders of the Comoé River. And around their riparian habitats, visitors can look for the likes of yellow-backed duikers and Mona monkeys, colobuses and pangolins, stalking leopards and stalking lions, and plenty, plenty more! "
Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve,"Crawling across the borders of the Ivory Coast and into the wild, wild reaches of southern Guinea, this soaring arch of mountainous peaks is considered by UNESCO to be one of the most important nature reserves in all of West Africa. Why? Well, the habitats range from rare lowland rainforests to altitudinous grass plains, and that gives rise to one of the most kaleidoscopic line-ups of fauna in the region. Walkers who make the intrepid journey here (usually from nearby Danane) can expect chimpanzees and rare butterflies, alien toad species and otter shrews to boot. "
Assouinde,"Just a little further along the coast from Grand-Bassam and attached to the metropolis of Abidjan by the main road A100, Assouinde is perhaps the most celebrated beach resort in the country. Popular with city slickers eager for a break from the fray of the town, the long stretches of yellow sand here host a clutch of great hotels and accommodations. On the one side, these back onto the mirror-like lagoons and winding waterways of the Lagunes region, and on the other they spill into the Atlantic, where rolling surf and plenty of sunbathing and beachcombing opportunities abound. "
Sassandra,"Another of the favoured gateways to the beach-fringed, salt-sprayed stretches of the Bas-Sassandra district in southern Ivory Coast, the city of Sassandra boasts layer upon layer of colonial history. With its prime location on the edge of the Gulf of Guinea, it was settled by the Portuguese, the Brits and the French, and established itself as one of the great logging ports in West Africa. Today, the town is still largely industrialised, but there are also rows of powdery beaches, historic lighthouses and a clutch of local beer bars and cafes to settle in. "
Marahoué National Park,"Recently hitting the headlines due to the unfortunate acceleration of deforestation throughout its boundaries (it&#8217;s estimated that Marahoué has lost as much as 93% of its woodland cover in the last decade alone!), this small protected reserve close to the capital of Yamoussoukro is the place to go if you&#8217;re looking to get stuck into the frontline of West African conservation. Once a home for chimpanzees and large elephant herds, the area&#8217;s fauna might just be a shade of what it was, but there is now education, awareness-raising and policing operations in action to help turn things around. "
Abengourou,"Abengourou is an interesting stop-off in the extreme east of the Ivory Coast. One of the ancestral cities of the Akan peoples, it&#8217;s still got the head house of the town chieftain, which comes adorned with rows of mysterious artifacts and relics. There are streets of tin shack houses and lively little local markets too, along with a clutch of Christian religious buildings, topped with a large cathedral church. The Abengourou Airport is also one of the principal entry points for explorations throughout the cocoa fields and plantation lands of the greater region. "
"Kyoto, Japan","A sacred city with iconic temples, shrines, palaces, gardens, and bamboo forests, Kyoto often tops the list of people’s favorite Japanese cities for good reason. In Kyoto, traditional culture is rich and vibrant, seen weaved in the citizen’s daily life.

"Tokyo, Japan","Busy, vibrant, and often the first point of contact for travelers, Tokyo is Japan’s lively capital city. A visitor can easily spend a few days dining on fresh seafood, wandering through the many museums, gazing up at the skyscrapers, and enjoying a lifestyle of opulence and culture. To give a sense of how busy this city of 13 million people can be, the intersection at Shibuya Crossing is known as ‘The Scramble.’ Customs that are simply Japanese are found all throughout the city. In Harajuku, you can watch Japanese fashionistas use the main street as a runway, shop for the clothes yourself, view anime collections, and enjoy the overdose of color. For fresh seafood, head to the Tsukiji Market, thousands of tons of seafood are traded daily. The city also hosts tens of shrines, temples, and palaces perfect for finding peace if the crowds become overwhelming. "
Osaka,"Not your average port city, Osaka has a range of fun things to do for visitors. Osaka hosts Universal Studios Japan, the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, and Osaka Castle Park.

Kamakura,"Escape the chaos of big-city life in Kamakura, a peaceful city with dozens of Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and a gargantuan Buddha statue to greet visitors at the Kotoku-in Temple. In between temples are lush hiking trails leading through bamboo forests and over calm hills. For a fun break from walking, hop on the Enoden, an electric train that weaves between the stations of Fujisawa and Kamakura. It’s loud, rickety, and slow, but a fun experience nonetheless. Kamakura is also known for its beaches, where surfers can catch a wave at Yuigahama Beach. "
Yokohama,"Walking around some streets in Yokohama, you might be mistaken for being in China. This city has a thriving Chinatown and Chinese influence with hundreds of restaurants, shops, and decorations centering around that central theme. Home to 3.7 million residents, this big city considers itself Tokyo’s largest rival, citing its high standard of living and opulent skyscrapers as back-up for this claim. Travelers can witness this rivalry by attending a BayStars game if they ever play the Giants during your stay. The Sankeien Garden is a local favorite, where you can wander in peace through beautiful gardens and view buildings from eras gone past. "
Izu,"Fit for tourists, Izu Hanto has a plethora of relaxing and adventurous activities to choose from that are a far cry from big-city sightseeing.

The city hosts the vibrant Kawazu Cherry Tree Festival, where tourists can appreciate the country’s most iconic blossom with all senses. "
Hiroshima,"During World War II, a nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, killing over 100,000 of its residents and decimating many of the city’s buildings.

Additionally, shops and restaurants are aplenty. "
Shikoku,"The smallest of Japan’s main islands, Shikoku is one of the best places to visit in Japan due to its religious importance which is why it’s often dubbed as the ‘Spiritual Island.’ Many devotees embark on the Shikoku pilgrimage, a 1,200 kilometer walk that takes Buddhist pilgrims to 88 temples and many other religious sites. Visitors can embark on the entire walk, or go to just the main sites that catch their interest. Adventure travelers should take a cycling tour over the Shimanami Kaido Highway bridges, around Omishima Island, and through Imabari, followed up by a relaxing dip in the Dogo hot springs.

Otherwise, consider seeing the sites of the Matasuyama Castle and Uchiko-za Kabuki Theater. "
"Temple in Nikko, Japan","Nikko is a vibrant town located at the entrance of Nikko National Park, home to Toshogu, Japan’s most beloved and lavishly decorated shrine.

Outdoor enthusiasts will also love walking around Lake Chuzenji, a placid lake set on the foothills of the national park. If you’re short on time during your visit to Japan, Nikko makes for a great day-trip from Tokyo. "
Takayama,"Takayama is one of the few Japanese cities to cling tight to its architectural roots. The city does a fantastic job preserving its heritage, especially in the Old Town district, where colorful old merchants’ houses line the streets. During the feudal ages, skilled artists and carpenters took pride in their craft which is why so many of the buildings have an ornate flair. For the best experience, visit during the Takayama Festival, a celebration that happens twice a year and celebrates the arrival of Spring and Autumn. The festival features performances, incredible floats, and draws crowds hailing from all over Japan. You can easily spend a few days passing through temples on the Higashiyama Walk, checking out the museum of Matsuri no Mori, and gaze at the Yatai Kaikan, an exhibition hall filled with festival displays and floats. "
Chichijima,"Perhaps one of the most remote places in Southeast Asia, the faraway island of Chichijima is a hidden island with a tropical vibe. Water lovers will delight thanks to its surfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, whale watching, and more. Interestingly, the journey here requires over a twenty hour boat ride, which is what has kept the island so hidden from the main tourist trail and preserves its magic. "
Petra,"The undisputed piece de resistance of Jordan is a place totally unlike anywhere else in the country. Set out between the red-hued desert escarpments in the southern heartlands of the country, it&#8217;s thought the site was first inhabited in the 4th century BC. It was the ancestral capital of the thriving Arabian Nabataean civilization, which managed to raise the rock-cut treasuries and temples here to one of the most important trading outposts in the region. Today, the whole enchanting site is known for its roles in Hollywood blockbusters like Indiana Jones, and comes hidden between a series of winding siq (tunnels created by erosion) passageways that are a real treat to explore. In short: Petra is not to be missed! "
Al-Maghtas,"Butting up to the Israel-Jordan border on the extreme eastern edge of the country, the dust-caked conglomeration of small dig sites and uncovered builds known as Al-Maghtas is arguably one of the most important biblical relics to be found on the entire courses of the Jordan River. Tagged by UNESCO and slowly becoming a high-profile pilgrimage site for Christians (think papal visits aplenty in the last couple of decades), it&#8217;s thought to have been the original site of the baptism of Jesus. Apart from that, the spot displays an interesting array of Jewish and Christian religious remains, Roman constructions, and Orthodox monasteries from the ages of the Ottomans and Mamluks. "
Amman,"Amman is a great place to feel the beating pulse of Arabia, and get a sense of the deep histories and cultural strands that inform Jordan as a whole. Head to the warren of streets that weave and wind through the hectic center of the capital to see the mosaic of frenetic souks and echoing mosque minarets that make up the famous area of Balad. Or, go to Abdali, where leafy boulevards give way to chic cafes and high-street boutiques. There&#8217;s a clutch of must-see sights and landmarks to add to the menu too: that colossal Roman Theatre; the occasional remains of Ammonite fortifications; the medley of mosques and churches and palisades that make up the Jabal al-Qal&#8217;a citadel… "
Jerash,"It’s a testimony to the sheer wealth of immersive history that still exists at the ruined city of Jerash that this site just north of Amman pulls in almost as many visitors as the legendary rock-cut temples at Petra. Yep, this medley of towering colonnades and old forums, fascinating temples turned to Byzantine churches, and great plazas is hailed as perhaps the most amazing Roman provincial city still on the planet today. "
Wadi Rum,"Sun-scorched and glowing deep orange and red under the Arabian sun, the breathtaking reaches of the Wadi Rum of southern Jordan are surely one of the most awesome natural wonders in the region. Carved from the rocky limestone escarpments that rise and fall dramatically on the eastern fringes of Aqaba, the famous valley is quintessential Jordanian backcountry. Huge bluffs of rock-ribbed mountains loom on the horizon; mythic petroglyphs from ancient Nabatean peoples hide in the nooks and crannies; camels groan, and climbers swing tenuously from ropes around the hoodoos. It&#8217;s hardly a surprise that this was chosen as the backdrop to one Lawrence of Arabia back in 1962! "
Dead Sea,"The Dead Sea carves its way through the heartlands of the Middle Eastern Levant. The lowest and most salty of the world&#8217;s ocean water bodies, it&#8217;s encircled by rising mountains and ochre-hued sand dunes, all of which reflect majestically upon the surface as the Arabian sun beats down. Today, the whole area on the Jordanian banks (the western side is over the border in Israel) comes dotted with beaches and resort hotels, while the south of the sea is taken over with interesting mineral evaporation pools, built for the harvesting of carnallite and potassium. The favorite activity though? Well, that&#8217;s surely lazing on the surface of the water, where the high saline density keeps travelers afloat like logs! "
Aqaba,"Aqaba is Jordan&#8217;s gateway to the Red Sea. It buts up to the out-and-out resort town of Eilat in Israel across the border, and crowns the tip of the salty water with a medley of palm-spotted promenades and yellow sand beaches. Today, widespread redevelopment projects, and the raising of uber-luxurious resort hotels at Tala Bay just to the south, are converting Aqaba into the perfect seaside escape in the Middle East. You can tour the ancient ruins of Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan, see the date trees of the Shatt Al-Ghandour, or do what most do: go underwater on a SCUBA excursion to see the multi-colored reefs that fringe the submarine beds all around. "
Mujib Nature Reserve,"This vast swathe of north-west Jordan promises some seriously breathtaking backcountry, complete with winding river valleys and dust-caked gorges, steep-sided valleys sculpted over the centuries and oodles of hidden walkways chiseled out of the rocks. It&#8217;s known as the lowest nature reserve on the globe, and slopes down slowly to the saline waters of the Dead Sea. "
Dana Nature Reserve,"Go back in time with a trip to the rugged lands of the Dana Nature Reserve. This sweeping dash of carved valleys and rock-ribbed hills, scrub-dressed mountains and chiseled peaks topped with crumbling rocks, is not only Jordan&#8217;s largest protected area, but also offers a glimpse at the age-old lifestyles of the Middle Eastern folk who&#8217;ve made their home here. You can bed down in drystone huts in the ancient villages, or opt to camp under the stars, all before days of hiking through the dusty canyons and spotting rare Nubian ibexes on the ridges. It&#8217;s wonderful stuff for the outdoorsy traveler. "
Madaba,"The old, old city of Madaba can be found clinging to the edge of the famous King&#8217;s Highway that weaves through the dusty desert hills and the very historic heart of Jordan. Dominated by its glorious, gold-gilded mosque and collection of spiked minarets, the town also hides some awesome ancient mosaics that date from the Umayyad era. There are wondrous Byzantine artworks lurking in the alcoves and chapels of the Orthodox Saint George Cathedral too, not to mention a clutch of old Roman ruins peppering the town. You&#8217;ll also be able to sample spice-packed Jordanian mezze and smoky shisha in the fading Ottoman houses along the main drag. "
Ajloun Castle,"Dominating the green and undulating hills of northern Jordan, the historic town of Ajloun is now just a smattering of individual villages and hamlets. All of these smaller settlements are glued together by the soaring rises of the famous Ajloun Castle, which is by far the main reason most folk flock to these parts. This mighty citadel of the Muslim dynasties of old sits in pride of place, on the ridges of Jabal Ajlun above the wadis that surround the peak. It’s now possible to hike up to the old gateways and pass into the interior courtyards. Within is a comprehensive exhibition that chronicles the many masters the castle has had over the centuries. "
Irbid,"Irbid has thrived thanks to its hugely prestigious university – the acclaimed Yarmouk University – and a whole host of other well-known higher education facilities besides. Consequently, the vibe here is undeniably lively and youthful, and the folk of this bustling northern city are proud of their forward-thinking, more off-the-wall reputation. "
Zarqa,"Okay, so Zarqa hardly has the totemic archaeological ruins or the awesome historical monuments of the biblical proportions found elsewhere in Jordan, but there&#8217;s something else that attracts travelers to this down-to-earth exclave of Amman: a rough, lived-in feel that oozes the modern energy of the Middle East. Over the years, the town of Zarqa has become subsumed by the growing tendrils of the capital, but it&#8217;s also managed to retain its blue-collar character, and there are now oodles of bazaars and markets, interesting little local food shops, teahouses and more to explore between the traffic-crammed alleys. "
"Ma&#8217;an, Jordan","Another of the aged stopovers on the bends of the King&#8217;s Highway, Ma&#8217;an now straddles the divide between the old and the new. To the south of the dusty, sun-scorched city in the desert that can be seen today, the remains of a much older settlement can still be found. It&#8217;s thought that these date all the way back to the times of the Nabateans, and Ma&#8217;an formed an outpost away from Petra and the capital. "
Shobak Castle,"Surrounded by endless peaks and troughs of dry-mud hills, peppered with the occasional scraggy scrub and hardy acacia tree, the ancient ruins at Shobak are another spot perfect for the budding history buff traveling to Jordan. Known – appropriately – as just the Shobak Castle, these great palisades and arched gates of old now stand crumbling and cracking on the edge of the beautiful Dana Reserve. They aren&#8217;t much visited by tourists, but offer a unique insight into the fortification structures of the European crusaders of the 11th and 12th centuries. Expect winding tunnels and hidden dungeons aplenty. "
Derawan Island,"Derawan Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Indonesia and lies off the coast of the main island of Kalimantan.

It is also the home of sun bears, slow lorises, deer, and orangutans. "

White Mountain Kalimantan,"White Mountain, or Gunung Putih in Indonesian, is located in the Bulungan Regency and is one of the most important peaks in Tanjung Palas. The reason why people flock here is to hike to the peak of the mountain, and from here you can enjoy clear views across the surrounding countryside.

You can explore the area around the mouth of the cave and there are some 42 spotlights inside that will take you part of the way inside the main chamber. "

Each year there is the Amelia Earhart festival, where residents continue her brave legacy. "
Cottonwood Falls,"Cottonwood Falls makes the perfect escape away from any semblance of stress or busyness. This small town in Chase County is surrounded by rolling hills, a thriving songbird population, and the Cottonwood River. Residents of the area take pride in maintaining the peaceful, pristine feel to the region. Tourists can spend their time at restorative retreats or head out for non-stop action. No matter what travel style you have, you’ll feel comfortable in Cottonwood Falls. While in Cottonwood Falls, go for a scenic walk through the Flint Hills, dine at the local eateries, and browse the folk-art galleries. There are also a handful of specialty boutique stores to browse in between time spent relaxing and exploring. "
"Courthouse, Paola","Paola is a small town with a thriving community with a beautiful Historic Downtown Park Square. This square surrounded by Victorian architecture has an interesting and varied history. Over the years, it’s been a main gathering place for Native American tribes, horse racing track, parade and circus area, and now it’s still a wonderful place to hang out. Visitors can browse the many specialty boutique shops in the Paola business district or head to the outskirts to fish, camp, swim, and explore. Being just twenty minutes from Kansas City, Paola is a wonderful day or half day trip. "
"Dalton Defenders Museum, Coffeyville","Coffeyville is one small town that’s always had a lot of heart. Back in the mid 1800s, a group of bandits known as the Dalton boys was causing chaos in the nearby small towns, robbing banks, small shops, and citizens. Coffeyville staged a shootout and shot the outlaws dead. Afterwards, this small town became known as the “town that stopped the Daltons.” A fun exhibit about the scene is now at the Dalton Defenders Museum. Today, Coffeyville has a handful of fun attractions that are a must-visit when tourists come to town. Sites like the Brown Mansion, Midland Theater, and the Walter Johnson Park Campground are interesting stops spread between the town’s many public parks. "
Thomas County Courthouse,"Colby is well known as being an oasis on the plains of Kansas, where you can enjoy small-town living surrounded by endless fields of wind-blown grass. For those who grew up reading novels by Laura Ingalls Wilder, there is the Prairie Museum of Art and History to browse. You can easily spend your days relaxing and taking in the experience of true country living. Colby also hosts Pickin’ on the Plains, a gathering of incredible bluegrass musicians who come from all around the region to perform folk tunes and melodies for anyone who wants to listen. Travelers on a budget will also score sweet deals at the Southwind Antique Mall. "
Canterbury,"As beautiful as it is significant, Canterbury is a university crammed with history. It is the seat of the British Isles&#8217; first diocese, founded in the 6th century. The Archbishop of Canterbury remains one of the most influential public figures in England. The magnificent Norman and gothic cathedral is the showpiece of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was the scene of one of the pivotal moments in English medieval history: The murder of the Archbishop Thomas Beckett by supporters of King Henry II at the altar in 1170. There&#8217;s much to keep you enthralled in Canterbury, whether it&#8217;s Roman mosaics, the ruins of the castle and abbey, the city walls or the bulky Westgate, the biggest medieval city gate in England. "
Dover Castle,"This town has always been the entranceway to the British Isles from continental Europe, and is the main ferry port for crossings from France and Belgium. Approaching from the water, the first thing you see are those exalted white chalk cliffs. On land you can take a memorable walk along the grassy cliff-tops, on a route that will get you to Kingsdown eight miles away. As the closest port to France, the town needed to be fortified, and Dover Castle took its current form in the 12th century, during the reign of Henry II. There&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of history on this site from the Roman Lighthouse (one of England&#8217;s oldest buildings), to the 18th century artillery emplacements and the secret Second World War tunnels. "
Ramsgate,"As with six other beaches within a brief drive, Ramsgate Sands is a Blue Flag beach traced by a promenade and cliffs. When the weather&#8217;s good there&#8217;s all the nostalgic treats of an English seaside resort, and in winter and autumn it&#8217;s a brooding scene for invigorating walks. Ramsgate has the distinction of being the only Royal Harbour, and this is best seen from the long piers that protect it from the open sea and give it an almost-Mediterranean accent on the hottest days in summer. Also a must is a descent into the Ramsgate Tunnels, deep air-raid shelters dug for the Second World War and now open for tours. "
Broadstairs,"With the advent of steam power and railways in the 19th century Londoners were able to get to Broadstairs in a matter of hours, and they came for the sea air and seven bays of inviting golden sand. Charles Dickens chose Broadstairs for his holidays and wrote David Copperfield at Bleak House on the cliff above Viking Bay and with views of the North Foreland chalk headland. On sunny days Broadstairs is still the Thanet&#8217;s best option for a day at the seaside, thanks to its historic high street with independent shops and the retro charm of old-school holiday amenities like beach huts, a bandstand and 50s-style ice cream parlours. "
Sandwich,"Like Dover, Sandwich was one of the Cinque Ports, a confederation of five medieval towns on the Kent and Sussex coast that cooperated for trade and defence. And there are lots of hints about Sandwich&#8217;s history around the town today, like gates from the old town fortifications, two stunning almshouses and a handful of pubs that have been serving customers for hundreds of years. Rural ways of life in days gone by are explained at the White Mill, a windmill built in the 1700s and fully restored. And a few minutes outside the town is Richborough Castle, a ruined but compelling Roman and Saxon fortress and the mooted landing site for the Claudian Invasion in AD 43. "
View from Rochester Castle,"If you&#8217;re familiar with the early chapters of Charles Dickens&#8217; Great Expectations then you&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;ve read about the muddy Medway River, even if the author never mentioned it by name. Dickens grew up close by in Chatham and moved back to Gad&#8217;s Hill Place, a mansion just outside Rochester later in life, where he passed away. But Rochester has more going for it; the castle has a 12th-century keep with walls and towers that are almost complete despite their great age. It&#8217;s a breathtaking sight, equalled by the Norman and Gothic Rochester Cathedral, which was built in the 11th century but is the seat of a diocese that goes right back to 604, making it the second-oldest in England after Canterbury. "
Chatham Historic Dockyard,"Around a meander in the Medway, Chatham is a town soaked with naval history. From 1567 to the 1980s the Royal Navy Dockyard was here, and is now conserved as the Chatham Historic Dockyard. If you&#8217;re inspired by the age of sail the dockyard will blow your mind, not just because of heritage ships that you can board, like HMS Gannet, but for facilities such as the Grade I-listed ropery, a 364-metre-long building that still produces rope commercially. A nice complement to the dockyard is Fort Amherst, constructed in 1756 to protect the dockyard in case of a French invasion. "
Royal Tunbridge Wells,"In the High Weald, a long ridge of craggy sandstone, Royal Tunbridge Wells is a moneyed town welcoming wealthy guests and residents since the 1600s, when they first arrived for the curative waters. That sandstone geology is clear in the strange rock formations, Wellington Rocks on Tunbridge Common, and the sheer High Rocks just outside the town. There are gardens in distinguished estates to idle in, like the house-less Dunorlan Park, Calverly Grounds and Scotney Castle, all as stately as you&#8217;d hope. The local landscapes are out of a picture book,  all hop farms, duck ponds, village greens, pub gardens and oast houses. "
Knole House,"Just outside the M25, Sevenoaks is Kent&#8217;s first tourist destination for people travelling from London, and in turn has many residents who work in London. Right in the north downs the local countryside is dappled with pretty villages like Otford and Shoreham, and the abundance of woodland gives you plenty of choices for walks. But the main landmark is Knole House, a National Trust property and one of England&#8217;s most revered stately homes. It&#8217;s a marvellous gabled 15th and 16th century building in four square kilometres of forest and open parkland where deer herds graze. The house is huge considering its age, with more than 300 rooms and seven courtyards. "
"Deal, Kent","There&#8217;s much to love about the seafront at Deal, with rows of whitewashed cottages and grander, flat-fronted houses from the 17th and 18th century. You can cut down little lanes with old gaslights and find English seaside staples like chippies and shops selling rock candy. There&#8217;s also military history in the town, at Deal Castle, a Tudor 16th-century artillery fort with 66 firing positions and a low profile to make it less of a target. Walmer Castle, further south has a similar outline and was built in the same period during the rule of Henry VIII. The pebble beach goes on for miles, running in front of the neighbouring towns of Walmer and Kingsdown, and has a belt of heathland behind where wild fennel grows by the beachfront track. "
Whitstable,"Whitstable is a seaside town full of character and with an authentic feel created by its fishing industry. The local speciality is oysters, which have been harvested in the local waters for 2,000 years. This activity took a bit of a hit in the post-war years, but has bounced back and is honoured every July at the Whitstable Oyster Festival. Integral to any visit should be an amble around the working fishing harbour and market, and to get a table at one of the superb fish restaurants in the town. Pebble beaches are also on either side of the harbour, and the Old Neptune that rare thing: A pub directly on the beach. "
Folkestone,"An offbeat relic from Folkestone&#8217;s seaside glory days is the Leas Lift, a short funicular railway transporting you from the seafront to the promenade atop the Leas cliff and installed in 1885. It&#8217;s a fixture of the town, and is maintained by a local non-profit organisation. You can see as far as France from the Leas Promenade on a clear day, and the area at the bottom is the Lower Leas Coastal Park, including the beach with its colourful painted huts. If you have a thing for Georgian and Victorian architecture you&#8217;ll adore Folkestone&#8217;s many whitewashed townhouses. And the Creative Quarter is a quaint cobblestone street home to more than 100 artists, with galleries, studios and independent shops and cafes. "
Aylesford,"If for nothing else you should come this village outside Maidstone for the view from the south bank of the Medway, where the 14th-century bridge spans the river and is framed by rows of tall brick and timber houses and the tower of St. Peter and Paul&#8217;s Church. On the high street you&#8217;ll pass medieval almshouses and the beautiful George House, which was once an inn serving horse-drawn coach travellers. Aylesford Priory, also known as the Friars, is unique in that it is was bought back by the Carmelites in the 1940s, 400 years after the  monasteries were dissolved. The peaceful grounds are free and always open, and you can also have tea and cake at the tearooms seven days a week. "
Tenterden,"A well to-do country town, Tenterden is a pretty slice of rural England, with a medieval church, a sweet little high street, old pubs, and is even on the Kent &amp; East Sussex steam railway. In the vicinity you can go for a tour at a brewery or cider press and even see a winery in action. In the village of Small Hythe, close to Tenterden  is Smallhythe Place, a charming 15th or 16th-century half-timbered house. The property is now managed by the National Trust and was home to the Victorian actor Ellen Terry for almost 30 years. Some of her possession are shown inside, like a letter from Oscar Wilde, a monocle belonging to Sir Arthur Sullivan and stage costumes from her career. "
Ashford,"At the centre of the county, people come to Ashford from the villages and towns around for its shopping. The Ashford Designer Outlet is probably the most famous destination here, with big reductions on luxury fashion brands. Ashford is also at a nexus point between England and France, as this is the last stop for the Eurostar before it crosses the channel or terminates in London at St. Pancras. Minutes from Ashford  you have the sublime Godinton House, a gabled Jacobean stately home in flower gardens and with a treasured collection of porcelain. And for walks, the Kent Downs are just north of Ashford, and you can easily get onto long distance paths like the Stour Valley Walk and the North Downs Way. "
Dog Slaughter Falls,"Perfect for a family hike, Dog Slaughter Falls is one of Kentucky&#8217;s best known natural sights. The 15-foot waterfall is one of the most impressive in the state and great views of the falls are provided from the Dog Slaughter Falls Trail. The two-mile trek is rated at moderate and is an ideal spot for dog-walking. Hemlock and rhododendrons are among the plants visitors can expect to see on the trail, but Dog Slaughter Falls is without a doubt the highlight of any trip to this part of Kentucky. "
The Appalachians,"Once upon a time the Appalachians were as massive as the Rocky Mountains and the Alps, but over the years they have been slowly eroded away to their present state. Extending for almost 2,000 miles, the mountain range acts as a natural barrier between the interior lowlands of North America and the eastern coastal plain. In Kentucky itself the peaks of the Appalachians are not particularly high, but the terrain is regarded as very rugged and is for experienced hikers only. The views from the top are still awe-inspiring, regardless of the hills&#8217; lack of height and physical stature. "
Breaks Interstate Park,"Known as the Grand Canyon of the South, Breaks Interstate Park spans the border of Kentucky and Virginia. The park is famous for being home to the deepest gorge east of the Mississippi, with Virginia State Route 80 the best way to reach the area. Explorer Daniel Boone is credited with being the first to discover the beauty of Breaks Interstate Park and today there are dozens of lodges where people can stay to appreciate the sights of the area up close. "
No Image Available,"Despite being only small at eight acres, Fairmount Falls is home to an incredible 40-foot waterfall that draws visitors from many, many miles. Easily reachable within minutes from the Gene Snyder and Bardstown Road interchange, this superb Kentucky landmark is accessible by permit only to protect the natural landscape. The best time to visit is either in spring or in winter, as this is when the flow of water at Fairmount Falls is at its most impressive. "
Gallatin County Courthouse,"A great spot to visit for people interested in learning about the Civil War, Gallatin County is also where some of Kentucky&#8217;s most beautiful places are located. The historically important county may be the smallest in Kentucky by area, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in its own unique charm. Sparta is one of the Gallatin County communities that are well worth visiting, as this is where the Kentucky Speedway is held. "
Kentucky Lake,"Kentucky Lake is one of the largest man-made artificial lakes in the United States, holding up to 4,008,000 acre-feet of water. But, more importantly, the sunsets over the lake are out of this world. Bass and crappie fishing are popular in Kentucky Lake and its neighbor Lake Barkley, with the land between the two lakes housing an elk and bison prairie, which is free to enter and is open all year round. Kenlake State Resort Park can also be found to the west of Kentucky Lake, with Kentucky Dam Village State Resort Park to the north. "
George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge,"The George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge, which Kentucky locals call Second Street Bridge, provides a crossing over the Ohio River between Louisville and Jeffersonville. The bridge famously features in a scene from the movie Stripes, where the character played by Bill Murray gets out of a cab and throws his keys into the river. The bridge is also the centerpoint of the annual Thunder Over Louisville event, where a waterfall of fireworks lights up the sky. The bridge is named in honour of the founder of Louisville, George Rogers Clark. "
Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth Cave National Park is the longest known cave system in the world, with more than 400 miles of caves having been plotted to date. Keen explorers should definitely take some time to check out Mammoth Cave and its surroundings, as new caves are regularly being discovered. A United Nations World Heritage site, Mammoth Cave attracts around 400,000 tourists every year. During tours, rangers typically turn off their guiding lights, making Mammoth Cave National Park one of the few places in the world where people can experience the wonder of true darkness. "
Perryville,"Perryville is another must-visit Kentucky location for people who are interested in Civil War history. The Battle of Perryville &#8211; which is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Chaplin Hills &#8211; is regarded as one of the Civil War&#8217;s bloodiest battles. Today, Perryville is a National Historic Landmark area and it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some of the first buildings to be built in Perryville still stand today, even though they are now close to 200 years old. "
Kentucky State Capitol,"Home to Kentucky&#8217;s government, the state capitol is located in the city of Frankfort. The state capitol building houses a glorious marble staircase, making it one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture in the whole state. The staircases are without a doubt one of the main reasons to visit the state capitol, with the marble interiors having been inspired by the Opera Garnier in Paris. Guided tours of the Kentucky State Capitol are available and come highly recommended, with the First Lady Doll Collection among the most noteworthy attractions housed in the building. "
Pinnacles Of Berea,"The Pinnacles of Berea provide not just some of the best hiking trails in the state, but in the whole of the South. The main trail consists of a loop 6.6 miles long, which typically takes around three to four hours to complete depending on your hiking experience and fitness levels. Beautiful wild flowers are present throughout the trail, which is accessible from April until October and is open to dog-walkers too. Check out the West Pinnacle and Indian Fort Outlook for some of the best views of the stunning scenery at the Pinnacles of Berea. "
Ig South Fork National River And Recreation Area,"Established in 1974, visiting the Big South Fork National River is a must for anyone exploring Kentucky. Hiking, horseback riding, fishing, hunting and stargazing are all popular activities at Big South Fork, which also hosts a huge collection of natural bridges that are well worth exploring and provide some fantastic opportunities for photography. Wilderness lodge Charit Creek Lodge is among the many places people can stay while visiting the Big South Fork National River. "
Red River Gorge,"Located within the Daniel Boone National Forest, the Red River Gorge is famous for its natural stone arches. The gorge is also designated as a national geological area due to its sandstone cliffs and unique rock formations. The Red River Gorge has developed into one of the world&#8217;s hottest rock climbing spots, with climbing enthusiasts giving the area the nickname &#8216;Red&#8217;. The Red River Gorge&#8217;s Sky Bridge features in the 1955 movie The Kentuckian, which starred Burt Lancaster. "
"Newport, Kentucky","Once known as Sin City due to its many casinos, Newport today is a much more family-friendly destination, with the Newport on the Levee entertainment complex one of the busiest leisure and retail sites in the whole of Kentucky. Newport is also home to one of the 20 World Peace Bells. In fact, the Newport bell was the largest swinging bell in the world between 2000 and 2006. Local places worth visiting include Newport Aquarium, music venue Thompson House, the Northern Kentucky Gambling Museum, General James Taylor Park and Newport Southbank Bridge. "
Cumberland Falls,"Cumberland Falls is sometimes called the Niagara of the South or the Little Niagara, with the falls the main attraction of the Cumberland Falls State Resort Park. Visitors should try to time their visit to Cumberland Falls when there is a full moon and a clear sky, as this is when a gorgeous elusive lunar rainbow &#8211; also known as a moonbow &#8211; can often be spotted. The arch of white light that makes up the moonbow is an unforgettable sight and one of the most beautiful things in Kentucky. "
"Wolf Creek Dam, Kentucky","Wolf Creek may be more famous as an Australian horror movie, but in Kentucky the name refers to a huge dam in Russell County. The area is also home to Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, which is free for visitors, with the Visitor/Environmental Education Center open 364 days a year. More than 100,000 people visit Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery every year and the local area is home to some of the state&#8217;s most special scenery as well. "
Kentucky River,"The Kentucky River flows all the way through the state, starting in Lee County at Beattyville before windings its slow route through the state&#8217;s mountains. The river takes in the Daniel Boone National Forest and flows through Boonesborough and Irvine before eventually linking up with the Ohio River. Perhaps the best place in the state to experience the magnificence of the Kentucky River is at the Kentucky River Palisades, between Frankfort and Clays Ferry in Madison County. This is where a series of gargantuan steep gorges as long as 100 miles long can be viewed. "
"Lexington, Kentucky","Known as the Horse Capital of the World, Lexington is a must-visit for anyone travelling to Kentucky. The second largest city in Kentucky, Lexington is home to a huge array of historic sites, such as the Waveland State Historic Site and Kentucky statesman Henry Clay&#8217;s Ashland estate. But if horses are your thing, Lexington is a fantastic place to visit. The American Saddle Horse Museum and the Kentucky Horse Park are both worth checking out, while there are few places better to watch racing than at the Keeneland Race Course. The Festival of the Bluegrass also takes place in Lexington every June and hikers should head to the Raven Run Nature Sanctuary. "
"Willett Distillery &#8211; Bardstown, Kentucky","Bardstown was described by Rand McNally and USA Today as the Most Beautiful Small Town in America and it is hard to argue with that description. The county seat of Nelson County, Bardstown is famous around the world for its bourbon, while its eclectic shops are well worth exploring too. There are five bourbon distilleries in Bardstown, with Heaven Hill, Maker’s Mark and Jim Beam all based in the area. The Oscar Getz Museum of Whiskey History is among the top attractions Bardstown boasts, the Kentucky Railway Museum. The Civil War Museum in Bardstown is one of the biggest in the United States and tourists should also go to Wickland, a private residence that three Kentucky Governors have lived in, which offers public tours. "
Maasai Mara,"Home to perhaps the single most famous safari park in the world (sorry Kruger), this relatively small national reserve magnesites thousands of travelers to the reaches of East Africa every year. It&#8217;s bordered to the south (and immediately contiguous with) Tanzania&#8217;s acclaimed Serengeti National Park, and displays the quintessential backcountry of the East African Rift: undulating savannah plains peppered with galloping zebra herds; swaying grasslands punctuated with the lanky stalks of giraffes; meadows of topi and waterholes dotted with cape buffalo. Safari is – of course – the biggest pull, with countless people heading in for The Great Migration and to see the fabled Big Five of African mammals. "
Lamu Island,"Ringed by sandbanks, bobbing dhows, mangrove swamps and the lapping waters of the Indian Ocean on the eastern edge of Kenya, little Lamu Island still plays host to one of the most historically rich towns in the nation. Named – appropriately – Lamu Old Town, this historic port of whitewashed facades and tropical timber wood houses is tagged by UNESCO for its exposition of traditional Swahili building methods. But that’s not it, because the villages of Shela and Matondoni further along the coast of Lamu also boast a series of fascinating ports and mosques from centuries gone by, while the age-old celebrations of Mawlid are a must for any culture vultures! "
Amboseli National Park,"Amboseli lives up to its reputation as one of the crème de la crème of East African safari parks, and not least of all with that fine location below the colossal outline of none other than Mount Kilimanjaro! In the shadow of that snow-topped massif – the highest on the continent – this protected reserve spreads out in a patchwork of dusty plains and savannahs, fields of curious sulphur spouts and riparian wetlands all trodden by some of the largest elephant herds in the country. Today, wildlife lovers flock here to safari and see the great galumphing beasts next to cheetahs, wildebeest, giraffes, zebra and more! "
Nairobi,"Sprawling, steel-clad Nairobi isn&#8217;t the prettiest of African cities at first glance, granted. But there&#8217;s real charm and energy to be found in this nigh on four-million-strong capital in the southern heart of Kenya for sure. For starters, the town is famed as the only great metropolis with a bona fide safari park smack bang within city limits – just check out the Nairobi National Park, where giraffes meet cheetahs against the meanders of the Mbagathi River. Add to that a series of great central markets that bubble with East African hotpots and foods, along with one of Kenya&#8217;s best nightlife scenes, and bingo: you&#8217;ve got yourself a town that&#8217;s really worth the stopover! "
Hell&#8217;s Gate National Park,"Sat midway between the city of Nairobi and the backcountry town of Nakuru, Hell&#8217;s Gate covers a humble 68 square kilometers in the midst of southern Kenya. A place of real natural beauty, it&#8217;s defined by startling and unforgettable rock formations that rise like splinters from the scrub-dressed ground. Considered by many to have been the inspiration for the Disney film The Lion King, the area has high escarpments and deep valleys carved through its terrain, each bearing curious monikers like Fischer&#8217;s Tower and the great Embarta. Between the gorges and canyons, you can expect to see wildebeest and vultures, African buffalo and Thomson&#8217;s gazelle, not to mention packs of lions to boot! "
"Tsavo East National Park, Kenya","One of the oldest and largest national parks in all of East Africa, the great stretches of Tsavo East rarely fail to top charts of the finest safari destinations on the planet. They can be found cascading down from the sun-baked highlands of the Chyulu Hills that straddle the border with Tanzania to the south; a mosaic of swaying savannah grasses and red-hued rocks that rise like escarpments from the dusty, arid grounds. The eastern edge of the park is delineated by the flow of the Athi River, which gives way to the great stones of Yatta – one of the largest lava channels in the world. And then there are the animals: everything from white-tailed mongooses to cape buffalo, ground pangolins to cheetahs! "
"Fort Jesus, Mombasa (Kenya)","With overtones as exotic as nearby Zanzibar and a history as deep as any of East Africa&#8217;s cities, Mombasa is an enigmatic and wonderful place to visit. Swahili roots and traditions die hard, even after the influence of the erstwhile Portuguese and Arabic rulers raised colonial edifices and grand mosques between the streets. Take some time to wander the European-flavoured Old Town, sample the spicy Indian-influenced curries and take in the energy of Mombasa port. But don&#8217;t linger too long, because the beaches await, going from the shimmering white stretches along Bamburi to the palm tree groves of Shanzu! "
Malindi,"Ah Malindi: a town of tin-shack homes and old mosque towers from centuries gone by, where the sea has never been so warm and the sand has never been so white! Yep, this humble little trading town on Kenya&#8217;s Indian Ocean coast has risen and risen in recent decades to become the favourite choice of European and American visitors looking to taste the sun and salt water of East Africa. Monuments to the great Portuguese explore Vasco da Gama Pillar still mark the center of the place – a testimony to its long past – while strips of palm-backed beaches and resorts, pretty piazzas and even pizza restaurants bring in the biggest crowds. "
Samburu National Reserve,"The Samburu National Reserve marks the very heart of Kenya as a whole. Hundreds of miles from the coast, and just edging up to the rising highlands that define East Africa, the area gets its lifeblood from the meanders of the trickling Ewaso Ng&#8217;iro, which drops down this way from the ice-caked top of Mount Kenya itself. The terrain is defined by flat-topped acacia trees and the occasional riparian oases of palms, while the wildlife includes lions and gazelles, Tanzanian cheetahs, waterbucks, crocodiles and olive baboons. "
Lake Nakuru,"Lake Nakuru now sits at the heart of its very own national park. Just a small speck of blue on the Kenyan map, this curious body of water rises above the Great Rift Valley from between the acacia groves and meadows that surround it. It&#8217;s famed primarily for its truly kaleidoscopic array of birdlife, which is defined by the pinkish glow of flamingos for most of the year. Head up to the high-perched lookout points of Baboon Cliff for some dramatic views of the area, before hitting the winding dirt tracks that ring the water&#8217;s edge to spot Eastern black rhinos, baboons and countless migrating birds alike. "
Herders with their cows in Laikipia,"The rise and rise of the Laikipia District as one of Kenya&#8217;s prime ecotourist hotspots has defied all expectations. Without any totemic national parks or game reserves, the region entered the scene with just the pulls of its natural backcountry. And as soon as the tour companies caught on to the unspoilt beauties of the sweeping green highlands and hills that rise and fall here, the rest was history. Today, oodles of safari folk flock come to enjoy off-the-beaten-track wildlife spotting, with destinations like the Sosian Game Ranch, the Ol Ari Nyiro Conservancy and others boasting the likes of Grevy’s zebras, wild dogs and uber-rare black rhinos. "
Lake Naivasha,"Like Nakuru, Lake Naivasha&#8217;s little brother, located just to the north-west, this mirror-like body of water is one of the real jewels of the Kenyan Rift. Shining in hues of sky-blue beneath the red rock ridges of the aforementioned Hell&#8217;s Gate park, the spot is widely famed for its thriving birdlife. For example, there are uber-rare bearded vultures to see, along with ospreys, hawks and eagles. Add to that the geothermal power plants and geological phenomenon that occur in the nearby mountains, and it&#8217;s easy to see why Naivasha is now considered such a fascinating place to visit! "
Kisumu,"With one foot in Lake Victoria and the other on the great highways that lead east to Nairobi, Mombasa and the port towns of the Indian Ocean, it&#8217;s hardly surprising that Kisumu cut its teeth in the mercantile trade. However, things have ebbed and flowed a lot in the last couple of decades, with the steam boats and transports dropping off for some time. Revival is now in the works, but Kisumu has a regained respect for its historical traditions and natural attractions too. So, forget the great freights and oil pipes, and look instead to the biodiversity of Dunga Beach, or the curious architecture of the Kisumu Town Clock in the center of the city. "
Nyeri,"Nyeri is very much the self-proclaimed gateway to the Central Highlands of Kenya. At heart, it&#8217;s a dusty transport hub of a town, with purring scooters and rickshaws moving through the square-cut blocks and between the low-rise marketplaces. However, its enviable location on the very edge of the Aberdare Mountains, within reach of the Aberdare National Park (home to leopards, African wild dogs, giant forest hogs, cape buffalos, rhinos and more), Mount Suswa and the South-western Mau Reserve makes it a real magnet for outdoorsy types! "
Marsabit,"Rising in a medley of ramshackle tin homes and lean-to timber shacks from the midst of the great Kenyan deserts in the north, this largely untrodden town is one for the conservation buffs and ethical tourists. It&#8217;s currently the focus of a number of humanitarian missions, which are attempting to provide schooling, clean water and the like to the local tribal communities. More than 422 kilometers from Nairobi, the town is far-flung to say the least, but that means an authentic view of Kenyan life, and a chance to see the wilder (if that&#8217;s possible!), more arid and unexplored section of this popular East African country. "
Lancaster Castle,"Although just a little city and easy to traverse on foot, Lancaster&#8217;s historic ties to the British throne (Queen Elizabeth II is the Duke of Lancaster) makes it an exciting place to explore. It&#8217;s also very attractive, with lots of proud Georgian houses from the 1700s, particularly around the castle and on the banks of the Lune River. And as for that castle, it&#8217;s one of the region&#8217;s most treasured historic monuments, suffused with almost a thousand years of tales and intrigue. Go in for a tour, but don&#8217;t neglect the Lancashire City Museum, the Lancaster Canal or the haunting Ashton Memorial high on a hilltop in Williamson Park. "
Blackpool,"The coastal town of Blackpool is pretty much the model for an English seaside resort and is one of the country&#8217;s most beloved domestic holiday destinations. A fixture since 1894, and one of the things that helped put the town on the map, is the 158-metre-high Blackpool Tower. It was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, and has an observation deck  140 metres up and a glorious Victorian ballroom. The sandy beaches were cleaned up in the 1980s and Blackpool South Beach meets the exacting Blue Flag standards for hygiene. There&#8217;s way more in Blackpool than we can list here, but the Pleasure Beach amusement park and the Illuminations lights festival in the autumn months are extra incentive to come. "
Garstang,"An adorable market town, Garstang was mentioned in the 11th-century Domesday book and has a weekly market that has been running since 1310. Just west of the Forest of Bowland, this is prime walking country. Set a course for the ruins of Greenhaigh Castle on elevated ground over Garstang. There isn&#8217;t a great deal remaining of this sandstone building, but the decayed remnants have their own fragile beauty. Up here there&#8217;s a great perspective of the town and countryside, while the Lancaster Canal crosses the town and runs all the way to Kendal. Hire a longboat or walk the towpath for to experience Lancashire&#8217;s wild moorland and fells at a lighter gradient. "
Lytham St Annes,"A conurbation of two coastal towns a few miles down the coast from Blackpool, Lytham St Annes is an ideal antidote to its glitzier neighbour. Amusements and theatre shows are replaced by more tranquil forms of enjoyment: The marshes on the Ribble Estuary and 80 hectares of sand dunes in the resort provide a wintering habitat for more than 100,000 migratory birds. Golf is the sport of choice, and there are four courses, including the Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, which has hosted the prestigious Open Championship, the oldest of the four majors. St Annes is the seaside destination and is an understated Victorian resort, with a pier, gigantic beach and loads of period character. "
Burnley,"As a textile town in the 19th and 20th centuries, Burnley is a good place to delve a bit deeper into industrial times in Lancashire. The atmospheric Weavers&#8217; Triangle, with its workers&#8217; houses and cotton mills on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, is permeated with this history and you&#8217;ll get enthusiastic insights about these times at the visitors centre. There&#8217;s a more refined side to Burnley too, at Towneley Hall a sublime Elizabethan manor house in sprawling grounds and with a museum containing everything from traditional local furniture to pre-Raphaelite paintings. Burnley FC meanwhile is the overachieving local team, playing in the Premier League at Turf Moor one of the top flight&#8217;s last traditional grounds. "
Whalley Paris Church,"Crossing the river Calder with a stark majesty is the Whalley Viaduct, a titanic railway bridge built in the 1840s, 21 metres high and comprising 7,000,000 bricks. Go to view the spectral ruins of Whalley Abbey. This Cistercian monastery was founded in the 13th century but was divided up after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, The church and most of the monastic buildings were pulled down, but the dormitory is still there and is still used as a catholic place of worship. The Northwest Gatehouse is also mostly intact and has Grade-I listing. You&#8217;re in the scenic Ribble Valley in Whalley, and can hike up through woodland and pasture to the nearby Whalley Nab for a satisfying panorama of the village. "
Preston,"The story of the city of Preston is one echoed throughout the northwest: A small market town that grew rich and large from the cotton mills in the 1800s. This era was when Preston&#8217;s most imposing landmarks were created. Take the gothic revival Church of St Walburge, which has the tallest spire of any non-cathedral church in the country. Or there&#8217;s the classical purpose-built Harris Museum, with paintings by Lucien Freud and Stanley Spence, and the excellent Discover Preston section, guiding you through the city&#8217;s and region&#8217;s past back to prehistoric times. Rolling down to the north bank of the Ribble River are the joyous Avenham and Miller Parks, with a Japanese Garden and a grand stairway dominated by a statue of Edward Smith-Stanley, the MP for Preston and three-times the country&#8217;s Prime Minister. "
Morecambe,"A seaside town in the scenic bay of the same name, Morecambe means huge sandy beaches, kite-flying, chippies, ice cream parlours and the many other simple joys of a British coastal destination. One fabulous sight to take in is the breathtaking MIdland Hotel, an art deco masterwork built in 1933 and recently brought back to life. Morecambe has several cultural connections, as the playwright Alan Bennett based some of his works in the town. And if you have a thing for British comedy you&#8217;ll appreciate the statue of the performer Eric Morecambe, who is fondly remembered for the Morecambe and Wise double act in the 1970s. "
Chorley,"One of Lancashire&#8217;s cotton towns, Chorley&#8217;s skyline was a crowd of chimneys until the last decades of the 20th century, while the nearby collieries closed in the 1980s. The Industrial Revolution brought sudden growth to Chorley, but it had been an important town for centuries, with a market that goes back to the 15th century. Come to browse the stalls on Tuesdays and try a freshly-baked Chorley cake, shortcrust pastry with a currant filling. Astley Hall is owned by the town and is a sublime 17th century country house with a walled garden. And for fresh air, the sandstone peak of Rivington Pike climbs to 363 metres and is an amazing vantage point for the barren but enchanting moorland around the Rivington Reservoir. "
Poulton-le-Fylde,"It may be that you&#8217;d prefer a more placid and rural setting to retreat to during your trip to Blackpool. The pretty market town of Poulton-le-Fylde is ten minutes away and has a centre protected as a conservation area. At least 15 buildings in this little town have been listed, and some, like the Golden Ball pub, have been regional landmarks for as long as anyone can remember. Poulton is in an agricultural area, far from the coalfields and so was unaffected during the Industrial Revolution. Salad and vegetables are grown in the local countryside and sold at Monday&#8217;s weekly market. And while you&#8217;re on Market Square, look for the medieval whipping post and stocks, still in place though thankfully they haven&#8217;t been used recently! "
Darwen Moor,"Neighboured by tall hills, Darwen is a good shout for an outdoor holiday, with bike trails, footpaths and bridleways into the West Pennine Moors. The scenery is windswept and barren, but has an untamed appeal. These moors weren&#8217;t always accessible to the public, and that&#8217;s the story behind the Jubilee Tower. At the crest of the 372-metre Darwen Hill, this landmark was created to commemorate Victoria&#8217;s jubilee in 1897, but also to celebrate the reopening of historic rights of way, which had been blocked off by private landowners for much of the late-19th century. Up here drink in the vistas of Blackpool, the Isle of Man and Morecambe Bay. Also spend some time in the town, visiting the Victorian Market Hall, which has 130 stalls overflowing with great local produce. "
"Blackburn, England","A large town between Preston and Burnley, Blackburn is well-known for its historic cotton-weaving industry. This dates further back than in other towns in the county as Blackburn was settled by Flemish migrants who brought the trade with them in the 1300s. The Blackburn Museum &amp; Art Gallery, established in 1874, has curated a lot of this heritage, including the awesome Japanese Print Collection, as well as medieval manuscripts, fine arts and Egyptology collections. The other big claim to fame is the football team Blackburn Rovers, who won the Premier League in 1995. They are the bitter rivals of Burnley but currently languish in the second tier of English football. "
Ormskirk Church,"On Thursdays and Saturdays, the pedestrianised centre of Ormskirk bustles with shoppers at a market that got its charter in 1286. And the moment you see it you&#8217;ll know that the 12th-century Church of St. Peter and Paul is a bit of oddity: This is one of only three in Britain to have both a western tower and a spire. What&#8217;s inside is just as intriguing, as the church is the burial place of several Earls of Derby. Thomas Stanley changed sides in the Battle of Bosworth, accelerating Richard III&#8217;s defeat and death, while the royalist James Stanley was beheaded at the end of the Civil War. His head and body were buried in separate caskets. "
Carnforth Steam Museum,"A small town in northern Lancashire and close to the boundary with Cumbria, Carnforth&#8217;s reputation as a &#8220;railway town&#8221; was enshrined in 1945 when the classic movie Brief Encounter was shot at Carnforth Station by David Lean. You can go into the Heritage Centre to see reconstructed sets and artefacts from the steam age. You could also catch a steam train to Scarborough on the West Coast Line heritage railway, and get the luxury cream tea treatment in first class. Carnforth is a town for walkers, who can climb Warton Crag, a steep limestone hill, which has a breeding site for peregrine falcons. "
Heysham,"On Morecambe Bay, Heysham is the a ferry-port with traffic to and from Ireland and the Isle of Man. But there are lots of little things to hold your attention. High above Morcambe Bay are the atmospheric ruins of St Patrick&#8217;s Chapel, a Grade I-listed building from the 8th century. What makes this site so unusual is the presence of six tombs that were carved directly from the rock in the 1000s. Heysham is the only site in the UK with two functioning power stations, and you may as well embrace them: If you&#8217;re curious about nuclear energy then the EDF centre offers pre-booked tours. They&#8217;ll kit you out with safety gear like a hi-vis jacket, hardhat and safety glasses, and take you round the reactor, cooling systems and turbines. "
Vientiane,"Vientiane is the charming capital of Laos and even though this is technically a capital city, it still feels like a small town rather than anything else. Vientiane used to be a former French trading post during the colonial period, and as a result it has a delightful old French quarter than you can explore. As you walk around you will also find a plethora of French inspired architecture such as a Laotian version of the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris known as Patuxai. There are also other attractions that are well worth a visit such as sprawling local markets and temples like Wat Si Saket which is the oldest of its kind in Vientiane. "
Luang Prabang,If you are looking for the serene heart of Laos then you may want to travel to Luang Prabang which is a town that lies on the mighty Mekong and Khan rivers. The town is also known for its gorgeous little European style cafes which are located along the scenic river banks and this area is so delightful that it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You will also find gorgeous temples all over the town and if you like trekking then you can go out to the Kuang Si Waterfalls where you will find amazing azure cataracts that have deep pools which are perfect for bathing in. 
Vang Vieng,"Van Vieng sits between Vientiane and Luang Prabang and is one of the main backpacker locations in Laos. In the days of old this part of Laos had a rather wild reputation and a surprisingly vibrant nightlife scene, although now it has become a little more staid thanks to action taking by the local government to clean up its image. One of the main reasons to come to Van Vieng is to enjoy the tubing down the Nam Song River and you can take in the lush jungle scenery here at the same time. There are also other spots such as the Tham Phu Kham Cave which is known for its lagoon and bronze statue of the Buddha. "
Huay Xai,Huay Xai is located on the border between Laos and Thailand which is the reason that many people visit when they cross from one country to the other. It is also known however for its Mekong River cruises as you can take a boat from Huang Xai to Luang Prabang and for many visitors this is the highlight of a trip to Laos. It is also the gateway to Bokeo Nature Reserve which is known for its spectacular Gibbon Experience. 
Si Phan Don Islands,Laos is known for not having a coastline so it may sound strange to hear that it is the home of the Si Phan Don Islands which means ‘Four Thousand Islands’ in Lao. The islands are caused by the Mekong River dispersing close to the border between Laos and Cambodia which has created these amazing little islets. The islands vary in size which is great as you can choose some of the larger islands like Don Khon and Don Det if you want a little more nightlife and a wider range of accommodation options. You can also visit smaller and sleepier island like Don Khong if you really want to fall off the grid and get away from it all in Laos. 
Bokeo Nature Reserve,"The Bokeo Nature Reserve lies outside the town of Huay Xai and is a well known nature reserve that is known for its conservation work to protect black-cheeked gibbons which were rediscovered in 1997 after it was thought that they had become extinct. The park allows you to stay in tree houses which give you a bird’s eye view of the forest canopy and you can also partake in fun jungle activities such as swinging on a zip line As well as the famous gibbons, you will also find elephants, bears, tigers and buffalo in the park and keen bird watchers can check out hundreds of species of colorful avians. "
Nong Khiaw,Nong Khiaw is also known as Nong Kiau and is a pretty spot in Laos that is rapidly gaining a name for itself as one of the best places to visit in the country if you want to get away from it all. Here you will find some amazing trekking and hiking opportunities and you can spend time biking around the scenic villages here that surround the main town. Nong Khiaw also sits on the delightful Nam Ou River so you can take a boat trip here that you will let you take in all the scenery from the vantage point of the water. This part of the country is also surrounded by gorgeous karst formations and the limestone caves here such as the Pha Tok Caves are a great location for anyone who enjoys spelunking. 
Tham Kong Lo,Tham Kong Lo is the name for the Kong Lo Cave which is part of the wider Phu Hin Bun National Park. The park and cave sit along the Phu Hin Bun River and the central chamber is said to be one of the most spectacular in all of Southeast Asia. The cave is some 6.5 kilometers long and is 300 feet high and is known for its stunning jade-hued pools which are said to be the same color as the skin of the Hindu god Indra. The best way to check out the cave is to take a boat trip along the amazing chamber and enjoy the rock crystals and stalagmites and stalactites here. 
Rice Fields In Luang Namtha,"Luang Namtha is known for being the largest city in the northwest part of Laos and is famous for being a stop off point for anyone traveling between Laos and neighboring China. This is also a top spot for anyone who likes to go trekking as you can get out into the surrounding mountains and visit the villages of the ethnic hill tribes in Laos. If you don’t want to trek then you can also rent a bicycle or a motorcycle and then spend the day scooting around the various villages and checking out the gorgeous waterfalls in this part of the country. In the town of Luang Namtha itself you can spend your time visiting bustling local markets, sampling the street food and indulging in the herbal saunas here. "
Wat Phu,Wat Phu is also known as Vat Phou and is a gorgeous Khmer temple which is close to the Phu Kao Mountain in the Champasak Province of Laos. This is a Hindu temple which was built between the 11th and 13th centuries and this would have been a strategic location in the mighty Khmer Kingdom that stretched from Angkor in neighboring Cambodia. Nowadays you will find similar temples in style to those at Angkor which are also partially eroded by the jungles of Laos. 
Plain of jars in Phonsavan,"Phonsavan actually means ‘Hills of Paradise’ in the Lao language and this is a great place to come if you want to see a more rural side of the country. This part of Laos is known, rather surprisingly, for its cowboy culture and you will find real life Lao cowboys here who dress in Stetsons and rear cattle on the lush plains around Phonsavan. This is also a good jumping off point to visit spots like the Plain of Jars which is a gorgeous natural structure that is so-named as the pillars resemble jars. "
Muang Ngoi Neua,"Muang Ngoi Neua used to be relatively sleepy and under visited, although nowadays it has become known for being a stop off on the legendary Banana Pancake Trail which wraps around several countries in Southeast Asia. As you would expect, it has now become more and more popular with backpackers who come here for the chance to enjoy the riverside setting and spend time at places like Nam Ou Beach. You can also get out into the small ethnic villages that surround the town or trek to several famous caves and splendid waterfalls. "
Pakbeng,Pakbeng is located between Luang Prabang and Huay Xai and one of the main reasons that people visit is to stay overnight if you take a river trip between the two towns down the Mekong. There is not a huge amount to do in Pakbeng but it is a lovely little spot to spend the night en route to Luang Prabang or Xuay Xai. There are a few nice restaurants in town that look out over the river and this is a great place to come for a cold beer and sunset views over the majestic Mekong. 
Muang Xay,Muang Xay is also known as Oudomxay and Udomxai and is the capital of the larger Oudomxay Province. This town is also close to the scenic Nam Ko River Basin and is known for its gorgeous mountain ranges. This is the largest city in the northern part of Laos and many people come here to access other parts of the country. With that in mind however you can easily spend a few days here as the town is close to a number of famous caves which are a great place to spend some time if you like spelunking. 
Pakse,"Pakse is the capital of Champasak Province and one of the largest cities in the southern part of Laos. Many people come here to then travel onwards to neighboring Si Phan Don, Wat Phou or the Bolaven Plateau and you can also get from Pakse to the Xe Pian National Protected Area or Lao Ngam. With this is mind however, there is still a lot to see and do in Pakse itself if you are travelling through, so try to spend a few nights here if possible. The town lies on the Mekong and Sedone rivers and you will find delicious seafood restaurants dotted along the waterfront as well as herbal saunas for which the area is also famous. "
"Riga, Latvia","Top of the menu for any first-time travelers making their way across the Baltic, Riga is certainly one of the great urban treasures of the region as a whole. It straddles the channels of the Daugava River on the northern edges of the country, boasting a labyrinthine Old Town area which is considered one of the most handsome in Europe. Here, the cobbled streets are overshadowed by the dagger-like spires of the mighty St Peter&#8217;s Church, while the famously reconstructed House of the Blackheads stands definitely elegant after the tumult of Soviet domination over the city. Art Nouveau is the name of the game in the city’s outer districts, with masterworks lining the pavements of Alberta iela. And then – of course – there’s Riga’s legendary nightlife; a medley of hedonistic basement bars and thumping clubs that host locals and stag dos and hen parties aplenty. "
Jurmala,"Stretching for nearly 30 kilometers along the curved coastline of the Riga Gulf, sun-kissed, breezy Jurmala is the place to go during the hotter months of the year. With their unique microclimate and salty air, the various towns that form the so-called ‘Latvian Riviera’ here are known for their mineral mud pools and range of curious holistic health treatments. Beach wise, there are worthy sands running right the way along the breadth of the region, with Majori and Bulduri hailing in as the favourites with their Blue Flag ratings and opportunities for water sporting, collections of shore-side cafes and beach volleyball competitions. No wonder the likes of Brezhnev and Khrushchev came here to unwind! "
Daugavpils Church,"The birthplace of one Mark Rothko is now something of the antithesis to Riga in the north. Nestled between the hills and lakes of the Daugava River valley, the town ticks over to a Russian tune (this is the heartland of Latvia’s Russian-speaking population), and boasts a glorious historical core that is all refined 19th-century architecture courtesy of St Petersburg. The looming bulwarks of the great Daugavpils Fortress mark one of the militaristic hubs of the Russian Empire too, while the golden-hued onion domes and Orthodox cupolas of the Saints Boris and Gleb Cathedral mimic Kiev and St Basil’s atop the skyline of the town. "
Sigulda Castle,"It’s easy to see why the Latvian locals have so many legends about Sigulda. For one, the hills around town come topped with the keeps, bulwarks and crumbling crenulations of one Turaida Castle – Latvia’s answer to Bran of Romania. Then there are the misty woodlands and groves of the Gauja Valley; a veritable gem of the nation’s backcountry that comes crisscrossed by meandering rivers and meandering hiking trails, dotted with caves (check out the massive caverns of the Gutmanis system) and undulating hills. Meanwhile, Sigulda itself blooms with cherry trees and pretty regal architecture from before Latvian independence, and offers a chance for skiing and Nordic walking in the winter. "
"Livonia Order Castle. Bauska, Latvia","First came the Knights of the Livonian Order, who fortified the small islets that sit washed over by the tree-fringed channels at the start of the Lielupe River. Then came the dukes of Courland and the imperial tsars of the Russian state, who raised an altogether new fortification here: the one now commanding the middle of the town with its curious whitewashed walls and red-tiled roofs. But rich and militaristic history aside, Bauska also boasts a charming backwater character, with the river ways flowing through the heart of town lined by ad hoc allotments and farmlands, crossed by tenuous suspension bridges and one pretty market square bustling with local life. Nice. "
Slitere National Park,"Slitere National Park is considered the great natural jewel of the Kurzeme region. Part cultural museum part hinterland, the area encompasses the beautiful Blue Hills and great stretches of undeveloped coastland, rolling sand dunes and sloping yellow sands washed over by the whitecaps of the Baltic Sea. The park juts out into the ocean with the beaches of Cape Kolka, while deep virgin forests cover the interior in groves of fir, elm and rare Baltic ivy. The Slitere National Park also comes dotted with oodles of historic fishing villages, many of which have remained truly off-the-beaten-track and rustic because of the presence of an off-bounds military base in the area during Soviet times. "
"Cesis, Latvia","A picture of traditional Latvian town planning, Cesis has retained all its medieval glory. Its center is lauded as one of the best-preserved historic districts in the country, coming complete with wide cobblestone streets, pretty, painted timber facades done out in the classic Baltic style, stuccoed churches (check out the gorgeous St John&#8217;s Church and its tombs of the Livonian Order knights) and worn courtyards where once Middle Age markets would have thrived. The piece de resistance of the town has to be Cesis Castle; a formidable medley of palisades and gatehouses that’s shrouded by forests close to the center. Here, visitors can discover 800 years of history and tales of Swedish, Russian, Slavic and Polish invaders alike. "
Rundale Palace,"A onetime gift from the Russian empress Catherine the Great, the Rundale Palace is the most elegant remnant of imperial rule from Petersburg left in Latvia. It can be found encircled by blooming rose gardens and English-style lawns close to the town of Bauska. The designs of the façade and grounds are flamboyant and extravagant in the extreme, oozing with all the Italian-esque opulence and eccentricity you’d expect of a piece by the celebrated architect of the Russian court, Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Today, thousands of people flock to tour the interior rooms and gardens at Rundale, weaving between the exhibitions of the Palace Museum and spotting visiting luminaries around the grounds. "
Saulkrasti Beach,"Facing the trodden seaside strips of Jurmala across the waters of the Riga Gulf, Saulkrasti is Latvia’s lesser-known summertime retreat. Quieter and more laid-back than its sun-splashed counterpart on the other side of the bay, it hosts mile upon mile of winding cycle tracks, beautiful ivory sands at the resort town of Pabazi (like Jurmala, Saulkrasti is actually a collection of several towns and villages along the coast) and gorgeous clifftop walking trails through seaside forests. The 18-meter-high White Dune also rises here on the edge of the River Incupe, offering prime sunset viewing and top-notch picnic spots in the shade of swaying linden and fir trees. "
"Araisi, Latvia","Just a short jaunt out of the castle-topped town of Cesis, travelers will find the ancient cultural landscape of Araisi. The most visited and best open air museum in the country, the spot chronicles the lifestyles of the early Middle Age tribes of the Baltic region, who made their home on the lake banks here in timber lean-tos and wooden cottages. There are also the ruins of a castle courtesy of the German Livonian Order on the site, along with oodles of archaeological finds that showcase everything from 14th-century fashion trends to advances in farming and agriculture during the 1300s. In short, this fascinating reconstructed settlement is perfect for anyone eager to unravel Latvia’s deeper past. "
"Ligatne, Latvia","Walkers, mountain bikers, campers, horse riders, wildlife lovers and Nordic skiers alike all flock to the small and forest-shrouded town of Ligatne. As the gateway to the famed Gauja National Park, travelers can expect to uncover striking sandstone gorges and fir-forest-topped escarpments of Devonian rock, the caves of Gutmanala, the beautiful contours of the Erglu Cliffs and countless nature trails that delve deep into the woodlands on the edge of the town. Ligatne itself is a small and sleepy affair, complete with the curiously out-of-place remnants of a paper-making industry boom and lines of pretty cottages topped with corrugated roofs. "
"Ventspils, Latvia","The home of the best-preserved Livonian Order castle in the country – which rises against the cobbles of the Old Town here in pretty, yellow-washed facades – and one of the most bustling ports in the Baltic region, Ventspils offers the perfect balance of history and modernity. Along with its charming Market Square and historic homes on Skolas Street, the city is also known as the flower capital of Latvia. The moniker is honoured from springtime onwards, with blooming beds of flowers and bulbs erupting all around town and along its portside, seaside promenades alike. "
"Ogre, Latvia","Situated just down the courses of the mighty Daugava River as it carves its way into the very heart of Latvia, the town of Ogre has a history dating all the way back to the early years of the 1200s. While overlooked by many travelers making their way through the Baltic region, the spot is perfect for those who want to sample raw, day-to-day Latvian life, seeking out stories of regional oppression in the town museum and wondering at monuments to the victims of the communist regime. Ogre is also worthy of note because of its place on the edge of the pretty Dendrological Park Lazdukalni; a fine reserve for exploring the sheer variety of flora decorating these fringes of Northern Europe. "
Kuldiga,"Old World charm oozes from every crooked cottage and cobblestone lane of Kuldiga; a chocolate box of an historic core that makes its home in the very heart of the Kurzeme. Timber homes dating from the 1700s form some of the most attractive sights in the city, while arched brick bridges and the elegant Baroque finish of the St Catherine’s Church belie the town’s boom time during the years of the Courland duchy. And then there are the roaring waterfalls of the Venta River on the outskirts of town, which gush and flow around the verdant riparian habitats and winding tunnels of the Sand cave of Riezupe alike. "
"Liepaja, Latvia","A patchwork of Art Nouveau and Russian Orthodox, bustling portside industry and blue collar working neighbourhoods, the 90,000-strong city of Liepaja makes for an interesting and immersive visit just a stone’s throw north from the Lithuanian border. The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, with its soaring spire and colossal organ installation, and the bustling daily markets are two of the major draws here, while the former city of Karosta – a onetime clandestine settlement of Soviet military types on the edge of the modern city – is a must. Here, the old remnants of tsarist and USSR forts are now being converted into art galleries and cafes, while windswept stretches of beach hug their way along the coast to boot. "
"Leicester, England","Since his remains were rediscovered under a car park in 2012 Richard III has become the centre of attention in Leicester. There&#8217;s a new visitor centre in the city detailing how his grave was found and the methods used to identify his 500-year-old-skeleton. There&#8217;s a lot more to Leicester though, with high-profile attractions, museums and venues like the National Space Centre, Curve Theatre, the half-timbered 15th century Guildhall, the New Walk Museum and the Cathedral where Richard III was re-buried in 2015. In 2016 the city gave us one of sport&#8217;s most amazing underdog stories when  Leicester City won the Premier League despite starting the season with odds of 5,000-1. The Foxes play at King Power Stadium with a healthy capacity of more than 30,000. "
Melton Mowbray,"Two well-known English delicacies are on the menu in Melton Mowbray. First up is the pork pie, which is uncured seasoned pork chopped and contained in a pastry. This portable food is intended cold and first gained favour with foxhunters here in the 19th century. The market town is also one of the few places permitted to make blue stilton, a powerful, crumbly cheese that goes well will port at Christmas. In these traditional surrounds there are festivals and events every year to honour the town&#8217;s culinary contributions: There&#8217;s the Melton Mowbray Food Festival in October and the Cheese Fair at the end of April, to name but two. "
Loughborough Market,"The largest town outside Leicester is swelled by Loughborough University, which makes up a quarter of the population during term time. So outside summer the town can be fun and youthful and from June to September it&#8217;s a little more sedate, depending on what you prefer. In October there&#8217;s the Loogabarooga Festival, a literary event bringing authors and illustrators to the town, and with lots of fun things for kids to get up to. The centre of Loughborough was updated in the 1930s, granting it some eye-catching art deco architecture, like the cinema on Cattle Market. The weekly markets the town also remind you that you&#8217;re in a healthy rural community, trading on Thursdays and Saturdays, with a vintage market on Fridays. "
Market Harborough,"A building that will catch your eye straight away in Market Harborough is the Old Grammar School. Now more than 400 years old and restored in 2014, the unusual timber-framed building had a grammar school on the first floor, and stood over a butter market, which is now an artisan market on Saturdays. In Harborough Museum the show-stealer is the Hallaton Treasure, the largest hoard of Iron Age coins discovered in Britain, numbering more than 130 and unearthed in 2000. And next to the Old Grammar School is the Grade I-listed St Dionysius&#8217; Church, mostly from the middle ages and with a solemn 47-metre spire to round off the historic scene in the centre of the town. "
Market Bosworth,"You can pick up the trail of Richard&#8217;s last days at this picturesque market town a few minutes north of the battlefield where Richard died, ending the Plantagenet era and heralding the Tudors in 1485. After Richard&#8217;s body were discovered the king&#8217;s funeral cortege came through Market Bosworth in 2015 en route to Leicester Cathedral. The Bosworth Field Heritage Centre is in a country park, and has indoor galleries with weapons and armour, some original and some reproductions for you to try on. There are also regular guided walks to show you the significant locations around the site and add historical colour to what you see. "
Hinckley,"Some way south of Market Bosworth, Hinckley is also convenient to the Battlefield at Bosworth if you want to swot up on a momentous event in English history. But the town&#8217;s manufacturing past is also interesting: The big business in Hinckley was hosiery, going back to the 1600s when the framework knitting machine was introduced. The Hinckley and District Museum is in a set of original framework cottages and will tell you all you need to know about the town&#8217;s knitting history, with historic hand-operated frames to see. As with almost everywhere, church attendance in Hinckley had been dwindling for years. But the medieval  St Mary&#8217;s Church is still involved in the community as a north chapel has been converted into coffee bar and there&#8217;s also an informal bookshop. "
Lutterworth,"In the very south of the county, Lutterworth is a market town that gained its market charter in 1214 and a few grocery stalls observe this tradition on Thursdays. For inquisitive folk there are a few thatched buildings and minor landmarks to see in the centre. Lutterworth Town Hall is a late-Georgian building from 1836, distinguished by its rounded edges and designed by the same man, Joseph Hansom, who gave us Birmingham Town Hall and the hansom horse-drawn cab. There are two fine old pubs: The Cavalier Inn and The Shambles Inn, both with thatched roofs, and the latter dating back to the 1500s. Stanford House, is the plush local manor from 1690, while at the Lutterworth Museum you can view the patent for the world&#8217;s first jet engine. "
Mountsorrel from Castle Hill,"One of the top five most sought-after addresses in Leicestershire, Mountsorrel has loads of period property and is surrounded by lush and undulating countryside, but is also a swift commute to Leicester to the south. The meeting place in Mountsorrel is the Butter Market, which has a classical design from the 1790s. Curiously this replaced a 16th-century market cross, which was taken by the Lord of the Manor to his estate at Swithley, where it still stands. Treat young ones to the Stonehurst Family Farm, a working farm where kids can handle all kinds of domestic animals and where there&#8217;s also a motor museum with a surprising fleet of vintage tractors and sports cars. "
Leicester University Botanical Gardens,"A residential town a few minutes from the centre of Leicester, Oadby has a lot of things to recommend it. In the Brocks Hill Country Park, amid 30 hectares of woodland and meadows, is an Environment Centre with solar panels, wind turbines and rainwater collectors to teach kids about renewable energy. A stunning park of a different variety is the Botanic Garden of Leicester University, maintained by the uni&#8217;s genetics department and surrounded by lovely Edwardian property. Also in Oadby is Leicester Racecourse, which hosts meetings for National Hunt (jumping) and races on the flat, so should have something on whenever you&#8217;re in town. "
Kirby Muxloe Castle,"Also integral to the Richard III trail is this village a couple of miles west of Leicester. Kirby Muxloe Castle is a beautiful and very evocative 15th century ruin encircled by a moat. Anyone who has studied Shakespeare&#8217;s Richard III will know its owner, William Hastings. A follower of Richard&#8217;s House of York, Hastings was accused of betrayal and executed in the space of minutes in London in 1483. Work on his home and fortress stopped immediately, which only makes the ruins of the castle more compelling. You could make a day of it at the high-rated Kirby Muxloe Golf Course, welcoming non-members and in business since 1893. "
Bradgate Park,"Another village that ranks up there with Leicestershire&#8217;s most liveable places is Newtown Linford, which is in the Charnwood Forest. The countryside here is noticeably hillier, and the geology of the place is pretty fascinating: The rocks in Bradgate Park are 600 millions of years old and volcanic in origin. For as long as humans have been here they&#8217;ve quarried the area for stones to sharpen tools and mill grain. And Bradgate House has its own tale to tell, as this ruined estate was home to Lady Jane Grey, Queen for nine days before her execution in 1553. "
Ashby-de-la-Zouch Castle,"In the west of Leicestershire, Ashby is a proud market town inside the National Forest. This park is a major project to replant the enormous woodland that spread over most of the Midlands until the Industrial Revolution, attracting wildlife back to former industrial sites. Hicks Lodge is a good way to see what it&#8217;s all about, at a cycle centre on an old colliery gradually being taken over by trees. Ashby Castle was another property owned by Lord Hastings, who had turned it from a manor house to a fortress in the 15th century. Even though it was half-destroyed in the English Civil War you can still scale the tower for magnificent views and go underground in the secret passage between the tower and kitchen. "
"Tropical Birdland, Desford","A popular family day out in the Leicester area is Tropical Birdland, an aviary where many species of parrot can fly around in semi-freedom before returning to their enclosures at night. A large number of these birds are former pets re-homed to a more humane environment. There&#8217;s a children&#8217;s play area and tea room at the attraction. Before you arrive or after you leave you could park up in Desford for lunch at the Blue Bell in or have a wander around the village. The church is Norman with 13th-century extensions, and the Old Hall on Desford&#8217;s high street goes back to the early-1600s and has Flemish-style gables. "
Wymondham Abbey,"This cute village is just east of Melton Mowbray and is set in Stilton cheese-making country. There&#8217;s a caravan park filled in summer with holidaymakers who want to revel in this swathe of typical English countryside. This lies at the foot of the Wymondham Windmill, which has a 200-year history and has been converted into a tea room and shop. There&#8217;s a friendly pub in the village, the Berkeley Arms and St Peter&#8217;s Church is from the 13th century with an Early English design. For a day out, Belvoir Castle is only  15 minutes to the north and is still the seat of the Dukes of Rutland. Originally this was a Norman fortress but after centuries of damage and rebuilds, a gothic-revival palace was erected here in the 19th century. The grounds have gorgeous vistas of the Belvoir Vale and the interiors are richly decorated. "
"Snibston Mining Museum, Coalville","This town is one of those places where it helps to know what you&#8217;re looking at to be able to appreciate it. As the name suggests, Coalville is an industrial town that didn&#8217;t exist before the 1830s and was home to thousands in a matter of years after coal seams were discovered. The centre has the kind of 19th century cottages constructed for workers that aren&#8217;t as common in Leicestershire as the counties to the west and north. There&#8217;s much to see in the immediate area, like the sensational Donington-le-Heath Manor House, constructed in the 13th century and once owned by the brother of Everard Digby, implicated in the Gunpowder Plot and executed in 1606. "
Tsehlanyane National Park,"The undisputed jewel in the crown of Lesotho&#8217;s national park system comes in the form of the sun-baked highlands of Tsehlanyane. Surrounded by the rock-ribbed peaks of the mighty Maloti Mountains (also home to the Afriski resort, believe it or not!), the region is famed for its rare woodland habitats and high altitudes of up to 5,600 meters above sea level. Trekkers often opt to hit the connecting trail that links the park with Bokong, and come to delve into the wildernesses of chi chi trees and rare fern species, endemic berg bamboo groves and mountain animals that abounds in all its glory here. "
Maseru,"Welcoming, stable, small and on-the-up, Maseru might just be something of the odd one out when it comes to African capitals. Slowly being reconstructed after a period of upheaval in the late 90s, the town is now a charming and characterful place to while away a few days. The most noticeable landmark has to be the appropriately-named Basotho Hat, which is actually a gift shop selling traditional Basotho arts and crafts. Aside from that there&#8217;s a smattering of great tailors and international eateries, not to mention a fair bit of backpacker traffic in the bars. "
Semonkong,"Nestled between the dusty escarpments of the Maseru District, close to the geographical heart of Lesotho as a whole, the little conglomeration of bamboo-topped thatch villages and huts that is Semonkong might not look like one of the most-visited spots in the country; but it is. Why? Well, that honour surely has to go to the mist-producing plumes of the great Maletsunyane Falls, which can be found roaring over the edge of a table-top mountain nearby. Thousands of visitors come to wonder at this great natural creation, to scale the mountain paths in its presence and see the ice-caked plunge pools into which is descends. "
Katse Dam,"Blocking the meanders of the Malibamat&#8217;so River as it flows down from the cold highlands of the country, the Katse Dam once reigned supreme as the largest of its kind in all of Africa. And while that superlative has been taken by the Tekezé Dam of Ethiopia, there&#8217;s no question that this dramatic wall of concrete and steel remains one of the continent&#8217;s real engineering wonders. Surrounded by grass-topped mountains and undulating peaks, it clocks up a whopping 185 meters in height and comes in at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level! "
Bokong,"Nestled between the dramatic mountains just to the west of the aforementioned Katse Dam, the little hill town of Bokong is a great place to wax up the walking boots and hit the trails of central Lesotho. In the immediate vicinity, visitors will be able to discover the likes of the Lepaqoa Waterfall, crashing over the escarpments of rock that define Lesotho&#8217;s highlands in plumes of mist and steam. The surrounding Bokong Nature Reserve is also a real draw. Complete with winding hiking trails and maintained campsites, it&#8217;s a great place for horse riding and trekking, and even runs into the paths of the Tsehlanyane National Park on its northern fringes. "
Liphofung,"The sinewy mountains around Liphofung rise in hues of ochre and snow-white during the winter. They conceal the fascinating historic sites of the Moteng Valley, which have yielded evidence of human habitation in these parts of Lesotho since at least the Stone Age. Today, visitors can come and explore the unique history of the Liphofung Caves, where a well-rounded visitor&#8217;s center now offers an insight into the old Basotho kings and the ins and outs of traditional Basotho craft culture. There are also oodles of walking routes in the area, and some good campsites to boot. "
Leribe,"Also known by the name of the river that fringes the north and south of the town (Hlotse), little, laid-back Leribe is the place to go for a glimpse of authentic Basotho life. Set right on the Lesotho-South Africa border in the north of the country, its wide, sun-baked streets are lined with low-rise shacks and tin homes. Some draws include the local marketplace, the Leribe Craft Center (loaded with handmade fabrics and wools), and one or two historic wartime lookout points (dating from the years of English colonialism). There are also English-style statues peppering the squares and a pretty Anglican church to see. "
Butha-Buthe,"The gateway to the northern passes, the northern &#8220;city&#8221; of Butha-Buthe touts easy access to the prehistoric wonders of the Moteng Valley, some of the country&#8217;s most dramatic mountain roads, and the aforementioned Afriski ski resort to boot. However, the town itself is also worth a little attention, thanks largely to the natural rock fortresses on its edges. These once helped the Basotho kings fend of Zulu invaders, and still offer some breathtaking views over the roofs of the city and surrounding district. "
Thaba Bosiu,"You could be forgiven for thinking that you&#8217;d been transported to the hoodoo-spiked lands of Arizona or Mexico when you first behold this vast and flat stretch of desert-like sandstone that dominates the landscape between the Orange and Caledon Rivers. But no, this is still Lesotho, and the two square kilometers of elevated space offered by the Thaba Bosiu plateau represents the historic natural fortress of the Basotho tribe, while the spot also served as a stronghold during the Basuto Wars, and against the Boers during the Basotho conflicts with the Orange Free State in the 1850s. "
Ha Kome,"The awesome Ha Kome cave houses of Lesotho&#8217;s Berea District are surely one of the most striking wonders in the country. Carved directly from the rock faces of the surrounding mountains, they can be found hiding between the valleys close to the village of Mateka. A truly earthy and interesting look at traditional family living in this part of Africa, the structures are still inhabited by the descendants of those who built them almost 200 years ago. Come and meet the cave dwellers and take a tour of the on-site Ha Kome Visitors Centre, which unravels the heritage of these curious highland settlements. "
Mohale,"Mohale is a beautiful place. Sprawled over the sculpted mountains right in the heart of the country, it&#8217;s enveloped by sweeping highland panoramas on all sides. And while there are only a few who come to enjoy the less-popular trekking away from Bokong and Tsehlanyane, most these days will flock into the region for a glimpse of the award-winning Mohale Dam. Intended as a backup to the aforementioned Katse Dam, this awesome structure counts a whopping 145 meters in height and bridges a wide crest on the Senqunyane River of more than 700 meters in total! "
Mafeteng,"Once a hot point of conflict during the Gun Wars of the late 19th century, and then subsequently a working mill town, little Mafeteng makes its home south of the Basotho capital and close to the border with South Africa to the west. A place at once industrial and historic, it&#8217;s known for its flair for local famo music, and has a clutch of good hotels, local eateries and bars besides. Mafeteng is also a convenient stopover if you&#8217;re making a beeline for the border at Wepener, or going deeper into the mountains, to spots like Malealea, or to the cultural attractions of Morija just to the north. "
Teyateyaneng,"The gateway to the great mountains of the Berea District, where ancient San tribal cave paintings hide between the rocks and monolith villages – still inhabited, mind you – emerge from the dusty cliffs, Teyateyaneng (often conveniently referred to as just T.Y) is one of Lesotho&#8217;s more enthralling and interesting highway towns. It&#8217;s known for its earthy local craft markets, which boom with wood carvings and traditional costumes throughout the week. There are also weaving galleries and the occasional mountain tavern to enjoy. And the city is a great option for further explorations into Ha Kome and Hlotse. "
Morija Museum and Archives,"Famed for its other moniker – the Selibeng sa Thut – Morija is something like Lesotho&#8217;s answer to England&#8217;s Cambridge or the US&#8217;s Massachusetts. Long a center for learning, it&#8217;s considered the go to place to unravelling the mysteries and histories of the Basotho culture and past. The main institution has to be the acclaimed Morija Museum and Archives, which contains fascinating relics that detail episodes of the Gun Wars, the Boer War and English colonialism in these parts. The town is also the host of an annual arts and culture event, which brings traditional dance, live music and performances to the streets. "
Sehlabathebe National Park,"The paradise on the tops of the Maloti Mountains, Sehlabathebe National Park occupies around 68 square kilometers on the very roof of Lesotho. It&#8217;s actually joined at the hip with the Maloti-Drakensberg Park National Park across the border in South Africa, and boasts the same breathtaking vistas of rolling highland savannah, wild flower meadows and verdant valleys overlooked by craggy faces of primeval stone. Intrepid travelers flock here to ride across the plateaus on horseback, encounter semi-nomadic tribal peoples, and embark on some of the most beautiful trekking trails in the entire Qacha&#8217;s Nek region. "
Monrovia,"Hectic, frenetic, smooth and sophisticated (at least in its own, very West African way), Monrovia is home to more than one million Liberians. The largest city in the country, it is a place of great energy. Rumbling bush taxis float over the pot-holed roads around the center, while the bustling boulevard of Broad Street, nestled between the meanders of the Mesurado River and the Atlantic Ocean, is a picture of life. Here, you can expect throbbing beer bars and the fading remains of old 19th-century townhouses; you can tour the fascinating National Museum and trace the history of Liberia&#8217;s coups and counter coups, civil wars and political trails at the eerily abandoned Ducor Hotel. "
Sapo National Park,"Unquestionably the most famous of Liberia&#8217;s duo of national parks comes in the form of the Sapo National Park. This 1,804 square kilometer territory of the Upper Guinean Rainforest is said to have one of the highest mammal biodiversity counts of anywhere in the world. And boy does it show! Intrepid folk who opt to delve into the old growth woods will get to spy out pygmy hippopotami and white-crested Diana monkeys, crocodiles, leopards, speckle-throated otters and chimpanzees. There&#8217;s also an interesting history to unravel, with dark episodes having unfolded here during Liberia&#8217;s civil wars and even a fully-fledged gold rush having taken place in the early noughties. "
Robertsport,"The king of all Liberia&#8217;s surfing spots (and there are quite a few), Robertsport has positioned itself firmly on the forefront of the country&#8217;s new tourism drive. Long-haired wave riders with board wax in hand now flock to join the surfing troupes and hit the rolling Atlantic swells that buffet the likes of Fisherman&#8217;s Point, Cotton Trees and Cassava. Surf schools are also popping up to get beginner travelers out and onto the waves, while  others will just come to hike the coastal stretches to see the pretty reaches of Cape Mount Bay, and see the trademark timber and stone churches that pepper the shore. "
Buchanan,"Located around just three hours by rumbling bush taxi south out of the capital at Monrovia, the seaside city of Buchanan is a fine introduction to the coastal character of this part of West Africa. The beaches are all undeveloped to the T, with swaying palm trees and groups of local children playing in the shallows. Many opt to camp here, while others will hit the city itself, seeking out one of the few guesthouses that lurk between the frenetic markets and streets. There is also a stretch of beach bars to enjoy, found nestled between the crumbling bamboo shacks along the shore. "
Gbarnga,"Gbarnga might seem just another of the sprawling ramshackle towns that sprout from the sweeping mud plains and forests of inland Liberia, but this regional capital of Bong County has just a little more history and heritage up its sleeve than most. For one, it was the place where the infamous political and rebel leader Charles Taylor coordinated actions of various civil wars across the area during the 1980s and 90s. The town is also the home of the more than 100-year-old Cuttington University; one of the most prestigious in the country. Add in a couple of dramatic waterfalls and earthy guesthouses, and Gbarnga becomes and exciting place to visit away from the more popular coastal destinations. "
rubber plantation,"Visitors will find the industrial outpost of Harbel straddling the meanders of the Farmington River, just a stone&#8217;s throw back from the Atlantic coast, where Marshall and the monkey-dotted beaches of the resort towns south out of Monrovia make their home. Famed primarily as the home of the largest rubber plantation in the world, Harbel is engulfed by swathes of rubber tree forests, many of which bear the familiar corporate name of Bridgestone tyres. The town is also known as the site of the Roberts International Airport – the main access point to the north-west of the nation. "
Gola National Forest,"The Gola National Forest is the new name for the Lofa-Mano National Park: a great dash of primeval rainforest that sprawls out along the northern border of the country with Sierra Leone. One of the densest remaining tracts of Upper Guinean woodland in the region, the area has everything you&#8217;d expect of a real West African wilderness. Yep, you can expect verdant canopies and seemingly endless stretches of colossal tree trunks and boughs, hidden fern fields where exotic dragonflies flit between the flowers, swinging chimpanzees, rare pygmy hippopotamus – the list goes on! "
Bushrod Island,"The island of Bushrod gets its name from one of the few American politicians that actually advocated the resettlement of slaves on the continent back in the 1800s. But that’s about as deep as the erstwhile politician, Bushrod Washington&#8217;s, influence runs in this mangrove-fringed port town on the edge of the Atlantic. Today, streets of tooting vehicles run in and out of the jetties and docks, the ramshackle slums of New Kru Town sprawl close to the shoreline, and there&#8217;s an indelible energy of life throughout. It&#8217;s not the most comfortable place to visit, granted, but it is an interesting glimpse at working, modern Liberia nonetheless. "
Marshall,"Tourists will really only make a beeline for the ocean-side reaches of laid-back Marshall for two reasons. The first is its smattering of empty beaches, each backed by verdant pockets of palm forest and mangrove swamps, and perfect for enjoying some truly intrepid camping on the Liberian coast. The second is the small archipelago appropriately named Monkey Island. Here, a troupe of feisty chimps inhabit the jungles. They were rescued from research labs during the civil war, and now are particularly fond of swinging in the boughs, teasing tourists and catapulting fresh fruit from their branches at passing boats – you&#8217;ve been warned! "
Zwedru,"With just 23,000 people making Zwedru their home, and a whopping seven-hour drive separating the spot from the country&#8217;s capital on the coast, this far-flung county seat might not seem like the best place to add to that Liberia itinerary. However, Zwedru has a number of interesting features that you simply won&#8217;t find in the more trodden reaches of the west. For starters, it still retains something of an earthy, industrial vibe, thanks to its fledging logging enterprises. And then there&#8217;s that unrivalled access to the dense Upper Guinean jungles, complete with multi-coloured tropical hummingbirds and uber-rare plant species aplenty. "
Kakata,"The end-point on the relatively well-functioning Monrovia-Kakata Highway that departs the capital and delves in the western wilds of Liberia, this small regional hub of Margibi County is where the bucolic heartlands of West Africa finally take over the landscapes. They do so in the form of seemingly endless rubber plantations, and Kakata has made its name (and modest fortune) as one of the rubber trading and transporting outposts of the nation. Come to see the dust-caked community churches and delve into the lively local marketplaces that erupt ad hoc on the streets throughout the week. "
Greenville,"One of the favoured gateways to the aforementioned Sapo National Park (which can be found lurking between the dense forests just a little to the east of town), Greenville is no stranger to tourists. However, while most who arrive simply stock up and head out to see the chimps and exotic rainforests of the reserve, those who linger will get to see an intriguing remnant of Liberia&#8217;s resettlement era – the town does still bear the moniker of its namesake in Mississippi after all! There are also some interesting villages to explore up the courses of the Sinoe River, along with some truly unspoilt beaches along the coast to the west. "
Harper,"Situated in the extreme south of Liberia, where the turns of the African panhandle give way to the beaches of the Ivory Coast, the city of Harper has its fair share of both natural and human attractions. For starters, the shores to the north-west and south of town are fringed with gorgeous Robinson Crusoe sands, with swaying coconut palms bristling against the Atlantic breezes at their back. And then there are the remnants of Liberia&#8217;s old slave settlers, who are thought to have first begun crafting the modern state on the lands of Cape Palmas where Harper now stands. You&#8217;ll see this legacy in the age-stained colonial frontispieces and arcaded plantation-style homes. "
Voinjama,"Set deep amidst the sun-scorched jungles of Liberia&#8217;s extreme north-eastern edge, the small regional hub of Voinjama offers a picture of rustic West African life. The roads are caked in mud and the houses topped with thatch or sheets of hardwearing zinc to keep out the sporadic torrents of rain. The humidity can get unbearable, but if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous (and we mean really adventurous), a trek out to the surrounding timber villages might just be worth it. You&#8217;ll cross swinging monkey bridges and meet communities all but cut-off from modern life. "
Sanniquellie,"Sanniquellie is a small town that sits close to the international tristate border with Ivory Coast and Guinea in the extreme west of the country. A bustling little market dominates the center of the place, with rows of colourful fruits and vegetables plucked straight from the fields making up the bulk of the produce sold. After haggling your way through this, you can settle in one of the earthy local beer bars, or opt to wax up the walking boots and make a beeline for the East Nimba Nature Reserve. This breathtaking end of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Strict Nimba boasts rare highland savannahs, lowland rainforests and rare animals like the West African lion to boot! "
Tripoli,"Before the tumult of the civil war and the rising of the Arab spring, Tripoli was a poster boy for North African heritage. Its winding labyrinth of backstreets melded the warmth and colours of the Med with the dusty and historic character of the Sahel. Street vendors touted spice-covered, ghee-doused bazins from the roadside stalls; teahouses throbbed with the mellifluous tones of Arabic chatter and the twisting fumes of shisha pipes. And at the center of town visitors would find the grand Assaraya al-Hamra, spilling itself into the tight-knit lanes of the medina in a medley of mosque minarets and formidable Ottoman towers. "
Leptis Magna,"Founded by the Phoenician Greeks sometime in the first millennium BC, and then raised to greatness by the Romans, who flocked to this coastal spot in western Syria to secure their strongholds in North Africa after the Carthage Wars, Leptis Magna is quite possibly the single most impressive ancient site in the country (sorry Cyrene!). While some sections of the old temples and peristyles here have been transferred to museums and parks in England, the majestic likes of the grand theatre, arches dedicated to Septimius Severus, the fortification walls, some early Roman basilicas, and the crumbling marketplace all still remain. "
Benghazi,"Much-ravaged Benghazi has had its fair share of troubles in Libya&#8217;s wars. And while the city continues to rattle in the throes of factional trouble, it is trying to shake of the memory of those hard-fought battles during the campaigns of 2011 and 2012, and re-establish itself again as one of the principle port towns in North Africa. Glimmers of the glorious past still remain too, like the elegant whitewashed homes of the Italian Quarter, the sun-kissed corniche called Lungomare on the Med (palm-peppered and pretty), the old Latin lighthouse on the shore, and the picturesque Maydan al-Shajara square in the very center of city. "
Cyrene,"A legendary patchwork of temples and ancient townhouses that sits perched atop the Mediterranean cliffs in eastern Libya, Cyrene is one of the greatest relics the Greeks left in North Africa. Once a booming mercantile colony built by the seafarers of Santorini, the city played host to Hellenic merchants, the heirs of Alexander the Great, and, later, Roman generals and armies. Today it lies half in ruins; abandoned since it was rocked by a great earthquake in the 4th century AD. Visitors come to tour the colossal shrines to Demeter, see the necropolis, and explore the revered Sanctuary of Apollo. "
Ghadames,"Whitewashed homes scramble over one another in the heart of desert-shrouded Ghadames. Meanwhile, winding alleyways hemmed in with adobe walls weave back and forth through the medina that forms the middle of the city &#8211; a UNESCO World Heritage Site in its own right. Nestled between the sand dunes of the northern Sahara just a stone&#8217;s throw from the Algerian border, this earthy little Berber outpost is hailed as one of the real jewels of the nation&#8217;s backcountry. Travelers come to explore its palm-peppered roads and shady terraces, and get a glimpse of the Libya that time forgot. "
Ghat,"This far-flung town on the edge of the historic Fezzan region was once one of the principal trading points on the Sahara-Sahel caravan route. Topped by its great mud-brick castle, Ghat still looks the part too, especially with all those crumbling old neighborhoods of adobe Berber homes spreading out from the base of the central mount. However, the fortress seen today was not actually even there when the kings of the Garamantian Empire ruled the trade links between Carthage and the south in antiquity. It was built later by the Italians and today, along with the rugged caves and cliffs of the Tadrart Acacus mountains, forms the major point of interest in the town. "
Sabratha,"Like Cyrene before it, Sabratha followed the predictable trajectory of a onetime Greek colony on the North African coast. First, it was a receptacle for Mediterranean goods coming southwards, and a marketplace for exotic African goods coming from sub-Sahara. Later, the whole city was taken over by the Romans, who raised great temples to both local and imperial gods. There are remnants of a Christian basilica built by Justinian too, along with the grand mosaics that once adorned the interior. However, the piece de resistance is the ancient theatre, which erupts from the desert in a series of lurching Doric peristyles and arcades. "
Sirte,"The birthplace of one Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has not fared well in Libya&#8217;s recent upheavals. Targeted by the rebel forces and used by the loyalists for their last stand, hardly a single street went unscathed in the ensuing Battle of Sirte in 2011. It was here that the onetime leader of the nation was finally captured and killed, marking the end of his more than 40-year-long rule. Today, other conflicts engulf the town, but efforts are being made to rebuilt and reconstruct the spot, which was once a colonial outpost of both the Ottomans and the Italians. "
Tobruk,"Like many cities in Libya, Tobruk has seen its fair share of carnage in the last 100 years. However, Tobruk is best known as a battlefield of a different era: The Second World War. During the early 1940s, this town was the site of some of the fiercest skirmishes between Allied and Axis troops in the region. The ordeals were finally settled by the Second Battle of El Alamein. In the modern era Tobruk remained steadfastly loyal to the Libyan monarchy, and was quick to rise with the tide of the Arab Spring. Visitors will get to tour the site of these totemic events, and unravel tales of Greek, Roman and Berber history besides. "
Misrata,"Lining up along the shimmering Mediterranean coast, the 500,000-strong city of Misrata (also spelled Misratah) represents the third-largest in the country. Founded by the Greeks (like so many towns in these parts), it grew into one of the principal trading ports in North Africa, with a booming harbour at Qasr Ahmad that dealt in both African and European goods. Most visitors will come to enjoy the sun-kissed beaches that meld with the Saharan dunes to the east and west of town, while others will tour the great city mosques and the multi-cultural array of architecture that imbues the center. "
Waw an Namus,"Taking us away from Libya&#8217;s war-torn cityscapes and ancient sites for a spell of the weird and the wonderful, the black-stained tar and rock fields of Waw an Namus are a truly otherworldly sight to behold. Set deep in the very heart of the Saharan Desert, the attraction is only just becoming popular with intrepid travelers. They come to wonder at the great extinct volcanic cone that rises from the sands, its nearby crater lake (shining like a mirror and forever buzzing with a haze of mosquitoes), and the old caravan oases towns of Al Kufrah and Rebiana. "
Msallata,"Engulfed by swathes of olive plantations and undulating hills of scrub that roll out to meet the Med and the Sahara to the north and south respectively, it&#8217;s one of the prettier spots in the Murqub District. Visitors to the town, which was the site of some violent clashes during the 2011 revolution, can come and wander rustic olive oil mills and farms. There&#8217;s also a long history to uncover, as Msallata once hailed in as one of the major stop-overs on the way to ancient Leptis Magna during the heyday of Roman rule in these parts. "
Al Jawf,"Al Jawf is surrounded by the sweeping ochre sands at the very heart of the Libyan Sahara. A small town, it&#8217;s largely made up of low-rise adobe homes and camel-dotted streets that come pot-holed and crooked. And while there&#8217;s little to experience in the city itself apart from the earthy Bedouin character of the place, there&#8217;s plenty in the surrounding hinterland. Yep, Al Jawf is the gateway to the Kufra basin; one of the most strategic agricultural areas in the region, famed for its irrigation capabilities and alien-looking crop circles. This surrounding territory has been much fought over since time immemorial, just as relics like the crumbling 7th-century granaries at Gasr Al-Hajj reveal. "
Waddan,"Below the rugged tips of the El-Bhallil mountains and peppered with surprisingly green spots of palm oases, the desert town of Waddan is a great place to come and catch a glimpse of the earthy backcountry character of Libya, and to unravel the deep Islamic histories that have coalesced here over the centuries. Look up to see the crenulated walls of the great Waddan Castle, which were raised by the onetime Arab rulers of the Maghreb. Then, be sure to take some time to wander the date palm groves and marketplaces, taking in the bucolic, time-stood-still vibes. "
"Schloss Vaduz, Liechtenstein","This tight-knit capital of a tight-knit country is home to a humble 5,100 people, and sprawls out along the meanders of the Rhine River right on the edge of the state’s border with Switzerland. In the 17th century, it was here that the ambitious Hans-Adam I secured the dynastic seat of the family of Liechtenstein, by acquiring dominion over the Vaduz valley and entering the upper echelons of power in the Holy Roman Empire. Today, the town is shrouded by both the serrated peaks of the Swiss Glarus Alps and the fairy-tale spires of the great Vaduz Castle alike. The latter is still the home of the country’s princes, and offers a nostalgic throwback to the 16th-century past of the nation with its turrets and precipitous bulwarks, while the city itself conceals other attractions, like one acclaimed KunstMuseum, oodles of wine cellars and Liechtensteinish taverns to boot. "
"Nendeln, Liechtenstein","Tiny little laid-back Nendeln cascades down the ridges of the fir-clad Ratikon ranges just a stone’s throw from the border with Austria and the pretty Vorarlberg town of Feldkirch. Ringed by swathes of woodland and shrouded by the snow-mantled peaks of northern Liechtenstein above, this town boasts one postcard-perfect setting, not to mention a certain off-the-beaten-track vibe that’s thanks to its place close to the more popular village retreat of Eschen. Between the clean and comely streets, travelers will discover a smattering of small Austrian-style taverns, some Roman ruins, the niche Schadler Ceramics Workshop – which produces excellent handmade china pieces – and one or two wine cellars touting Chardonnay and Gewurztraminer alike. "
"Steg, Liechtenstein","Set high on the plateaus of the Alps around Triesenberg, betwixt cloud-topped summits and thick forests of silver fir and Norway spruce, the peppering of timber chalets that forms the heart of Steg is the very epitome of Liechtenstein’s mountain beauty. Remoter than many of the more popular winter sports resorts in the country, the verdant valleys that encompass this tiny little hamlet bloom in the winter with hardy edelweiss and Alpine meadow flowers, and come dashed through with one shimmering, mirror-like high-altitude lake complete with crystal-clear waters and that trademark turquoise hue. The village is also watched over by the 2,000-meter high Kirchlespitz, and is enticingly close to the famed ski fields of Malbun deeper in the Ratikon. "
Triesenberg,"Set to the curious tones of Walser German (an interesting local vernacular language that developed after mass migrations over the Bernese Oberland in the Middle Ages), Triesenberg village can be found cascading its way down the slopes of the Alpine hills above Vaduz. It’s the centre of a pretty and picturesque region that dominates the very heartlands of the country with its patchwork of verdant meadows and high-perched pastures of grass. Around its edges, visitors can spy out a smattering of pretty timber barns and farmhouses, while the middle of the town is home to the St Joseph at Parish Church, complete with Austrian-style domes, onion-shaped cupolas and an enchanting mountainside cemetery. "
"Mauren, Liechtenstein","4,000-strong Mauren can be found nestled neatly right on the borderland join between Liechtenstein and Austrian Vorarlberg to the east. Largely overlooked amongst tourists as they pass through from the neighbouring (and virtually conjoined) town of Feldkirch, the settlement actually boasts a history going back all the way to the Bronze Age, while it was the 7th century that gave Mauren its first church spire; one that was to undergo continuous reconstruction over the following centuries. Today, this parish is imbued with gorgeous Gothic glassworks and traces of the Romanesque style from the 16th century, while beautiful Mauren itself spreads out under the snow-mantled massif of the so-called Three Sisters peaks in the distance. "
"Eschen, Liechtenstein","Also nestled under the trio of summits called the Three Sisters is the lowland, valley-bottom town of Eschen. Clustering around the main roadway that runs north to south through Liechtenstein, this charming little spot and its spiked church spire make a great stop off for drivers rolling their way through the country. The whitewashed parish – the Holy Cross Chapel &#8211; that looms over the open square in the centre of the village is perhaps the piece de resistance, while rows of elegant half-timbered homes with echoes of Saxony and Germany pop up ad hoc on the corners. The best of these is the so-called Pfrundhaus, which hosts everything from Unterlander wine tasting to medieval music shows between its 14th-century walls. "
Malbun,"The winter sports mecca of the Ratikon makes its home deep and high amidst the Liechtenstein Alps. As the only real ski resort in the country, Malbun draws more than its fair share of visitors, boasting an altitude of more than 1,600 meters above sea level (nicely placed atop the treeline) and a great smattering of challenging red and easy-going blue runs. Add to that a collection of truly modern and cutting-edge chairlifts (think bum warmers!) and the family-friendly Malbi Park Kinderland for the younger, beginner skiers, and it’s easy to see why this one is being hailed as Liechtenstein’s most accomplished family-friendly resort. Of course, the views over the Vaduzer Tali valley and the high Central Eastern Alps are also to die for! "
"Burg Gutenberg &#8211; Balzers, Liechtenstein","Sat in the shadow of the chiselled Regitzer Spitz of Switzerland, on the lowlands of southern Liechtenstein, Balzers clings to a pretty spot on the edge of the winding River Rhine. The town is perhaps most famed as the home of the Old World Gutenberg Castle, which represents one of the only two surviving medieval fortifications in the country. Dating from the 12th century, this hilltop keep rises like a limpet on its small knoll against the Glarus Alps, showcasing the development of medieval fortification in the region and offering enthralling tours of its interior rooms, its bailey and manicured rose gardens. Meanwhile, Balzers itself spreads out below, throwing up wine bars and interesting chapels alike. "
"Schaan, Liechtenstein","Liechtenstein’s economic and industrial powerhouse has none of the gritty energy of the major German boomtowns of the Rhineland further north. Instead, this one’s 5,800 people make it at once the country’s biggest municipality and the most down-to-earth and modern. Of course, the streets still come shrouded by the serrated tips of the Rakiton Alps, and the centre is imbued with the likes of the Church of St Laurentius, complete with a sharp Gothic spire and a charming stone façade. It’s on the peripheries where travelers will find the depots and warehouses of the country’s manufacturing enterprises, while the Austrian-owned Schaan-Vaduz train station remains one of the most popular and busiest arrival points in the state. "
Schellenberg,"One of the northernmost draws of Liechtenstein makes its home close to the lowland streets of Schellenberg, also found clustering around the banks of the Rhine. Just outside of the town proper, right on the cusp of the Austrian border in the district of Hinterschloss, the crumbling bulwarks and keeps, palisades and towers of what was once possibly the country’s most impressive castle still stand tall. The finest ruins are at the Upper Castle, which dates back to the 14th century and displays a fascinating array of interior rooms and stony fortifications. Meanwhile, the Lower Castle dates back even further and offers a fine insight into the history of lowland Liechtenstein. Both sites are eminently walkable. "
"Planken, Liechtenstein","Cut off in the remoter climes of the Ratikon, small and sleepy Planken is the quintessential high Alpine settlement. Home to just 366 people, it’s visited mainly by hikers and mountain bikers who stop-by while crisscrossing the mountains, casing out the massif of the Three Sisters, or flitting between the popular trekker huts at Sucka and Furstensteig. Others will come to glimpse the town’s simple and stripped-down timber church spire, thought to have had its origins in the middle of the 19th century (though reconstructed since then), while the clusters of welcoming, hearty Liechtensteiner inns make for some interesting mountain accommodation options to boot! "
Schalun Ruins,"Schalun Castle is unquestionably one of the most enchanting ruined castles in Liechtenstein. It sits nestled between the Alpine peaks just a short hike out of the capital at Vaduz, set under the shadow of swaying Spanish firs and spotted with lichen that’s been growing since the fortification was deserted and burnt down sometime before the 18th century. The ruins themselves date from the 1100s, making them some of the oldest of their kind in the region, while the crumbling remnants of the court rooms and great hall that are still visible at the site exude a palpable fairy-tale, fantasy, Game of Thrones-esque aura that’s difficult not to love! "
"Gaflei, Liechtenstein","Bathed in fresh Alpine breezes right throughout the year and the home of the first ever health and recuperation resort in Liechtenstein, tiny little Gaflei remains a popular stop-off for hikers and trekkers making their way through the plateaus of the Triesenberg district. The spot is set high above the Rhine Valley, and makes for sweeping panoramas of the Swiss Glarus Alps across the border to the west. The popular walking routes that scale the valleys of the Gafleispitze and Alpspitze start from the town, while other trails delve deep into the Furstensteig area. Close by is where travelers will also discover the exact geographical middle point of the country: at Bargalla. "
"Silum, Liechtenstein","This small, high-perched village on the Triesenberg plateau is known amongst hikers and trekkers for its homey, timber-clad walking hut, while others champion its glorious views of the Swiss Alps to the east and the snow-capped ranges of the Ratikon to the west. Surrounded by pockets of perennially-green fir forests and the craggy bowl-tops of the central Liechtenstein peaks, the cluster of just a handful of timber barns and guesthouses that forms the heart of the place is truly beautiful to behold by both summer and winter. What’s more, Silum makes a great pit stop if you’re heading eastwards by foot or ski touring, delving deeper into the valleys around Steg and the ski fields of Malbun. "
Ruggell,"Ruggell is about as far away from the mountains that it’s possible to get in Liechtenstein, which means this town is just a short, hour-long hike from the beginnings of the Ratikon ranges for most! The Rhine chops right through the heart of the centre here, babbling past the charming façade of the St Fridolin&#8217;s Parish Church and offering stretches of jogging and cycling paths as it goes. Add to that the celebrated Ruggell Film Festival, which draws short film makers from right across the continent each year, and a central arts and culture centre, and a stop off at Ruggell makes for a heritage-packed visit for sure! "
"Lincoln, England","An astounding cathedral city, Lincoln nestles in a gap in the Lincoln Edge, a long escarpment in western Lincolnshire. The old city adapts to this steep topography, and most of the historical monuments are in the higher part, known as Uphill. There&#8217;s masses of beautiful architecture on these winding streets, where Lincoln&#8217;s clergy and military elite once lived. Lincoln Cathedral is an English gothic treasure, completed in the early-14th century and with supreme panoramas from its roof. Lincoln Castle is one of England&#8217;s best-preserved Norman fortresses, and is rare in that it has two earthwork mottes. There&#8217;s a gallery at the castle presenting one of only four surviving copies of the fabled Magna Carta, dating to 1215. "
"Stamford, England","Almost implausibly beautiful, the centre of Stamford is composed entirely of buildings from the 1600s and 1700s. And most of these are made with local limestone, which gives the town a solemn quality that has attracted Hollywood productions in the last decade. You&#8217;ll want to explore every last nook, but one of most photo-worthy scenes is the view of St Mary&#8217;s Bridge crossing the Welland. St Martin&#8217;s Church is sensational, and you also need to see the almshouse Browne&#8217;s Hospital, which was founded in 1485. But whatever you do, you&#8217;d be remiss to leave Stamford without seeing the glorious Burghley House. This 16th-century palace was the seat of Lord Burghley, a high-flying member of Elizabeth I&#8217;s court. "
"Boston, England","In the low-lying Fens region to the south of the county, where farmland was reclaimed from marshes in the 17th century, Boston&#8217;s most emblematic monument made is all the more impressive for the flatness of the surroundings. St Botolph&#8217;s Church, popularly known as &#8220;The Stump&#8221; for its tall and truncated tower, is from the late-14th century and could claim to be one of England&#8217;s most beautiful and unique churches. Boston was a crucial trading post in the middle ages, when it was an unofficial member of the Hanseatic League. The gothic 14th-century Guildhall is a testament to this importance and now houses a museum that will clue you in on Boston&#8217;s medieval wealth. "
"Harlaxton Manor, Grantham","This town gave England two of its most renowned figures. First there&#8217;s Margaret Thatcher, and you can read up on her early years in the town at Grantham Museum. Less likely to divide opinion is Sir Isaac Newton, born at Woolsthorpe Manor, moments south of Grantham, in 1642. He returned to Woolsthorpe in his 20s to perform experiments and is said to have observed that apple falling from the tree at this farmstead. If you have a taste for country houses in landscaped grounds, Belton House and Harlaxton Manor are two majestic estates around Grantham and are suitably glorious. While just south is Ellys Manor House, a grand early-16th-century mansion built for wool merchant in the Flemish style with a crow-stepped gable. "
Horncastle,"The well-to-do town of Horncastle was granted its market charter in the 1200s and trading continues on Thursdays and Saturdays. Two regional delicacies to keep in mind are plumbread, a sort of fruit loaf, and poacher cheese, which is matured for a year or more. And to be a real &#8220;yellowbelly&#8221; you&#8217;re supposed to eat them together! Pottering around Horncastle&#8217;s smart streets is fun as there&#8217;s a profusion of antiques shops in town, more than in any other place in the county. Horncastle is also the last major settlement southwest of the Lincolnshire Wolds, so could be a tasteful place to stay while you take in the beautiful scenery in this hilly region. "
Skegness,"An good old-fashioned day at the seaside awaits you in Skegness, which had its heyday in the early-20th century after taking off towards the end of the 1800s. This is when it got its pier, which through bad weather and accidents has suffered damage down the years but is in good condition today at almost 120 metres in length. The beaches are long, wide and sandy, and a trait of the climate in eastern England is that there&#8217;s a smaller chance of rain than at northwester resorts like Blackpool. Family attractions abound, like the Natureland Sea Sanctuary, a marine zoo with a conservational job, rescuing orphaned baby seal pups and releasing them back to the wild once they&#8217;re grown. "
Grimsby Fishing Heritage Centre,"It wouldn&#8217;t be accurate to describe Grimsby as &#8220;pretty&#8221;, but you can definitely say it&#8217;s an interesting place, with a history that needs to be told. In the mid-1900s Grimsby had the largest fishing fleet of any port in the world. But although fishing is still a big employer, the town is now post-industrial. So any trip to Grimsby should involve the Grimsby Fishing Heritage Centre, an immersive museum that puts you on board the Ross Tiger, a trawler from the 1950s, to see for yourself the rough conditions that trawlermen had to cope with. "
Gainsborough Old Hall,"On the River Trent, which empties in the Humber more than 50 miles to the north, Gainsborough remains the most inland port in England. In industrial times its access to the North Sea made it a base for manufacturing, and during a stroll around the centre you won&#8217;t help but notice Marshall&#8217;s Yard, where the long-defunct Marshall, Sons &amp; Co would produce agricultural machinery, and which is now a shopping precinct. For history of a more courtly kind, Gainsborough Old Hall is among the most complete medieval manors in England, completed in 1460. Kings would stop and dine here on their way up to York, and amid its warren of passageways is possibly England&#8217;s best-preserved medieval kitchen and a marvellous Great Hall that evokes renaissance feasts. "
Louth,"With the Wolds to the west  and the coast not far to the east, the first landmark you&#8217;ll spot as you approach Louth is the spire of St James&#8217; Church. And this monument is the ideal starting point for a wander around the handsome town. You&#8217;re looking at the tallest medieval steeple of any parish church in the country, towering to almost 90 metres and completed in 1515. Unlike many towns in England, Louth has kept its traditional shopping amenities like butchers, bakeries and greengrocers. Louth is also billed as the &#8220;Capital of the Wolds&#8221;, and you hardly have to leave the town to get a taste of the characteristic rolling scenery: Hubbard&#8217;s Hills is an idyllic chalk valley donated to the people of Louth in the early-20th century. "
"Sleaford, England","Rated as one of Lincolnshire&#8217;s most liveable towns, Sleaford is a historic town around yet another of the county&#8217;s sublime churches. The outdoor market in front of the church still trades on Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays, and of you happen to be around for the first Saturday of the month there&#8217;s a special farmers&#8217; market bring the best of the local produce from the fertile Fenlands. And as for that church, St Denys&#8217; was finished around the 1300s with a decorated gothic design and is feted for the dainty traceries on its windows. The Slea River has been crucial to Sleaford&#8217;s growth: In the 1700s it was made navigable to barges, and the wharfs you can still see in the town are a symptom of that development. "
Market Rasen Race Course,"Grazing the western reaches of the Wolds Area of Natural Beauty, Market Rasen is a quintessential English market town. The centre has few modern buildings; instead there are dignified red brick townhouses from the 18th and 19th century. If horseracing is your thing there are meetings year-round at Market Rasen Racecourse, at Market Rasen Golf Club has been open for more than a century and has very affordable green fees. The bucolic splendour of the Wolds is on the doorstep, as is the village of Tealby, often voted as the most beautiful in Lincolnshire. Have a pint or pub lunch at the King&#8217;s Head here, which is the oldest thatched pub in the county, established in 1367. "
Cleethorpes,"One of England&#8217;s beloved &#8220;bucket and spade&#8221; seaside destinations, Cleethorpes comes into its own on warm summer days. At the start of the 19th century this was just a fishing village with a population of 200 or so, but the railways brought visitors from Yorkshire&#8217;s industrial towns keen for some fresh air, and by 1873 the elegant wrought iron pier had opened. This structure still has a swish restaurant at its end and was named &#8220;Pier of the Year&#8221; in 2016. Cleethorpes&#8217; allure hasn&#8217;t changed since the 1870s either; there are more than four miles of sandy beaches and lots to keep kids happy, from crazy golf to the Cleethorpes Light Railway. "
Spalding,"Right in the south of Lincolnshire, in the district of South Holland Spalding is England&#8217;s centre for flower cultivation and  every spring the Spalding Flower Festival is dedicated to the local bulb industry. The most spectacular property in Spalding has to be Ayscoughfee Hall, a 15th century house that looks just as it did when it was built and is conserved as a museum in delightful formal gardens. In summer the most relaxing way to get there is on the Spalding Water Taxi: This shuttles along the River Welland and theCoronation Channel between the town centre and the Springfields Shopping Outlet. "
Caistor Church,"In the northernmost hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds, Caistor is a quaint market town that prides itself on the welcome it gives to walkers. In the warmer months a lot of people pass through on the Viking Way, a 147-mile footpath that weaves through the county from the Humber Bridge down to Rutland beyond Lincolnshire&#8217;s southern boundary. And you couldn&#8217;t pick a more charming place to stay, as Caistor&#8217;s centre has lots of beautiful Georgian and Victorian homes all belonging to a conservation area around the lovely market square. "
"Alford, England","Small but sweet, the town of Alford is a stone&#8217;s throw from the Wolds but also minutes from resorts like Mablethorpe on the coast. Alford is a rural town that has also cultivated an artistic side, as you&#8217;ll find out on Bank Holiday weekends in May and August when craft markets set up here. Alford Manor House is a melange of styles, but has interior fittings going back to the 1611. Inside you get a real cross-section of life in this part of Lincolnshire, in galleries full of farming tools and memorabilia for the village. Alford also has a working five-sailed windmill, which continues to grind organic grain for its tea room. "
"Vilnus, Lithuania","The historic capital of the Grand Duchy is a veritable treasure trove of medieval wonders and gorgeous Gothic come Russo-flavoured Baroque architecture. In the Old Town, cobbled roadways weave under the buttresses of the beautiful St Anne’s Church, over café-spattered plazas and under the soaring Gediminas Keep and Upper Castle citadel dating from the 13th century. Meanwhile, the new town’s blocks pulse with beer bars and sleepless rock clubs, and Europe’s boho district extraordinaire – the self-proclaimed Republic of Uzupis – beckons on the edge of town, a place of shabby-chic, graffiti-strewn streets and more drinking joints than you can shake a cepelinai potato dumpling at! "
Kaunas,"Jutting out over the confluences of the Nemunas and Neris rivers right in the heartlands of central Lithuania, the second-city of Kaunas proudly stakes its claim as the country’s alternative hub and partying capital. Thousands of students drive the nightlife, which bubbles up on the tree-shaded boulevard of Laisves Aleja and between the countless craft bars and underground drinkeries of the historic centre, while daytime means seeking out the crumbling bulwarks of the red-brick Kaunas Castle and wandering the enchanting cobblestone alleys of the Old Town – Kaunas’ prettiest district and the home of charming medieval merchant guilds and one gorgeous city hall. Then there’s the exhibitions dedicated to M. K. Ciurlionis (arguably Lithuania’s best-known artist), which simply shouldn’t be missed! "
"Kernave, Lithuania","UNESCO-attested Kernave is steeped in a history and heritage that goes back further than many of the other towns in Lithuania. It’s hailed as one of the first ever medieval capitals of the Grand Duchy, and it’s thought that the golden age boom happened here in the 13th and 14th centuries, before the onslaught of the Teutonic Order came and razed the fortifications and keeps. Today, travelers who make their way to the archaeological reserves lining the meanders of the Neris River can spy out mounds (literally!) of relics, now clad in earth but concealing layer upon layer of bulwarks and burial sites, throne rooms and more, and tracing back to the late Palaeolithic Period no less! "
"Klaipeda, Lithuania","Erstwhile Memel was once one of the strongholds of Teutonic rule in the Baltic, later becoming a thriving port and trading town of the Duchy of Prussia, and then the northernmost city in the German Empire of the late 19th century. Today, Klaipeda bursts with relics of this 800-year-long history, all the while combining them with the more modern edge and nightlife scene expected of the touristic gateway to the Curonian Spit (Lithuania’s most famous coastal stretch). That means travelers can weave between curious sculptures and cobbled squares in the Old Town, hit Lithuanian taverns to sip the locally-brewed beer and case out the bulwarks of Klaipeda Castle all in the same day, and that’s not even mentioning the medieval docksides, the cannong-dotted Prussian bastions and the German-styled beer halls of the main square! "
Dunes in Neringa,"A patchwork of verdant pine forests and flat grasslands, undulating dunes and sandy beaches that curves its way along the Baltic Coast where Lithuania arches towards its long-time Polish compadre in European history and the curious Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Neringa is one of the most coveted destinations in the country for sure. Encompassing the whole Lithuanian length of the Curonian Spit, the area offers prime biking and hiking, windsurfing and fishing on the waters of the Curonian Lagoon, the sun-kissed resort strips of Nida and the earthy cottages that makeup age-old towns like Pervalka. Then there’s Thomas Mann’s charming cottage to see, and the various artist workshops and galleries that sprouted here with the German exodus out of Konigsberg in the 1800s. "
"Palanga, Seafront","Palanga has become a byword for summertime hedonism amongst Lithuanians right across the country, and today this one’s high-season electro and chart parties rage from June to August on the Jonas Basanavicius boulevard and amidst the countless bars and al fresco cocktail joints that line its fringes. The beach is another magnet during the dog days, offering perhaps Lithuania’s most accessible and sunbather-friendly stretch of golden Baltic sand. But it’s not all late nights and lazy afternoons in Palanga either. There’s the picturesque neo-Renaissances charm of the Tiskeviciai Palace to see too, along with the interesting Amber Museum, and the nature reserves of the Curonian Spit nearby! "
Dzukija National Park,"Lithuania’s largest national park covers a whopping 550 square kilometers of land, and makes its home on the edge of the Belarusian border in the extreme south-east of the country. It’s adorned with great swathes of pine forests and riparian wetlands, all of which come cut through by the meandering channels of the Nemunas River. Inland dunes are an interesting feature too, rising and dropping to sandy peaks and troughs and playing host to a kaleidoscope of different grasses and rock strata. Boardwalk treks delve deep into the woods for those donning the hiking boots, while mushrooms bloom in the undergrowth and traditional waxwork crafting abounds in the rural villages. "
Trakai Castle,"Trakai is a fantastical fragmentation of islets and grassy hills, shimmering waters and rolling meadows. It makes its home just a little to the west of the capital at Vilnius and draws crowds of travelers and locals right throughout the year. Many come to wonder at the Lord of the Rings-style castle that forms the heart of the Trakai Historical National Park; a sprouting of red-brick keeps and turrets that mirrors perfectly against the lake waters all around. Others come for the summertime recreation that clusters around the banks of the trio of large lakes: Akmena, Galve, Skaistis. Then there’s the curious multicultural remainders of the Karaim community – a unique Turkic tribe that still uses the pretty timber Trakai Kenesa synagogue that’s seen on-site. "
Anyksciai,"Sat midway between Kaunas and the Latvian border in the east, the indelibly green town of Anyksciai offers a natural getaway balanced with some truly handsome religious architecture. Check out the soaring Gothic spires of the red-brick Basilica of Apostle Evangelist St Matthew that dominate the banks of the meandering Sventoji here. With a history going back more than 500 years, this striking construction now touts the tallest church towers in all of Lithuania and some bright stained-glass works by the revered artist Anorte Mackelaite. After that, be sure to dust off the walking boots (if summer) or wax down the skis (if winter), because Anyksciai has also got the humble ski resort of Kalitos Kalnas and endless arrays of hiking trails on its peripheries. "
Church in Druskininkai,"Moneyed, manicured Druskininkai is the prime spa town in all of Lithuania. It was famed as far back as the 1600s, under the Grand Duke Stanislaw August Poniatowski, and then rose to prominence in the 19th century with the patronage of one tsar Nicholas I of Russia no less. The city continues to go from strength to strength, and today its gilded mansions and spa facilities ooze with the chatter of well-to-do Muscovites and city livers. But mineral-packed waters and healing powers aside, the spot also hails in as the onetime home of Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis (and there’s a fine museum chronicling the artist’s life), and the spot of the all-new Forest Museum &#8211; an immersive exhibition that takes visitors on a haunting journey through Lithuanian folklore and witchery. "
Panevezys,"Lithuania’s fifth-largest cityscape can be found sprawled out on the rolling floodplains of the Nevezis River, in the very heartlands of the country’s northern reaches. Once a royal charter town in the boom days of the Grand Duchy, the city was rumbled and rocked and razed with the Industrial Revolution and tumultuous European conflicts of the 20th century. That said, some remnants of the pre-war elegance do remain, whether in the ochre-hued facades and Russian Imperialist styles of the city cathedral, or the lines of aged cottages that occasionally pop up amidst the utilitarian blocks courtesy of Stalin et al. "
Hill of Crosses in Siauliai,"Most people who flock to the post-industrial, onetime Soviet powerhouse city of Siauliai come in search of the legendary Hill of Crosses, which rises in a haunting array of crucifixes and effigies of Christ to the north of the town proper. However, linger just a little in this off-the-beaten-track center and you’ll discover an array of pretty tree-lined streets, a buzzing café culture, and a gorgeous local cathedral with eye-catching whitewashed faces and a spiked tower. Be sure to stroll the cobbles of Povilas Visinskis Square, too and flit in and out of the curious and quirky exhibitions on offer at the town’s Bicycle Museum and Radio and TV tech institutes. "
Aukstaitija National Park,"The first ever national park in Lithuania continues to turn heads with its beautiful backcountry patchwork of old growth pine forests and nigh on 30 individual lakes and river ways. Yes sir, Aukstaitija is a veritable outdoorsy gem of the country’s north-east, offering adventurous types a glimpse of the famed riparian wilds that roll all over this section of the Baltic. Deer stalk the woodland paths here, while rushes sway on the banks of colossal Lake Tauragnas. Meanwhile, ancient artifacts and rustic villages draw the attention of anthropologists (it’s thought this area has been inhabited for more than 11,000 years!), and there are haunting burial sites and timber churches to rival even the Viking mounds and staves of Scandinavia. "
Plateliai Lake,"Standing right in the midst of another of Lithuania’s great natural jewels, Plateliai is the much-loved gateway to the Zemaitija National Park, which crowns the grassy Zemaiciu Highland region just a short way from the salt-washed coast of the Baltic Sea. The verdant and lush surroundings here make for great walking, and even host attractions like the Plokstine missile base left over by the Soviets &#8211; now home to the fascinating Cold War Museum. In the town of Plateliai itself, visitors can spy out one gorgeous timber church from the 1700s, or opt to leave the city streets for a jaunt along the banks of the eponymous lake, where grassy meadows and laid-back hotels but right up to the water’s edge. "
Rumsiskes,"Creaking windmills and faded wooden cottages clad in moss and sod mark out Rumsiskes from the ever encroaching districts of Kaunas that neighbour it. Unfortunately, the creation of a reservoir in the middle of the 20th century submerged great portions of the old town here, while efforts to preserve the centuries of history associated with the site gave rise to the largest open-air ethnography museum in the entire Baltic region: The Open-Air Museum of Lithuania. Travelers who make their way here today can expect re-enactment tours and traditional architecture aplenty, along with collections of historic furnishings, clothing, religious iconography and more. "
"Avery Island, Louisiana","Avery Island is one of Louisiana&#8217;s most famous sights, known around the world for being the birthplace of Tabasco sauce. Although the island is home to a small human population, it is actually a salt dome, which was initially covered by fauna before being discovered. Avery Island&#8217;s top attractions include the visitor center and the pepper sauce factory, but there is much more to the island than its association with Tabasco sauce. "
Christmas In New Orleans,"New Orleans is one of the most unique places in the whole world, let alone in Louisiana, with Christmas a particularly special time to spend in the city. New Orleans might not get the snow some parts of the United States receives at this time of year, but that does not affect the joyful atmosphere that spreads throughout New Orleans at Christmas time. The Krewe of Jingle holiday parade kicks off Christmas in New Orleans, while the St. Louis Cathedral and Jackson Square hold a series of events throughout December. Among the biggest Christmas traditions in New Orleans is enjoying Reveillon, a French-inspired meal meaning &#8216;awakening&#8217;. Modern New Orleans food mixes with Creole cuisine for this unforgettable culinary experience. "
"St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans","St. Louis Cathedral is one of the most famous sights in New Orleans, and indeed in the whole of Louisiana. Located in the city&#8217;s thriving French Quarter in front of Jackson Square, the history of the cathedral dates back almost 300 years, although the building has been regularly renovated, rebuilt and upgraded. The cathedral &#8211; the mother church of the Archdiocese of New Orleans &#8211; is the United States&#8217; oldest continuously active Roman Catholic Cathedral. The rear of the cathedral also houses St. Anthony Garden, which has a statue of Jesus that is spectacularly lit up at night. "
"Venice, Louisiana","Venice &#8211; sometimes known as The End of the World &#8211; is one of Louisiana&#8217;s many must-see sights. Often used as a starting point for offshore fishermen, Venice was particularly badly affected by Hurricane Katrina. In the years since the horrific natural disaster, a great deal of work has been done to rebuild the community, which is now beginning to thrive again. Nearby to Venice is also the must-visit site the Breton National Wildlife Refuge of the Chandeleur Islands, which was established by the order of the then-President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. "
"Avery Island, Louisiana","While Avery Island is understandably known as the home of Tabasco sauce, the island is also famous for its bird sanctuary, which is called Bird City. The wildlife refuge has been built up slowly over many decades and is now the migration site for an estimated 100,000 egrets. Nesting season begins around February and the birds remain on the island until the winter months arrive. President Roosevelt once described Bird City as &#8220;the most noteworthy reserve in the country.&#8221; "
Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge,"The biggest urban wildlife refuge in the United States, Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge is located within the city limits of New Orleans and is a must-visit location for anyone who is interested in conservation. A massive wading bird rookery is one of the main attractions of the refuge, which also has alligators, bald eagles and brown pelicans that call the site home. Many people driving along I-10 in New Orleans East do not even realise they are in Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, which covers a vast total area of 24,000 acres. "
Horace Wilkinson Bridge,"Of the many bridges that cross the epic Mississippi River, the Horace Wilkinson Bridge at Baton Rouge is perhaps the most impressive of the lot. The cantilever bridge, which is the highest to cross the Mississippi River, carries Interstate 10 from Baton Rouge to Port Allen. Six lanes of traffic cross the bridge, which is named after three separate men named Horace Wilkinson who served in the Louisiana legislature for a combined total of 54 years. Keen photographers will be keen to snap the Horace Wilkinson Bridge, which is a special backdrop for pictures. "
"Mississippi River, Louisiana","There is no doubt that the Mississippi River is one of the greatest rivers in the whole world. Dozens of bridges cross the river from its starting point at Itasca State Park in Minnesota to the mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. The Port of South Louisiana is based around the river, with some 500 million tons of shipped goods passing through the port every year. A journey along the Great River Road through Louisiana makes for a wonderful experience, with cities such as St. Francisville, Baton Rouge and Plaquemine among the places the river flows through, as well as Tallulah, Morganza and, of course, the city of New Orleans. "
Atchafalaya Basin,"Louisiana is known for its wetlands and the Atchafalaya Basin is the largest swamp in the whole of the United States. The Atchafalaya is a particularly unique ecosystem as a result of its unusual combination of stable wetlands and a growing delta system. Among the many attractions of the Atchafalaya Basin is the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge, which houses alligators, waterfowl and a huge array of migratory birds. The basin stretches an amazing 140 miles southward and it is a massive source of crawfish, with 22 million pounds of the fish coming from the basin each year. "
Melrose Plantation,"Melrose is one of the most unique plantations in the South. Sometimes also called Yucca Plantation, Melrose was one of the biggest plantations that were built by and for free blacks. There are eight structures in total at the plantation, with the Association for Preservation of Historic Natchitoches providing guided tours of Melrose. The plantation features on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. Melrose was established by Louis Metoyer, a slave who became a free person of color when he was finally granted his freedom. Metoyer went on to build a uniquely African structure that is a must-visit experience for anyone spending time in Louisiana. "
"French Quarter, New Orleans","New Orleans is one of the world&#8217;s great cities, with the French Quarter by some distance the oldest neighborhood in the city. A National Historic Landmark, the French Quarter was damaged by Hurricane Katrina but after huge work to restore it, is now back to its bustling best. Among the many attractions people should see when visiting the French Quarter is Jackson Square and St. Louis Cathedral, the busy bars of Bourbon Street and the Audubon Cottages. The French Quarter is known around the world for its party atmosphere and it is one of the only places in the United States where consuming alcohol from open containers is permitted on the street. Bourbon Street also hosts the famous annual Mardi Gras celebration, which draws thousands of people to celebrate on the streets of New Orleans. "
Louisiana Swamp Tour,"Taking a swamp tour is one of the best ways to experience life in Louisiana. There are few places in the world as untouched as the swamps of Louisiana and a guided tour all-but guarantees seeing a huge variety of wildlife, all in their unspoiled natural habitat. Lafayette is one of the top starting points for a Louisiana swamp tour, but there are countless fantastic options all over the state. Alligators, herons and egrets are among the wildlife present in the state&#8217;s swamps. "
Jungle Gardens,"Many people heading to Avery Island miss the chance to explore the Jungle Gardens in favour of learning about its Tabasco-related history, but this is a huge mistake as the Jungle Gardens are one of Louisiana&#8217;s surprise gems. Azaleas, camellias and bamboo is all present in the gardens, while alligators, deer and raccoons are among the many animals living in the vicinity too. A centuries-old Buddha statue is one of the most unmissable sights on Avery Island, and indeed in the whole of Louisiana. "
New Orleans Garden District,"We&#8217;ve already covered the French Quarter, St. Louis Cathedral and Christmas in New Orleans, but the city has so much more to offer. The Garden District is a beautiful spot to while away a few hours. Superb 19th century mansions are to be found here, with the St. Charles line streetcar making access around the area simple. Landmarks to look out for in the New Orleans Garden District include the George Washington Cable House, while one of NOLA&#8217;s most famous restaurants, Commander&#8217;s Palace, is also based in this part of the city. "
Oak Alley Plantation,"Along with Melrose Plantation, Oak Alley Plantation is another of the most important historical sites in the state. Located in Vacherie, St. James Parish, Oak Alley Plantation is particularly notable for the row of trees that gave the plantation its name. The architecture and landscaping on show at the plantation have led to it being made a National Historic Landmark. Oak Alley Plantation is one of the South&#8217;s most spectacular settings. The trees at Oak Alley Plantation are over 300 years old and to this day it is a mystery who originally planted them at the site. "
Jean Lafitte National Historic Park And Preserve,"Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve consists of six separate sites around the New Orleans area. Among these is the Chalmette Battlefield and National Cemetery, where the Battle of New Orleans took place in 1815, as well as the French Quarter Visitor Center in the city of New Orleans itself. Much of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is located just a short trip out of the city but it feels a world away, offering the chance to enjoy nature at close quarters. "
Audubon Park,"Located in the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans, Audubon Park is one of the most beautiful places in the whole of Louisiana. The park is named after artist and naturalist John James Audubon and is built on land that was initially a plantation. Today, the park has sports fields and picnic facilities, as well as a golf course and a rookery attracting hundreds of wading birds. Part of Audubon Park is known locally as the Fly due to its butterfly-shaped river viewing shelter. "
Echternach,"This cosy little town near the German border is the oldest in all of Luxembourg. It’s the perfect base camp for exploring the region because of the laid-back “lazy afternoon ramble” atmosphere of the place. Plan to say here if you’re interested in hiking in Mullertal or Cycling along the River Sure. For the last 500 years, pilgrims come every Whit Tuesday for the dancing procession in honour of the town’s founder, St. Willibrord. If you’re coming in May and June, enjoy the International Music Festival, and take a look at the Prehistory Museum, The Basilica, and recently discovered Roman villa at any time of year. "
Vianden Castle,"Also on the German border is Vianden, a quaint and hilly town on the River Our.  The two most striking features of the town are its old-world charm and Vianden Castle which stands high above the river. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries, the castle was a prominent home for Luxembourg royalty for hundreds of years before falling into ruin for almost as long. Restoration has been ongoing since the 1970’s and it’s once again returning to its former glory and now offers some of the most photogenic vistas in the entire country. Above the castle is a fantastic restaurant, accessible only by chair lift, which has the best views of Vianden and the surrounding mountains. Be sure to visit the Victor Hugo museum located in the house he once lived it. "
Diekirch,"Diekirch takes its name from the nation’s most popular beer and is well-loved by tourists for the colourful local flavour that’s found here. Located in the north and sitting on the Rive Sure, the mountains that surround Diekirch make incredible vistas at each turn. Check out the pedestrian zone for shopping, cafes, and public concerts and head to the old quarter to see St. Laurentius Church and other old-world homes. Three great museums to check out are the National Museum of Historical Vehicles, the beer museum, and the National Museum of Military History with an exhibit that thoroughly covers the Battle of the Bulge. It’s also a good place for those that want a little nature in their holiday.  You can bicycle, hike, kayak, or fish while you’re here. "
Château de Beaufort,"A small town that’s high in charm, Beaufort is most often visited because of its castle which lies across the valley from the town proper. Originally built as a Roman camp, the castle expanded over the years but has never recovered from the WWII Battle of the Ardennes. Tourists can explore the many levels and interiors of the castle, though there is no décor. Afterwards enjoy an afternoon of cycling or hiking with several lovely trails to choose from. "
Luxembourg City,"The country’s capital is also a UNESO World Heritage site and major financial centre for much of Europe. You’ll want to spend as much time as possible in the old town and see the Grand Ducal Palace, the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Place d’Armes, Adolphe Bridge, and the underground defences popularly known as the casemates. But it’s not just historical beauty here; Luxembourg City is a thoroughly modern and cosmopolitan place that’s done an incredible job of merging history with modern progress. As an example, check out the fortress of Luxembourg that has been transformed many times over the centuries and now highlights the best of European culture. "
Moselle Valley,"Covering 42km that stretch from Wasserbillig to Schengen, the Moselle Valley and the river that runs through it are lined with small villages, vineyards, and wine cooperatives. Schengen, famous due to the EU agreement that allows easy cross-border travel, has been attracting wine lovers for generations. Each village in the valley has a distinct charm and is home to fine dining restaurants and a relaxing vibe that will make you wish you lived there. Villages of note include Remerschen, Remich, Greiveldange, Ehen, and Machtum. Known as d’Musel by the locals the valley has unbelievable fruit plantations to explore, themed hikes (like the wine route), water sports and small cruises, and a bit of medieval history as well. "
Mullerthal,"This region of Luxembourg is known as Little Switzerland because of the hilly green landscape. What you’ll notice first is the unique rock formations. They’re hard to describe but unforgettable once you’ve seen them.  Echternach is the main city within the region but there are all kinds of reasons to branch out. World renown for a fantastic cuisine based on honey, liqueurs, and cheese, the restaurants in Mullerthal serve incredibly refined dishes – particularly in the valley of the Lower Sure. For experienced hikers, the Mullerthal Trail covers 112km of fields, forests, and rock formations.  For those less experienced but no less enthusiastic, there are plenty of easier hikes that will take you to some awe-inspiring vistas. "
Ardennes,"For a truly exceptional nature experience, head straight to the Ardennes.  With both winding valleys and scenic highlands, tons of hiking and cycling trails, you’ll be able to explore the many forests and villages throughout the nature parks. Not surprisingly, some of the best maintained medieval ruins in all of Luxemburg can be found here. You’ll find everything from medieval revivals, traditional markets, and outdoor performances and concerts to transport you back to another time. Within the Ardennes, you’ll find two nature parks, Naturpark Öewersauer and Our – both distinct destinations in their own right. If you’re feeling adventurous, try some Nordic walking along the Sûre or the Alzette. "
Clervaux Castle,"Created in 2005 within the Ardennes region, Nature Park Our is worthy of its own mention as a top tourist choice. Shaped by the snaking Our River, the park covers 309 square kilometres and alternates between deep valleys and high plateaus. The mission of the nature park creators is to focus on socio-cultural and economic developments while maintaining natural resources and respecting cultural heritage. You won’t want to miss the photo exhibits in Clervaux Castle, the mining museum in Stolzembourg, or the Festival “Jardins à suivre.” Tourists are able to buy the regions agricultural produce direct from the farmers, which help both the local economy and the environment. "
Larochette,"Right in the centre of Luxembourg, Larochette is ideally located to be your home base for your entire trip through the Grand Duchy. It sits picturesquely between two rivers and the villages slate-roofed homes stand out dramatically beneath the cliff top ruins of a medieval castle called Maison de Crehange. If you do make it your home base, be sure to check out the surprising cafes and fine-dining restaurants. You’ll love coming back to Larochette after a day of exploring the different regions and attractions nearby. "
Bourglinster,"As you’re headed to Larochette, Bourglinster and the 18th century castle there, is a great place to stop for a meal or an espresso.  The castle sits inside the remains of an older 12th century fortress.  You’ll find exhibitions there and occasionally performances.  In each of the side wings are two fine dining restaurants, La Distillerie and Brasserie Côté Cour, both with incredible ambiance and décor that matches the castles as well as fantastic food. "
Terres Rouges,"This region gets its name from the red ore that drove the success of the Luxembourg industrial era. Known to locals as Terres Rouges, the area now combines new technology with ancient techniques to serve the current industrial needs of the country. Three trendy and fun cities make up the core of Terres Rouges:  Differdange, Esch-sur-Alzette, and Dudelange. You’ll find plenty of culture in each city that ranges from rock festivals, street theatre, and other concerts. You can visit Rockhal to learn how Luxembourgers gave a new face to this area and so changed the country. If you’re travelling with family, be sure to visit Parc Merveilleux in Bettembourg. Your kids will enjoy the monkeys, crocodiles, parrots, and more that the park showcases. "
Rumelange,"Also located in the Land of the Red Rocks, but worthy of its own mention, is the old mining town of Rumelange.  The main attraction here is the National Mine Museum – which is considered by many to be one of the top tourist attractions on earth. The museum allows guided walks through the old mine tunnels and you can enter by riding in an old mining train.  The town itself is located in the forest of the Kayl Valley with a ton of great trails to enjoy by foot or bike. "
Naturpark Upper Sûre,"Known as Luxembourg’s “water area” because of the 380 ha lake, Naturpark Upper Sûre is the model of sustainable tourism.  The park was awarded the EDEN prize in 2010 for commitment to integrating tourism, culture, social and economic development with environmental protection. If you’re looking to relax, this largely untouched land is the perfect place. You can join in a themed itinerary or go at your own pace as you like.  Most of the leisure activities are designed to highlight the region’s history, culture, and natural aspects. "
Hollenfels,"If you’re driving during your Luxembourg holiday and considering what routes to take, you must absolutely include the Eisch Valley of Western Luxembourg.  With the town of Arlon at one end and Ettelbrück at the other, you’ll have the most peaceful drive of your life as you wind your way through lush forest. You’ll pass by a number of castles – some which are majestic ruins and others that are more mansion-esque châteaux.  You’ll want to stop in Ansemborg to view the castle there from the striking formal gardens. And if you like a good moat, then you’ll love the medieval castle at Hollenfels. "
Skopje,"Skopje is most definitely Europe’s most eclectic capital city.  Efforts have been made, rather successfully, to bring infuse new culture in the form of museums, fountains, bridges, and statuary throughout the city.  The result is something grand that has come to symbolize a new national identity for all Macedonians. The history still remains in places like Kameni Most (Stone Bridge), Sveti Spas Church, Tvrdina Kale Fortress, and the old Turkish bazaar Caršija. Be sure to check out the giant statue of Alexander the Great, commissioned to celebrate Macedonia’s 20th year of independence. The shopping and nightlife in Skopje are also something to experience – if this is what you’re looking for, head straight to Makedonija Street. "
Bitola,"Bitola is an old Ottoman town once known as the “City of Consuls” because it served as a diplomatic centre for the region. Elegant and sophisticated are the best worlds to describe it. You’ll see colourful townhouses from the 18th century and Turkish mosques throughout.  The not-to-be missed and certainly often repeated experience is to sit along the Širok Sokak (Wide Street), sipping espresso, and watching everyone come and go. Bitola is the second largest city and is a favourite among Macedonians for its café culture and European atmosphere. Discover the Deboj Amam Turkish Bath (17th century), the Old Bazaar, Jeni Mosque, and Isak Beg Mosque (both 16th century). "
"Monastery of St Archangel Michail in Varos, Prilep","Prilep is famous for a few unique things.  First, agriculturally speaking, it’s Macedonia’s tobacco capital.  Second, became known as “the city under Marko’s towers,” from when it was the medieval capital for Kings Marko and Volkasin – who populated the town with churches and monasteries. Located in Western Macedonia Prilep has a distinctive landscape of huge rocks sparsely scattered at the base of a small hill.  At the top of the hill are the ruins of a medieval fortress.  The locals have a distinct flavour as well – which you can see in their humour and their dedication to preserving their traditions. "
Kruševo,"Though it only has 10,000 citizens, Kruševo was once its own republic. Macedonians equate the town with the centuries-long struggle to win independence from the Ottoman Empire. During the last revolution, as it looked like Macedonia might be successful, Kruševo experienced ten days of freedom before a massive Ottoman army burned the town and martyred national heroes like Pitu Guli and Nikola Karev, who led the revolution. You can visit Mechkin Kaman and Makedonim, two monuments built to commemorate the uprising. As you explore the town you’ll learn the many reasons why August 2 is an important date throughout the country and such an intense point of pride. Nestled in the Baba Mountains, Kruševo features incredible architecture and several monasteries and churches worth visiting. "
"Flooded church, Mavrovo National Park","The perfect place for skiing, National Park Mavrovo is Macedonia’s biggest winter resort, covering over 730 sq km of forests, gorges, waterfalls, and karst fields.  You can also see the country’s highest peak, Mt Korab, which stands at 2764m.  No matter what time of year you visit, the high-altitude fresh air and the staggering vistas are more than worth the trip. Nature lovers can wander among the diverse fauna and flora and take a hike around Mavrovo Lake. Galichnik and Janche are two quaint villages nearby, as is St. Jovan Bigorski Monastery. "
Pelister National Park,"The oldest of the three great national parks is Pelister, located in western Macedonia near Bitola.  With nearby Mount Pelister (2600m), and eight other peaks that top 2000m, the vistas are a magnificent natural escape from daily life. The park is home to the five-needle pine molica – found on only a few mountains in the Balkan Peninsula – something all nature enthusiasts will love to see. There’s also roe deer, wolves, bears, chamois, eagles, partridges, and red billed jackdaws. Pelister also has two wonderful mountain lakes, which the locals call Pelisterski Oci or Pelister’s Eyes, that offer great hiking opportunities like the Stone River – crushed rocks that form a path heading up the mountain slopes. "
Stobi Ruins,"One of the most important archaeological sites in the country is found in Stobi.  First founded in the 7th century by the King of Paeonia, the city changed hands several times, from the Macedonians, to the Romans and Byzantines. Strategically located along an old Roman trading route, Stobi quickly became a hub for traders travelling from the Danube in Serbia to the Aegean Sea in Greece.  The dig site is open every day and the town itself is just an hour drive from Skopje. "
Gevgelija,"Most likely the top tourist spot in all of Macedonia, sunny Gevgelija has a reputation for fun and big times.  It’s called the “Macedonian Las Vegas” because of the casinos, five star hotels, nightclubs, galleries, and concert venues.  There are lots of opportunities for exclusive entertainment here but the fun is meant for all. If you need to step away from the black jack table or the buffet, Gevgelija offers Smrdliva Voda, a spa with sulphur baths and over 400 villas to choose from. Nature is also on full display here with a sublime climate and a pine and deciduous forest, there is a rich biodiversity here that makes the region special for all of India. "
Povardarie,"There are well over 24,000 hectares of vineyards in Macedonia, as well as an incredible 2000 year history of viticulture. Deep in the fertile Vardar River Valley lies Povardarie, whose wines are well known throughout the world. The most popular varieties are Vranec and Smederevka – so be sure to sample them when you visit. In Povardarie there are three wineries that you must discover for yourself: Winery Tikves, Stobi Winery, and Popova Kula. Popova Kula Winery is regularly ranked at the finest winery in the country. They produce over 20 wines and offer cooking lessons, accommodation, and folklore shows. "
Strumica,"Strumica lies in Eastern Macedonia with a number of great attractions worth exploring.   Enjoy hiking on Mt Belasica or head out to Smolare and Kolesino, two nearby waterfalls. There are also some stunning monasteries, including tranquil Veljusa and Vodoca.  Both are Byzantine and still occupied by both monks and nuns.  Be sure to check out the incredible frescos at both. From there, head to St. Bogorodica Eleusa, built in the 11th century, the healing spa of the Roman Therma, as well as St Leontuis. "
Ohrid Lake,"The largest town on Lake Ohrid, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ohrid has a remarkable history and heritage to share. At the top of the list are the frescoes inside Saint Sofia Church, the Ancient Theatre, St. Clement Church (13th century), and Tsar Samuil’s fortress – which has an unbelievable view over the city and lake. The surrounding mountains reach upwards of 2800m, which means that Ohrid is not only culturally significant, but naturally breath-taking. It’s no stretch at all to say that Ohrid showcases the best of Macedonia. It’s a good idea to use the town as base camp to explore the lake as well as its many surrounding towns and monasteries. Just 30km away is St. Naum’s, one of the richest and oldest monasteries in the country. "
River Drim in Struga,"A visit to Struga makes a great day trip from Ohrid. Nicknamed the “City of Poetry,” the town is relaxing and beautiful to stroll through.  The national anthem, “Denes nad Makedonija se raga,” was written by Vlado Maleski, a poet born in Struga. In fact, the first time the anthem was publically sung was in the town itself. You’ll enjoy the lively market at the Old Bazaar, St. George Church, the Halveti Teke, and a walk down Goce Delcev Street where you can see some well-preserved traditional houses. "
Monastery of St. Naum,"A 30 minute drive from Ohrid will take you to Sveti Naum, an impressive 10th century monastery which sits on a high outcropping over the lake. Most popular for its excellent frescos, it’s also a relaxing and rejuvenating place.  Some of the best religious paintings in all of the Balkans can be found here. You’ll love the panoramic views of the lake and if you have time, the rowboat tour down the Drim River is highly recommended. Wrap up the day by popping over to one of the islands for dinner. Because it encompasses so much of what is phenomenal about Macedonia, this is the perfect place to end your tour. "
Tikves Lake,"Built in 1968, Tikves Lake is both the largest and oldest man-made lake in the country. It’s close to Kavadarci and makes the perfect Sunday afternoon family picnic spot.  Scuba diving, sailing, kayaking, and canoeing are all on offer – plus you can paraglide or mountain bike in the summer and ski and snow board in the winter. If you like fishing, spend a morning trying to land the sheat-fish, which can grow to be over two metres long. The valley itself is so fertile that many orchards and vineyards dot the landscape. "
Kumanovo,"Outside of Skopje is Kumanovo.  It’s one of the larger cities in the country and has a fantastic blend of Macedonian and Serbian culture.  The Kumanovci are a feisty group and the town and outlying villages highlight the colourful multi-ethnic blend of Roman, Serbian, Albanian, and Turkish minorities. Check out Kostoperka Karpa, a unique rock formation, the Church of St George, the monument to  Batko Gjorgjija – a local , legendary, and much loved bohemian. "
Ifaty,"A single name for a duo of resorts, Ifaty (and its bigger brother of Mangily, also now confusingly referred to as just Ifaty too) is a stretch of sun-kissed onetime fishing villages on the south-western edge of Madagascar island. Famed for their luxurious hotel resorts and wide beaches of shining yellow sand, they draw some of the biggest crowds in the country. Most come for the rigmarole of sun, sea, sand and world-class snorkelling that&#8217;s offered by the Indian Ocean, while others head in to enjoy catamaran tours on the Mozambique Channel, sample uber-fresh fish curries and encounter the traditional reed villages of the coastal folk. "
Nosy Be,"Just a short hop, skip and a jump across the Indian Ocean waters from the town of Ambanja, gorgeous little Nosy Be is the place to go for Madagascar&#8217;s trademark beaches. Shining in hues of alabaster white in the coves and inlets that ring the shoreline here, they pop up beautifully around little fishing villages like Ambatoloaka, or come dotted with groups of swaying palm trees at Ambondrona. There are beach parties too, erupting each Sunday along the sands of Madirokely. And, Nosy Be&#8217;s popularity notwithstanding, there are chances for real seclusion to boot – just check out the far-flung islet of Orangea, languishing out at sea from the north-west coast. "
Nosy Mangabe,"Nestled deep between the coastal hills of Helodrano Antongila Bay, which carves its way inland on the north-eastern edge of Madagascar, the small island come nature reserve of Nosy Mangabe is a real must for any wildlife lovers heading to these parts. Famed for its booming populations of bug-eyed aye-aye lemurs, the spot is a picture of tropical perfection. Huge fig trees wrangle around groves of palms, ruffed lemurs meet mantella frogs in the undergrowth, and the green hills crash down into secluded bays of bright yellow sand. Boats to the island and all the necessary permits are available in Maroantsetra; the closest town on the mainland. "
Tsingy de Bemaraha,"A truly dramatic landscape of carved rocks and towering hoodoos, needle-like stone spires and colossal monoliths balanced tenuously atop cliffs, the Tsingy de Bemaraha is one of Madagascar&#8217;s most curious natural treasures. It can be found amidst the long green belt of nature reserves on the west coast, displaying its rugged karst landscapes where the inland highlands give way to the verdant hills closer to the shore. Today it&#8217;s also a UNESCO World Heritage Site; one tagged for its great biodiversity of dry deciduous forests, rare rock habitats, and the photogenic nature of the sweeping plateau within. "
Ranomafana National Park,"The natural jewel of Fianarantsoa and the home of Madagascar&#8217;s famous golden bamboo lemur, Ranomafana National Park draws thousands of people each year to its forest-clad reaches in the heart of the island&#8217;s eastern haunch. Sweeping down from misty montane forests to lowland plains, the territory is crisscrossed by mile upon mile of hiking track, carved out by roaring waterfalls and peppered with multi-coloured lizards. A word of warning: Ranomafana&#8217;s biggest draws lie deep between the mountains and forests, so be sure to bring sturdy boots and strong legs for this one! "
Isalo National Park,"The patchwork of carved rock gorges and winding canyons, blooming oases and palm groves that is the beautiful Isalo National Park can be reached after just a short trip out of either Toliara and Ihosy. Designated a protected area way back in 1962, this one&#8217;s extreme biodiversity and unique natural makeup are instantly recognisable. Visitors come to wonder at the windswept runiforme mountains and walk beneath towers of stacked stone. They come to see the rare crested ibis and meet ring-tailed lemurs in the wild. There are also more than 80 species of endemic birds to spot, along with the famous Canyon of Monkeys, with its dextrous sifakas inhabitants. "
Antananarivo,"Set more than 1,400 meters up in the very highland heart of the nation, the capital of Antananarivo comes brushed with chilly mountain breezes for most of the year. But those winds might just be the only cool thing about the cityscape, which today pulses with tooting traffic and shouting marketplaces. The old heart of the city still displays some traces of French colonialism, with its elegant – if age-stained – Parisian mansions cascading down a hillside in the midst of the town. There are old Malagasy palaces to explore too, along with the famous Croc Farm, and oodles of spice-scented curry houses to boot. "
Andasibe-Mantadia,"Within striking distance for day trippers from the capital, Andasibe-Mantadia is one of Madagacar&#8217;s most accessible national parks. It covers a vast swathe of verdant primeval rainforest, clocking up a whopping territory of more than 150 square kilometers in total. Spread over two separate areas, from the sprawling de Mantadia Reserve to the d&#8217;Analamazaotra Special Reserve, the whole area showcases a breathtaking array of biodiversity. There are inland crabs crawling through the forests, swinging diademed sifakas and even fluffy indri monkeys to see. Andasibe-Mantadia has oodles of hiking paths that offer treks between one and six hours. "
Ambohimanga,"Ambohimanga is a place deeply entwined with Malagasy national identity. Also called, simply, Royal Hill, it was the onetime home of the local kings. Expanded and added to throughout the 1800s, the mound of palaces and burial grounds, crumbling fortifications and regal tombs, was the kingpin of one of Madagascar&#8217;s four quadrants, and the place from which King Andrianampoinimerina launched his now-famed campaigns to re-unify Imerina following more than seven decades of civil war in the 18th century. Today, visitors can come on a day trip from the capital to tour the UNESCO spot, spying out the kingly court rooms and exquisite timber and stone rova (settlement) architecture. "
Zahamena National Park,"Draped in rainclouds and mist, clad in rolling canopies of emerald green, and hidden between the rising peaks on Madagascar&#8217;s eastern edge, the famous jewel of the rainforests of the Atsinanana comes in the form of the Zahamena National Park. One of the hardest protected areas in the country to get to, this area of just over 400 square kilometers is home to one of the most eclectic arrays of bird life. Yep, red owls and serpent eagles cruise through the waxy boughs and fern forests, meeting the white-eyed indri indri, dwarf lemurs and other curious simian life. Bed down in nearby Vavatenina or Ambatondrazaka for the best access to these wilds. "
Maroantsetra,"The favoured gateway to the Masoala National Park and the aforementioned wilds of Nosy Mangabe, age-old Maroantsetra makes its home right at the end of the great Bay of Antongil in north-east Madagascar. An earthy and interesting town, it&#8217;s laden with one throbbing marketplace that&#8217;s packed with sweet-smelling fruits and multi-coloured vegetables, and has crisscrossing streets of mud lined with tin-shack lean-tos. It&#8217;s also the place where the meanders of the Antainambalana River finally meet the Indian Ocean, giving the spot a laid-back riparian charm to boot. "
Ile Sainte Marie,"The Ile Sainte Marie is an elongated finger of land that stretches along the eastern edge of Madagascar, just across the whale-peppered waters of the Baie de Tintingue. The stuff of travel brochures and tropical postcards, it&#8217;s one of the most handsome enclaves of the country for sure. Most travelers will alight between the rickety jetties of Ambodifotatra, before breaking out to the secluded coves and beaches to the north and south. These tend to be powdered yellow sands dotted with big boulders and fringed with coconut palms, complete with the occasional resort hotel hiding between the mangroves. Also, don’t miss the pirate history, which is best seen at the old buccaneer cemetery! "
Morondava,"Sandwiched between the sandy beaches of the Kirindy Mitea National Park to the south and the spreading delta lands of the Andranomena Reserve to the north, it’s clear from the get-go that Morondava&#8217;s real pulls lie out of town. That doesn&#8217;t mean the center isn&#8217;t worth bedding down in – this seaside spot has some pretty little timber homes and earthy guesthouses, along with a great backpacker vibe. The piece de resistance is undisputed though. That honour goes to the revered Avenue of the Baobabs, which erupts in a medley of hulking trunks along the roadway to Belon&#8217;i Tsiribihina nearby – simply not to be missed! "
Masoala National Park,"Falanoucs, leaf-tailed geckos and rare lemurs all coalesce between the vast 2,300-sqaure-kilometers of land that is the Masoala National Park. Jutting out into the Indian Ocean in a mosaic of thick rainforests that cascade down to the crashing rollers of the sea from the cliffs of the Sava Region, it&#8217;s one of the largest and most hotly protected places in the nation. Illegal logging here has been a huge problem, even in recent years, but a UNESCO designation and increased eco-tourism is only set to improve matters. Today, visitors can come to walk along the famous Cap Est and Alohatrozana trails, to see the virgin forests that dress the shore along its whole length. "
Antsirabe,"Perched high up in the Madagascan highlands and soothed by the cool winds of the mountains, Antsirabe was an obvious choice for the French colonials who came here by the boatload during the heyday of colonialism. In their wake they built elegant Parisian-style mansions, raised Gothic cathedrals and laid wide boulevards with plane trees casting shade. They also tapped the healing and relaxation powers of the nearby hot springs, which are still one of the main attractions in the city. Hop aboard a local pousse-pousse (rickshaw) and check off the sites downtown, before heading to the Ranomafana baths to unwind in the natural waters. "
Van Buren,"Van Buren is a small town that gives tourists access to the beautiful St. John River Valley and an exclusive look at Acadian culture. The town retains its old, Acadian style by preserving old architecture and buildings like the blacksmith shop, wood and gristmills, a log chapel, and schoolhouse. New homes are restored or built in the same 1700s style, which is why the town is so pristine. You can easily spend a day walking down the Bangor and Aroostook Trail that goes weaves through Van Buren and into dense forests. Outdoor lovers will enjoy all the local hiking, snowmobiling, fishing, boating, and horseback riding. There are also a variety of cultural events all year round centered around live music and locally sourced food. "
Round Pond Public Reserve,"This coastal village is renowned for its hospitality and seaside charm. Many of the inns still operate with gas lanterns and nobody will blame you for feeling as though you’ve stepped back in time. There are antique shops, plenty of seafood restaurants (you need to try the lobster), and the picturesque Marshall Point Lighthouse. Nearby is the Round Pond Public Reserve, a serene lake surrounded by dense forest. The reserve attracts hikers, kayakers, fishermen, and other types of outdoorsmen. Walk along the Round Point Mountain Trail and keep your voice down for a chance at spotting local seabirds and other wildlife. "
Sebec,"With less than 700 people and located on the Sebec Lake, this little town is unassuming yet looks like it belongs on a postcard. Tall trees reflect on the mirror-calm lake most days, and the lifestyle is slow-paced and simple. It originally started as an old mill town during the early 1800s, founded by retired soldiers from the Revolutionary War. The best time to visit is just before autumn, when the leaves start changing to fire-toned hues yet the weather is still warm enough to enjoy exploring the nearby scenery. There’s not much to do in terms of shopping or dining, so it’s best to come when you simply want to enjoy free time. "
Hartland,"Walk around Hartland, and you might just mistake being on a movie set – especially if you come across the quaint gazebo. Hartland is a small town with stunning architecture and endless nearby natural beauty. Fishermen from all around the region often visit Hartland just for the fishing. At Great Moose Lake, you can expect to catch all types of fish including trout, bass, salmon, and brown bullhead. Once you’re done there, you can venture to Morrill Pond that has a small boat ramp and is stocked with trout, white perch, and chain pickerel. Of course, even if you’re not into fishing, you can enjoy boating on the calm water or exploring the woodlands surrounding the area. "
Kennebunkport,"No matter what time of the year you visit Maine, Kennebunkport is a small town you have to stop in – at least for the weekend. When it’s warm, visitors can go whale watching, visit caves, horseback ride, cycle around town, fish for lobster, and kayak to the local islands. Former president George H.W. Bush even had a summer home here! When the weather cools down, you can go window shopping at Cape Porpoise, go on a guided tour, visit the Goat Island Lighthouse, and collect seashells. The town is used to hosting tourists – yet never gets too crowded. Skip out on Kennebunkport, and you’ll regret it. "
Stonington,"Stonington is supported by the lobster and fishing industries, so you know there’s no better place to have New England seafood than here. Aside from the local fare, Stonington is a wonderful place to go boating, fishing, and is the best base for exploring Deer Isle, Isle de Haut, and the Wreck Island Preserve. Interestingly, this small town also attracts creatives and artists of all types. The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts features native artwork, there are tens of local galleries around, and you can watch live performances of theatre, dancing, and singing at the Stonington Opera House. If you’re looking for a destination that can double as a muse in Maine, head to Stonington. "
Phippsburg,"If you are interested in American history, then you’ll love Phippsburg. Near the town center is where the Popham Colony, the first English colony, settled in 1607 – one of the first American settlements. Though the settlement failed, there are still remnants of what life would have been like during those times. In another nod to history, visitors can stay in the 1774 Inn, a bed and breakfast that was built during 1774 and still has many of its original features. Stop by Popham Beach, a three-mile-long stretch of sand for sunbathers during the warmer months. Phippsburg also makes a great base for exploring the nearby town of Bath, Morse Mountain, and the Kennebec River. "
Rockport,"Rockport is no stranger to receiving accolades for its stunning small town appeal. This harbor town is serene, filled with historic sites, and is easy to get to. Boating enthusiasts can kayak, motorboat, or sail around the harbor or even go on a sunset dinner cruise around Penobscot Bay. The truly adventurous can even sail or drive to Thatcher Island for sights of the Rockport’s Twin Lights and the Halibut State Park. The Rockport Marine Park is also great for water-lovers who want to swim, fish, and play in the reserve. After a day out on the water, check into one of Rockport’s beautiful accommodation options and grab a fine lobster dinner in town. "
Brooklin,"Brooklin, a town of just under 1000 residents, is famous around the world for its wooden boats. The boat builders of Brooklin create boats ranging from wooden dinghies to luxurious yachts, and their craft can be seen all around the harbor. Visitors can sign up to learn how to build a wooden boat themselves. The town is also home to the great writer, E.B. White, where fans of his can see where he once lived and is now buried. There is also the Kneisel Hall for live music performances and the nearby Blue Hill Mountain area to explore and go berry picking. "
Eustis,"Adventure and outdoor travelers need to visit Eustis when coming to Maine. This small town is nearby the Bigelow Preserve, a 36,000-acre park with mountains and perfect for camping, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. It’s also nearby Sugarloaf Mountain Resort, the state’s largest ski mountain. Eustis is at the trailhead of two long-distance trails – the Northern Forest Canoe Trail that leads to Flagstaff lake and the Appalachian Trail that goes to the Bigelow Range. The town itself is family focused, safe, and friendly. For winter fun, come during the Polar Blast Festival that celebrates having fun in the snow. "
Allagash,"Whereas many small towns are lacking in culture due to their size, this isn’t the case for Allagash. This small town was settled in the early 1800s by Acadian pioneers making a living through the logging industry and their descendants still live in the town today. The heritage is distinctly shown through community events, the architecture, and even the local museum. Surrounded by woodlands, those who weren’t born in Allagash came here in search of tranquility. There are all types of artists including quiltmakers, sculptors, painters, musicians, and more creative types who feature their work all throughout the town – free for visitors to see. So if you love eclectic places with a lot of culture and natural beauty, Allagash is a must-see for you. "
Eastport,"Geography buffs will get a kick out of visiting the most eastern point in all the United States of America. This small town has more character than its neighboring resort areas and has been experiencing somewhat of a renaissance over the past few years. Visit Eastport to see a humble seaside town with a thriving cultural arts scene. Watch performances at the Eastport Arts Center and visit the Tides Institute and Museum of Art for displays of local artwork. The town is also uniquely positioned along the sea, where strong currents and tides create a hospitable climate for all types of fish. The fish lure all types of eagles and sea lions, making Eastport one of the best towns in Maine to go wildlife watching. "
<br />Fryeburg,"You could easily spend a few days in Fryeburg without getting bored. This small town has twelve public parks, hiking trails, and is on the shores of the peaceful Saco River. Outdoor enthusiasts can hike along the Jockey Cap Trail, go birdwatching, kayaking, swimming, fishing, and more. Architecture and history buffs will love walking across the Hemlock Bridge, built in 1857. As far as accommodation options go, Fryeburg offers a variety that will suit every travel style and budget. Look into checking in at the Old Saco Inn on a 65-acre reserve, the Stone Mountain House built in the late 19th century, or at one of the eco-retreats. "
Vinalhaven,"Vinalhaven is Maine’s largest offshore island community that’s the perfect fit for those who can’t get enough time on the water. From here, you can go on all types of seaside excursions like kayaking, canoeing, birdwatching, swimming in the quarries, swimming in the sea, clamming, and more. The view of the town from the sea is one of the most beautiful sights in all of Maine, especially when the sun is low above the horizon. Aside from seafaring, Vinalhaven is home to all types of art galleries and even features live theatre performances. There are tens of gift shops to peruse and a Saturday morning flea market that attracts nearly everyone in town. "
Acadia National Park,"This small town has a history of shipbuilding, lumbering, and fishing that can still be seen through the town’s culture and lifestyle today. Trenton is a town that is punctuated by the nature that surrounds it and is perfect for travelers searching for a place to get back to nature. There are plenty of campgrounds, hiking trails, and other outdoor service facilities. It’s also a great base for seeing the Acadia National Park, Thompson Island, and Mount Desert Island. Best of all, visitors can root for their favorite wood chopper at the Great Maine Lumberjack Show, where lumberjacks compete in sawing, log rolling, and racing to chop wood. The region is also renowned for being home to – in addition to lumberjacks – all types of wildlife like caribou, moose, deer, and waterfowl. "
Liwonde National Park,"The most accomplished wildlife spotting and safari area in all of Malawi makes its home along the courses of the Shire River. A vast reserve of flood plains and wetland swamps, of swaying grass fields and baobab groves, it&#8217;s a picture of the beautiful backcountry of East Africa. A smattering of good holidaying lodges offers easy access to the park, where walking and motorized safaris showcase everything from bush elephants to side-striped jackals, hyena packs to impalas, waterbucks, baboons and more. There&#8217;s also a great diversity of flora to witness, from huge and waxy orchids to pretty lily-spotted ponds. "
School in Blantyre,"A business-minded metropolis of nearly one million people, Blantyre is the only real rival to Lilongwe when it comes to competing for the crown for the economic kingpin of the nation. However, history also runs deep here, and the town boasts more than 150 years since it was first established by missionaries working for the Church of Scotland – hence the moniker: a namesake of Blantyre on the edge of the highlands back in the UK. Visitors can come and spy out old structures like the Mandala House, or get a feel for the invigorated Malawian economy at the Malawi Stock Exchange and the various tobacco packing factories that have popped up in recent decades. "
Kasungu National Park,"The Kasungu National Park is one of East Africa&#8217;s more off-the-beaten-track nature reserves. Encompassing a whopping 2,100 square kilometers of land, where the rolling plateaus of western Malawi give way to the borderlands with Zambia, the area is a mosaic of swaying savannah and bush, sporadic miombo woodland and dusty plains. Once known for its booming population of African elephants, Kasungu has been hit by hefty poaching problems in recent decades. However, a clutch of lodges around the lake waters of Lifupa have helped raise the ecotourism profile, and safari going here is now all but back on track. "
Lilongwe,"Set to the distinct scents of recently-harvested tobacco and wafts of petrol fumes from the endless streams of traffic that pulse through the dusty streets, this nigh on one-million-strong capital represents the beating political and commercial heart of Malawi. Linger a few days and you&#8217;re bound to unearth its wonders, which range from a particularly well-kempt nature reserve on the edge of the city (the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre) to a heady marketplace that throbs with haggling sellers touting everything from stacks of green mangoes to whittled wood figurines to multi-coloured pulses right throughout the week. There are also oodles of lively local beer bars to kick-back in with a regionally brewed Carlsberg when you get thirsty! "
Lake Malawi National Park,"Once trodden by the revered Scottish expeditionary and missionary, David Livingstone, the lands of the Lake Malawi National Park are a must for both nature lovers and history buffs. Nestled between he verdant, sylvan hillsides that ring the shores of the country&#8217;s largest lake, they encompass both freshwater habitats (famed for their uniquely evolved fish species) and swathes of land to boot. Baboons and antelopes can be spotted strolling the shore, while a clutch of great safari lodges can be found on the reserve&#8217;s various islands, from pretty Domwe to handsome Mumbo. There are also the relics of old missionary settlements to see. "
Nyika National Park,"A world of montane landscapes that extends across great swathes of the central Malawian plateaux, the Nyika National Park is the largest of its kind in the entire country, and one of the most unique natural habitats in East Africa besides. Known as the source of headwaters for many of the region&#8217;s river ways, it&#8217;s a place of verdant grass plains and colourful orchid beds, where elephants roam and water buffalo coalesce between the scrub. Horse riding safaris are uber-popular with visitors, while hiking and bird spotting remain other major draws. "
Karonga,"Shrouded by the dusty mountains of the Malawian north and clutching to the far-flung edge of great Lake Malawi just a short jaunt from the Tanzanian border, the welcoming little town of Karonga is a great place to spend a night or two in this less-visited corner of the nation. Expect banks, good bus connections and a clutch of earthy little guesthouses: all you&#8217;ll need to stock up before moving on. And then there are the fossils, which are perhaps Karonga&#8217;s single most impressive claim to fame. These come in the form of huge Malawisaurus remains, now lurking in the exhibition rooms of the local Culture and Museum Centre. "
Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve,"Nkhotakota sits nestled right in the heart of Malawi&#8217;s central backcountry. Verdant and pretty, it&#8217;s dressed in green dashes of miombo woods, cut-through by several winding rivers (each on their way to join the waters of Lake Malawi itself) and backed by its eponymous Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve. It&#8217;s here that most travelers will head, to seek out the acclaimed safari lodges that clutch the edge of the waters, to wonder at tropical birds and see elephants, buffalo and maybe even leopards in the wild. "
Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve,"Rising like a great backbone of stone from the dusty plains of southern Malawi, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the border with Mozambique, the hulking mass of stone and rock that is the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve has to be one of the country&#8217;s most breathtaking. Hailed as the highest peak in the nation &#8211; and the region as a whole, in fact – its whopping height of 3,000 meters above sea level is enough to host a whole array of different habitats. The most famous is perhaps the woodlands of the endangered widdringtonia African cypress tree, which pepper the ridges sporadically as they rise to meet the sky. "
Zomba,"The gateway to its eponymous plateau, Zomba sits on the edge of the Shire Highlands. Once the hub of British Central Africa, the town has a rich colonial past, with interesting little frontispieces belying the Anglo influence on corners throughout the place. However, it&#8217;s the wildernesses that erupt around the city that draw most of the travelers. These come peppered with rare cypress trees and juniper bushes, and roll out to meet verdant forests and highland lakes as they go. Many opt to hike to the summit of the great escarpment, where sweeping views of Mulunguzi River and the Shire River can be enjoyed from the lookouts. "
Likoma Island,"Enveloped by the waters of Lake Malawi, but nestled on the Mozambican side of the border, the picturesque reaches of Likoma Island are an exclave of Malawi proper. Famed as the onetime headquarters of Livingstone, the spot is steeped in colonial history. This is evident with the likes of the Gothic rises of the Likoma town cathedral, and in the steady stream of tourists that head this way. However, many also come for the natural side of things. Why? Well, Likoma is also famed for its crystal-clear shore waters and unspoilt coastline, where the occasional fishing skiff offers the only interruption to a day spent snorkelling in the company of cichlid fish. "
Mzuzu,"The largest settlement in northern Malawi comes in the form of frenetic Mzuzu; a large and uncompact city that serves as the transport hub for the whole Mzimba District. Popular with travelers stopping over on their way to the Tanzanian border, the city is also a great place to stock up and rest before trips to the northern banks of Lake Malawi, to the manmade Viphya Forest, or the acclaimed Nyika National Park. The city itself has some interesting botanical gardens, and oodles of adventure tour providers that can organise treks in the surrounding mountains and hills. "
Mangochi,"Mangochi is the hub for perhaps Malawi&#8217;s most-visited section of lakeshore. It runs south to north between the town and the aforementioned Lake Malawi National Park; a dash of palm-peppered Swahili fishing towns and accomplished resorts. However, there&#8217;s also history here, and it&#8217;s still possible to see the great Hotchkiss gun that once downed the German naval ship Hermann von Wissmann in WWII, wonder at a colonial clock tower raised by Queen Victoria, and trace the old past of the Malawi-Zanzibar trade routes from centuries gone by. "
Chitimba,"Chitimba is one-part rustic Malawian lake village and one-part upcoming safari lodge. Nestled along the sandy stretches of shoreline that fringe Lake Malawi south of Mzuzu city, it&#8217;s got pretty much unrivalled access to the dramatic Rift Valley landscapes that dominate the region here. The hiking is top-notch, with tracks weaving in and out of the undulating hills and the dusty bushlands. There&#8217;s excellent wildlife spotting too, along the tracks heading up to Manchewe Falls and Mount Chombe, not to mention a chance to have a cultural encounter with a traditional East African shaman! "
Chongoni,"Known primarily for its rich histories and pre-historic arrays of rock art, the UNESCO-attested spot of Chongoni is perfect for any culture vultures traveling through Malawi. Reaching heights of nearly 2,000 meters above sea level with the peaks of the Dedza mountains, the area has revealed evidence of habitation since the early Stone Age. This is found in the caverns at spots like Chentcherere and Namzeze, displaying animist religious elements and the old artworks of East Africa&#8217;s onetime hunter-gatherer nomad people. The far-flung reaches of Mphunzi Mountain form the westernmost extend of the UNESCO area, and have some of the most impressive frescos to boot. "
Kuala Lumpur,"Kuala Lumpur comes spiked at the center by the two great spires of the Petronas Towers, packed with markets and heady hawker bazaars down Petaling Street, throbbing with the energy of Bukit Bintang – the entertainment city – and awash with the scents of everything from frying Chinese chow mien to sizzling Portuguese fish barbeques. It&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s great multicultural metropolises, with lantern-lit Chinatown butting up to districts of Nepalese curry houses and Indian thali kitchens. Apart from the breathtaking views of the cityscape from the countless sky bars, you can visit the mysterious Batu Caves and some acclaimed Islamic art institutions. "
Malacca,"The red-hued churches and colonial frontispieces that fringe the tight-knit lanes of enchanting Malacca remain unquestionably one of Malaysia&#8217;s great draws. Created over decades of colonial rule by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and then the British, the city seen today was once a mighty trading powerhouse on the edge of the Malay Peninsula. With control of the Malacca Strait, it saw everything from silk transports to spice convoys to military contingents pass through its ports. Today, there are immersive maritime museums to help unravel this past, along with one pandemonius night market down Jonker Walk – one of the best in the country! "
George Town,"Penang is oft hailed as Southeast Asia writ small. It&#8217;s easy to see why. In the city of George Town, clicking rickshaws weave past smoky Cantonese kitchens, blue-hued mansions from the 19th century, and the aged remnants of a vainglorious British past – it&#8217;s no wonder the whole place comes under UNESCO World Heritage designation. You can expect one awesome medley of food to try too, including Indian curries and Chinese pancakes. And then there are the beaches, which glisten in deep blues and golden yellows at Batu Feringghi, and come lined with lanky coconut palms on the edge of Jerejak Island. "
Gunung Mulu National Park,"The weathered hoodoos and ancient ridges of Gunung Mulu National Park rarely fail to capture the imagination. The park itself (another UNESCO site) represents one of those last enclaves of untrodden land, and is one of the hardest reserves to get to in all of Borneo – you have to take a heart-thumping plane ride down to the asphalt of tiny Mulu Airport, or a 12-hour riverboat between snake-infested jungles. "
Langkawi,"Straddling the border with Thailand where the Andaman Sea becomes the Malaccan Straits in the extreme north of the country, Langkawi is a laid-back, lazy place that offers a real dose of the tropics. Riddled with iconic beaches, like the watersports haven of Pantai Cenang, or the secluded, boulder-dotted sands of Pantai Kok, it&#8217;s established itself as the place to come for sun, sea, sand, SCUBA, and some pampering. For the last, you can head to the 5-star all-inclusive resorts that hide in the coconut groves of Datai Bay. And for adventure, you can pull on the boots and trek to the gushing Seven Wells, or hit the panoramic SkyBridge atop the jungles. "
Taman Negara National Park,"Taman Negara is the sprawling green jewel that sits at the heart of the Malay Peninsula. Covering a whopping 4,300 square kilometers, it ranges across primeval rainforest (some of the oldest established woodland in the world, some say) and winding rivers where elephants can be spotted basking on the muddy banks. "
Cameron Highlands,"Soaring at a height of over 1,000 meters above the lower reaches of the Malay Peninsula, the hill station known as the Cameron Highlands rarely fails to take the breath away. It sweeps across the plateaus of the mighty Main Range, midway between Penang and KL, rolling out in verdant pockets of rainforest and emerald-green tea fields as it goes. The unique microclimate and cool temperatures that dominate on the highlands make the region the perfect incubator for interesting plant and animal life, while oodles of worn hiking routes promise awesome vistas of Batu Brinchang and the ramshackle tea villages, and even cultural encounters with the local Orang Asli aborigines. "
Turtle Beach,"The Perhentian Islands have all the good looks and sun-kissed beauties you&#8217;d expect of an archipelago set at the entrance to the Thai Gulf. Encompassed by sparkling dashes of coral reef, they are usually accessed by boat from Kuala Besut. The location on the east coast of Malaya keeps them void of the same booming crowds that descend on Penang, which is great if you&#8217;re after long and lazy days kicking-back between Turtle Beach and Coral Bay. But that&#8217;s not it. There&#8217;s SCUBA diving aplenty, with famous sites like Pinnacle and Sugar Wreck offering great visibility. There&#8217;s jungle hiking paths, where you&#8217;ll keep the company of oversized lizards and snakes. "
Semenggoh Nature Reserve,"Semenggoh continues to reign as one of the fabled natural jewels of Borneo. Located just on the fringes of Kuching city, it spills into the virgin rainforests that rise with the great inland peaks of Sarawak. Between its borders are towering teak trees and swinging jungle vines, all peppered with blooming papayas and banana trees. Those are munched on by the resident pack of 25 orangutans, which are the main reason so many thousands of people flock this way each year! (There&#8217;s a famous reserve on the grounds of Semenggoh that allows some of the most up-close-and-personal encounters with these fascinating simians.) "
Bako National Park,"Jutting its way out into the pearly waters of the South China Sea on the other side of Kuching from Semenggoh, Bako National Park is also worth a visit – especially if you&#8217;ve come to Malaysia for the wild jungles and beautiful backcountry. The landscapes here can change dramatically from the coast to the inland, with chiseled rock stacks and sheer-cut cliffs by the ocean, and dense forests with mossy undergrowth dominating the backcountry. That makes for one awesome array of fauna, including formidable monitor lizards and elusive proboscis monkeys. Walking trails cover the whole park, weaving past the woods, the mangroves and the coastal coves alike. "
Kuching,"For many travelers, Kuching will be that first taste of eastern Malaysia and Borneo. And where better to start? This 200-year-old city is the capital of Sarawak state, and comes with a backstory of British colonialism and sultanate rule. You can see that in buildings like the whitewashed Astana, and in the bustling worshipping halls of the Jamek Mosque. Kuching is also known for its diversity &#8211; Chinese markets throb with five spice here; Indian kitchens churn out paneer fries and bhajis there. Oh, and that&#8217;s not even mentioning the town&#8217;s enticing proximity to wonders like Bako National Park and the Semenggoh orangutan reserve! "
Sipadan,"You&#8217;ll have to venture far into the east to discover the legendary tropical treasures of Sipadan: Malaysia&#8217;s sole oceanic island, and a veritable picture-perfect diving destination that&#8217;s just waiting for the travel brochure photographers to pass through. Cotton-white sands greet the few boaters that make the trip from Borneo&#8217;s mainland, while craggy hills of jungle-dressed rock top the isle itself. However, the real treats here lie under the water. "
Lambir Hills National Park,"Sat just a stone&#8217;s throw from the border with Brunei, the Lambir Hills National Park is one of the smallest in Malaysia. However, size doesn’t seem to matter here, because visitors still flock to wonder at the gushing waterfalls and old-growth rainforest that are packed into the nooks and crevices of the valleys. Wooden bridges, winding staircases cut into the rock, and maintained boardwalks, all make it a great place to pull on the walking boots. Deep inside the reserve are families of rare primates and the paradisiacal cataracts of the Lambir Hills Waterfall – just wait until that one reveals itself! "
Johor Bahru,"Johor Bahru sits on the very edge of Singapore, right at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. Over the decades, it&#8217;s garnered a rep as just an administrative visa town, which is far too simple a moniker for a city that&#8217;s riddled with cultural attractions and great shopping. Check out the Old Chinese Temple that stands, Zen-like, in the midst of the downtown, and don’t miss the elegant colonial-style towers of the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque. "
Taiping,"Super-wet Taiping sits in the rain shadow of the Perak hills, not far from the sunny beaches and multicultural streets of George Town and Penang. Like Penang, this city has been influenced greatly by settlers from China over the centuries, and the spot was once the focus of a mass exodus of Cantonese and San folk, who came in the tin rush to mine the nearby ridges. Today, it&#8217;s got some pretty urban gardens and parklands to explore – don&#8217;t miss relaxing Maxwell Hill, the mirror-like waters of Taiping Lake Gardens, or the sobering Taiping War Cemetery. Meanwhile, the town center displays a medley of colonial-era facades and timber Asian builds, all of which hide local cookhouses and emporiums. "
Islamic Centre,"Thrumming with scooters and cars and Indian bazaars stacked with coconuts and spice, the city of Male – the capital of the Maldives atolls – has the frenetic feel of a place crammed into a slot that&#8217;s too small for it. And that&#8217;s because it is. Although rarely visited (most travelers bypass the city on seaplanes heading straight for their resort), the town is crammed onto a pint-sized islet in the North Male Atoll. It manages to fit some fascinating sights between its streets though, like the 17th-century Friday Mosque and the gold-tipped Islamic Centre. Male Market is another must – just be sure get your haggling skills up to scratch. "
Hulhumale Island,"Sat just across the sparkling waters from the capital of Male, the island of Hulhumale is forever growing and growing as more and more land is reclaimed to house the sprawling urban tendrils of the city. It&#8217;s also the home of the Velana International Airport, which is the main gateway to these paradisiacal islands for most. However, don&#8217;t be put off by how all that sounds – Hulhumale is actually a charming place. It&#8217;s got a gorgeous – if artificial &#8211; beach on its eastern haunch, a clutch of leafy neighborhoods, a glass-topped mosque, and planned promenade walkways above the Indian Ocean. "
Maafushi,"Maafushi might not have the sprawling luxury resorts and opulent 5-star hotels that many of its nearby brothers do, but it&#8217;s got plenty of charm. Sadly ravaged in the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the place has been busy rebuilding its salt-washed fishing jetties and industrious sailor huts in the last decade. Something that&#8217;s helped is the opening up of rights to local guesthouses, which is transforming Maafushi into one of the top off-beat island getaways for budget travelers. Of course, you can expect gorgeous beaches backed with palms, lapping waves, and a clutch of homey little coffee shops on the shore. "
Utheemu,"Sat on the far northern reaches of the Haa Alif Atoll, itself the northernmost of all the Maldivian island chains, the beautiful site of Utheemu holds a special place in the history of this archipelago nation. That&#8217;s because it was once the home of the revered Sultan Mohamed Thakurufaanu – the leader who&#8217;s credited with driving out Portuguese invaders from the isles in the late 16th century. "
Feydhoo,"Feydhoo&#8217;s story is a curious one. In the 19th century, the people now living between the leafy streets and tight-knit housing blocks here were the inhabitants of nearby Gan island (more on that one later). When the British came in the run up to WWII, Gan was transformed into an airbase, and the locals were shipped out to live on the next island along in the Seenu Atoll. That was Feydhoo, which is today a pretty picture of lived-in Maldivian life. Come and stroll the winding walkways and sample seafood curries with the locals – the welcome is always warm. "
Maradhoo,"Joined at the hip to aforementioned Feydhoo by a seaside causeway that runs just above the coral-fringed shores of the Seenu Atoll, Maradhoo is a major link in the island chain that starts with Gan to the east. Long and thin, it juts out into the Indian Ocean like a finger fringed with narrow beachfronts and swaying groves of coconut palms. As in Feydhoo, the locals are laid-back and lovely, and the cuisine is spicy and rich in seafood. "
Veligandu Island,"Romantic sunsets glow red and yellow over the lapping waters of the Indian Ocean; cocktails clink in the resort&#8217;s luxurious bar; sea kayaks bob on the turquoise shoreline, and crystal-clear waves roll in softly from the inland lagoon. Welcome to uber-beautiful Veligandu Island, which has long been championed as one of the top destinations in the Maldives for couples. Honeymooners and newly-weds are a common site on this long, thin finger of land on the western edge of the North Ari Atoll, and there are plenty of opulent seaside villas and suites to match. "
Banana Reef,Many travelers heading to the islands of the Maldives will be coming for one thing and one thing only: diving. And there&#8217;s hardly a single better place to don the SCUBA gear and wetsuits in the country than at the Banana Reef. This fruit-shaped dash of multi-colored corals and seaweed-clad sandbanks lies underwater between the isles of the North Male Atoll. 
Thulusdhoo Island,"It’s the spirit of the salt-washed Caribbean that seems to drive Thulusdhoo Island. Largely undiscovered, this speck in the Male Atolls is ringed by wide spaces of sand from which bulbous coconut trunks sprout by the hundred. The beaches are – naturally – great, and the locals love to draw in their fading fishing boats to flint up a good sizzling seafood barbeque now and then. That all fits perfectly with the other pastime of travelers on Thulusdhoo: surfing. Look for the fun left-hand rollers that turn into barrels off of Villingilimathi Huraa close by. "
Fuvahmulah,"Fuvahmulah promises something a little different to the rest of the Maldivian atolls. For starters, this speck on the map of the Indian Ocean doesn’t really have any near neighbors, and it occupies an atoll all of its own. It&#8217;s also peppered with the occasional inland lake, which is a rare sight to see in this flat-lying country. Meanwhile the sandbanks that ring popular Banging Beach make for some crashing rollers and refreshing salt-spray (a break from the usual relaxing lapping lagoons), and the proximity to the Earth&#8217;s equator means steamy weather throughout the year. "
Alimatha Island,"Perched on the eastern edge of the Maldives, in the famous Felidhe Atoll, Alimatha is a great tourist island that offers luxury cabanas, untouched stretches of pristine sandy beach, and – most importantly – some of the most celebrated SCUBA diving spots around. The resort that covers the island can often be seen packed with eager divers, who all come to seek out the pretty coral groves and sea walls that surround the shores. These are packed with jackfish, morays and eels, and are known for their high visibility and popular night diving packages. "
Hithadhoo,"Large (at least for a Maldivian island) and highly-populated (again, at least for a Maldivian island), this sub-section of Addu City in the old Seenu Atoll can be reached on the same causeways that connect Gan to Maradhoo. On its southern edge, the place is given away to mangroves and marshes and shrub land, while the north side of the island is packed with cafes and bakeries and the occasional set of looming minarets that rise from the local mosques. "
Kuredu,"Kuredu is the self-proclaimed jewel of the Lhaviyani Atoll, which makes its home in the central-north reaches of the Maldivian archipelago. A boomerang-shaped isle, it&#8217;s entirely covered by a single resort, which offers rustic bamboo shacks and rows of those ubiquitous over-water bungalows with verandahs above the waves. The whole place is completely surrounded by its own private fringing of powdery sand, and is considered one of the most advanced SCUBA and snorkeling destinations in the country – strong currents and high waves often make it difficult to see the manta rays and tropical schools. Unusually, Kuredu also plays host to a full 9-hole golf course. "
Gan,"Gan is primarily known for its airport, which is the second-largest airport in the entire Maldives and a famous former airbase for the British Royal Air Force during WWII. Today, the island has shed its old military importance in favor of tourism, and it&#8217;s slowly rising to become one of the most popular spots in the Addu Atoll. "
Kunfunadhoo Island,"If you&#8217;re after the fabled luxury and romance of the Maldives, then it’s likely that the opulent resort on Kunfunadhoo Island won&#8217;t disappoint &#8211; it&#8217;s continually hailed as the most indulgent place to stay in the country. Visitors enter through a thatched timber great hall that hides between groves of coconut palms. From there, it&#8217;s onto the cocktail decks that soar on stilts above the jungle, or out to the beaches where candles flicker in the sultry sea breeze. Add in a couple of infinity pools, swim-up bars, and the chance to dine on a private little sandbank with only the Indian Ocean waves as a backing track, and it&#8217;s easy to see why this one&#8217;s so popular! "
Timbuktu,"For many a Berber trader and Bedouin caravan man Timbuktu marked the end of the arduous trek across the shifting sand dunes of the great Sahara. Evoking mystery and magic and the feel of far-flung exoticism, even the name conjured up images of dusty bazaars where spices and sabres and strange folk trinkets rattled and scented the air. Today, Timbuktu is hardly the puzzling, perplexing enigma of place it once was; but there are traces of the old days. Find them between the criss-crossing grids of sand-caked streets; see them in the muddy walls of the Sankore Mosque; or discover them underneath the spiked rises of the Djingareiber. "
Gao,"Gao&#8217;s fortunes have ebbed and flowed over the centuries like the ups and downs of a yoyo. Once the imperial heart of the great Songhai Empire, the town was later almost entirely abandoned in favour of the new capital at aforementioned Timbuktu. But Gao clung to life from its place in the very midst of the dusty Sahel. Its tenacious locals maintained their mud-brick, mat-built yurts and life went on. Today, that makes Gao a great place to glimpse the earthy, ancient character of Mali, while craft markets, the acclaimed Sahel Museum, and 15th-century sepulchres like the Askia Tomb (yep, it&#8217;s supposed to look like Egypt&#8217;s pyramids!) add a whole host of cultural draws to the mix. "
Bamako,"Get the haggling valves and the shopping glands ready for that trip to Bamako: Mali&#8217;s largest and most frenetic city, where bazaars touting everything from carved folklore figurines to stacks of pungent spices cluster around the street corners and the sun-baked squares. The nation&#8217;s capital, there&#8217;s something undeniably likable about this sprawling metropolis of more than 1.5 million. It&#8217;s got palpable energy and an indelible lived-in feel. The nightlife pulses to a medley of West African samba; the jazz bars are packed with beer drinkers on the weekends; fried plantains sizzle on grills from neighbourhood to neighbourhood; tuk-tuks purr, and traffic toots! "
Grand Mosque of Djenne,"There are few sites in all of Mali – nay, all of north-west Africa – as impressive as the historic city of Djenné. Crowned at the center by the adobe rises of one fascinating Great Mosque, it is known for its distinctive mud-brick architecture and long history as a spot on the old caravan routes across the Sahel and Sahara. Made rich by the passing of minerals and precious metals (and – of course – slaves), the town boomed during the 15th and 16th centuries. The great worshipping house in its heart stands as testimony to the revered religious center Djenné became (even though it&#8217;s a later reconstruction of an older mosque), while the nearby archaeological excavations at Djenné-Djenno have shown the town to be one of the oldest in the entire Niger basin. "
Mopti,"Straddling the courses of the Bani River, just a stone&#8217;s throw from where that desert-shrouded tributary meets the mighty Niger, Mopti has positioned itself as one of Mali&#8217;s most important riparian ports. But Mopti is also more than just an up-river trading center – it&#8217;s also the gateway to the fascinating tribal territories of Dogon, which come peppered with adobe villages and the semi-nomadic folk of the Bandiagara Escarpment. There are oodles (and we mean oodles) of tour providers in Mopto, offering trips into this wild hinterland for cultural encounters, while boat trips to Timbuktu and sightseeing outings around the marketplaces and grand central mosques are also on the menu. "
Ségou,"Small little Ségou is a town of just over 130,000 people. It was once the beating epicentre of the Bambara Kingdom – a power that ruled over the lands of central Mali until around the turn of the 19th century. Today, its prowess and capital title are gone, but the city still has a few relics from that glorious time. Check out the tomb of Biton Mamary Coulibaly, the onetime monarch of the Bambaras, or the bustling port sides, which were once the trading powerhouse of the town. Ségou is also famed for its wealth of charming French colonial architecture. This can be found fringing the inner streets in a medley of Parisian facades and romantic governmental houses. "
Mount Hombori,"Rising in a wall of ochre-hued stone from the midst of the Sahelian wilds of south-central Mali, the great escarpment of rock known as Mount Hombori is like West Africa&#8217;s answer to Australia&#8217;s Uluru. It hulks above the horizon just a short distance from the town of the same name; a place of creaking wagons, winding alleyways and low-rise rock homes inhabited by the welcoming Dogon peoples. The biggest pull is certainly the great bluff though, and travelers now flock here to join intrepid 4X4 excursions into the sands, or to unearth the fascinating past currently being uncovered by archaeologists in the cave systems that carve their way deep into the mountain&#8217;s subterrane. "
Sikasso Market,"Sikasso is, and always has been, a mercantile town at heart. Nestled close to the multi-state join of Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Guinea, it&#8217;s benefited from a location that&#8217;s able to connect Africa&#8217;s landlocked heart with the ports that pepper the Atlantic seaboard. That trading history still pops up today, between the throbbing and frenetic fruit and veg markets that erupt ad hoc on virtually every block right throughout the week. And Sikasso also has one other claim to fame. In the late 19th century it was raised to the status of imperial capital; an honour decided on by king Tieba Traoré, whose own mother hailed from the spot. The rises of Mamelon Hill are the place to go to trace that story. "
"Kayes, Mali","Delineated by the meanders of the Senegal River, Kayes continues to bustle and thrum to the sound of market traders and salesmen. In fact, the passage of goods was the very raison d&#8217;être (notice the language) for the town, which was first built up by the French in the 1880s to facilitate the movement of produce to and fro from neighbouring West African countries. Travelers can come and wallow in the lively vibes of the place, seek out little trinkets and multi-coloured fruits and vegetables in the market, and sip coffees in the shadow of pretty Parisian-style builds. And away from the town there are even more points of interest, like the Félou Falls, the roaring cataracts of the Gouina Falls, and the relics of the formidable Medina Fort. "
Boucle du Baoulé National Park,"Sprawling out over nearly one million hectares in the middle of West Africa&#8217;s wildlife-rich Sudano-Guinean zone, the Boucle du Baoulé National Park is unquestionably one of the jewels of the Malian hinterland. The territory can be found close to the town of Kayes, cut through by rising ridges of Sahelian rocks and peppered with the remains of countless pre-historic troglodyte settlements. And despite recent troubles scaring away most of the eco-tourists, the fauna has hardly changed. Expect giraffes and rare simians, gazelles and even the occasional lion! "
Ansongo,"Occupying the western edge of the great nature reserve which shares its name (and the name of the town of Menaka on the far eastern side of the park&#8217;s boundaries), Ansongo is perhaps the youngest of all the places on this list. Far from being one of Mali&#8217;s fabled imperial centers, this one was purpose-built back in 1996. The reason? To cultivate the fertile Sahelian plains that roll out to the north, west, east and south. That means visitors can spot camel herds grazing and sorghum grasses swaying all along the flood plains of the Niger River here. And when it&#8217;s time to hit the aforementioned reserve of Faune D&#8217;Ansongo-Menake, you can look forward to gazelles and hippos, crocs and sand cats. "
"Kidal, Mali","One of the major hot points in the recent factional struggles that have beset Mali, Kidal sits deep in the region of the Azawad – the territory that unilaterally declared independence back in 2012 to trigger some of the bloodiest conflicts the heart of central West Africa has seen in recent years. However, its lately troubles aside, Kidal remains a place steeped in the traditions of the Tuaregs nomad folk, who still inhabit the vast sand plains of the greater Kidal Region. And the city showcases their traditions too, in both architecture and craft making. Oh, and be sure to check out the remnants of the French colonial fortress in the city before departing! "
Douentza,"Encompassed by otherworldly landscapes of carved rock bluffs and dust-devil-scarred plains, the region of Douentza is a great place to get to grips with the wildernesses that characterise the Malian Sahel. Douentza town sits at the heart of it all, ticking over with its sleepy Berber vibes and small marketplaces. Another point of great contention during Mali&#8217;s recent upheavals, this one has flitted between control of the Azawad liberators, the government and various Islamist groups in the past couple of years. And while the military struggles continue to simmer, the hinterland here continues to host the traipsing Gourma elephants, who pass this way on their annual migration – what a sight! "
Bandiagara,"Like Mopti before it, Bandiagara is the place to go for cultural encounters with the Dogon folk of the Malian plateaux. Little more than a trading town with a few humble marketplaces and emporiums touting traditional Dogon trinkets and foodstuffs, the real draws actually lie away from the center here – except for that interesting Toucouleur imperial building on the central drag! We&#8217;re talking about the UNESCO-attested reaches of the great Bandiagara Escarpment. This land of verdant plains and rock-ribbed cliffs is steeped in tribal history. You&#8217;ll see the abandoned hamlets of the Tellem folk, mud-caked mosques carved into the mountains, and some of the most beautiful backcountry in the region! "
"Taoudenni, Slabs of Salt","Taoudenni really is like nothing else in Mali. Languishing out in the sun-scorched heart of the Sahara Desert, it continues to function for one purpose only: salt mining. The settlement itself is actually constructed on the dried-up bed of an old saline lake. Workers come to carve great slabs of salt from the earth, which are then loaded onto some of the last remaining camel caravans in the world and trekked south to Mopti and other trading cities. There&#8217;s also the ruins of an old and infamous prison to see here, built in the 1960s by the onetime ruler Moussa Traoré. "
Valletta,"Valletta is the capital of Malta thanks to the famous defeat of the Ottoman Turks during the Great Siege of 1565.  Built on a peninsula in the eastern part of the country, with a population around 6000, the entire town is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It sits on top of Mount Sceberras and has wonderful examples of baroque architecture dating from the 16th century. The stand out of these is St. John’s Cathedral and other auberges’ and bastions all built by the Knights of St. John. Valletta is the largest harbour town in Malta and from The Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens you’ll get incredible views of the Grand Harbour. If you’ve got the opportunity, the Maltese Carnival, which lasts three days, is phenomenal. "
Sliema,"Just 5k from Valletta, Sliema is the Maltese hub for delicious food and fantastic shopping. It’s the main resort destination now, though it was once the playground of the country’s aristocracy. You’ll find a lot of expats here, as well as a large number of Maltese. There are a lot of options for boat trips around the Grand Harbour and Sliema serves as the starting point for hop on/off sightseeing buses that cover the entire island. In town, be sure to check out the Independence Garden and the De Redin tower (17th century).As you might expect from a resort town, the nightlife has a lot of energy and you’ll likely find yourself with too much that you want to do. "
St. Julians,"For those that want a little punch in the nightlife scene, St. Julians is the place.  Known for its ability to entertain, this resort town is thriving with late night fun. St. Julians includes Portomaso, Spinola Bay, St. George’s Bay, and Paceville – which is where most of the action is. For beach bums, the large flat rocks that line the coast make a perfect sunbathing bed and the seafront promenade offers a great place for a long walk.  Malta’s tallest building, Portomaso Tower, is here, as is the Love Monument and Spinola Palace (17th century). Come in August for the traditional summer festa, or come any time for unbelievable dancing, dining, and fine wine. "
Qawra,"On a peninsula between Salina Bay and St. Paul’s Bay sits Qawra (Our-ra). Thanks to the peninsula, the town has three seafronts and with so much access, it’s quickly becoming a hub for tourists seeking water sports. It’s also close to St. Julians, so if you want to experience great nightlife, but escape to a more quiet and relaxed home base, Qawra is a great option. The promenade will take you all the way to St. Paul’s and provide stunning views all along the 3k walk. Don’t miss the parish church, dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, and the Malta Classic Car Museum. "
Gozo,"Just off the coast of Malta is the small island of Gozo.  Most tourists come for the day and enjoy sites like the Temples of Ggantija, Inland Sea, The Citadel, and the Azure Window. Gozo is a mainly farming and fishing community, and most people enjoy the villages of Xlendi and Marsalforn. There’s been very little development here so an afternoon roaming the island will give you a nice feeling for a more traditional Malta.  Most arrive by ferry, but for some excitement, try the seaplane. "
Mdina,"Head inland, to the “Silent City” of Mdina to experience medieval Malta.  Built on a large hill in the centre of the country, the town has few inhabitants and no cars can enter.  Combine this with amazing views of the entire island and you’ll quickly see the magic of Mdina. It’s a good place to relax as you stroll through the narrow alleys. Though it is small, there is plenty to do.  Take in the Carmelite Church and Priory, the Natural History Museum, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Magisterial Palace, and the Palazzo Falzon. "
Birgu,"On the south side of the Grand Harbour is Birgu, one of the older cities in Malta.  Because of its location, it’s been of military significance for centuries.  The town even played an important role in the Siege of Malta. At one point, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Phoenicians, Normans, Arabs, and Aragonese all control the city and influenced its history and culture. The main entrance to the city is the love Couvre Porte and the entire place is surrounded by fortified walls. Inside you’ll find monuments and ancient history at every turn. Before leaving, explore the Inquisitor’s Palace (now a museum), The Parish Church, Notre Dame Gate, and the Malta Maritime Museum. "
Dwejra,"Dwejra is on the west coast and centuries of work by the sea have made it one of the most astounding places in Malta.  There are two underground caverns which have collapsed to form two circular depressions – current day Inland Sea and Dwerja Bay.  If you’re a Game of Thrones fan, you’ll recognize this place immediately from the shows first season. The Inland Sea is a lagoon with steep cliffs on all sides and a 100m tunnel leading to it.  Fishermen find their best catches from here and on the side they shuttle tourists back and forth through the tunnel. Dwerja and the surrounding areas are Malta’s most popular diving and snorkelling spots. "
Comino,"Home of the famous Blue Lagoon, Comino is a small island much loved by surfers, divers, and those wanting a day trip get away from their cares.  The island is car free and virtually uninhabited. It’s got white sand beaches and an intensely blue sea making everything about Comino inviting and luxurious feeling.  You can swim over to the islet of Cominotto and when you’re finished rent an umbrella and a deck chair for a nice long nap in the sun. It does get busy in the summer, so consider a winter visit to maximize your pleasure. "
Mellieha,"This is Malta’s largest beach and takes its name from the Arabic word for salt. Another popular tourist spot, Mellieha is picturesque and a favourite among the Maltese. Wonderful seaside hotels and fantastic restaurants add to the hospitality that permeates the place. In September you can take part in the Village Feast, known as “Il-Viorja,” which includes fireworks, concerts, folk singing, more great food, and many religious processions honouring Our Lady of Victories. While visiting, be sure to explore Ghadira Natural Reserve, Ghadira Bay, Armier Bay, St. Agatha’s Tower, and Popeye’s Village where the 1980 film Popeye was filmed. "
Marsaxlokk,"In southern Malta you’ll find Marsaxlokk, a fishing village known for the Sunday fish market and the many colourful Luzzus – decorated “eyed” painted boats. The history here traces back to the 9th century and was used by Phoenicians and later the Turkish fleet during The Great Siege. On the Tas-Silg hill, archaeologists have even found Bronze Age tools. Though industry is a major part of life in Marsaxlokk (the nation’s main power station is here).  The mouth-watering seafood and green water make it worth a visit. There is a lovely beach leading to the gorgeous St. Peter’s Pool and cliff diving here is an amazing experience. "
Victoria,"The capital of Goza is Victoria (or Rabat) which includes both the old city and the Citadel which sits on top of the hill.  Because of its location, The Citadel serves as the heart of the island and is sometimes called the “Crown of Gozo.” Independence Square (18th century) was once the government centre and is now home to a lively open-air market with cafes serving pastizzi and tons of fun souvenirs. The Grand Basilica is located in perhaps the oldest part of town and you’ll love walking around this area. Be sure to check out the local delicacies as you go. And don’t leave before checking out The Folklore Museum, the Old Prison, Villa Rundle, and Gozo Cathedral. "
Hagar Qim,"The best preserved and staggering of all the prehistoric sites in Malta are the standing stones known as Hagar Qim and Mnajdra. Sitting right at the top of the sea cliff, the atmosphere here is awe-inspiring.  Hagar Qim is the first temple and has been restored so that you have a better sense of what it originally looked liked.  Next to it is the 20 tonne megalith. This is the location of where the famous Venus de Malta, or “fat lady,” figurine was found.  She’s now on display at the National Museum in Valletta. Mnajdra is a series of three elaborate temples which date back to 3000 BC. There’s a great visitors centre here which will reveal all the secrets and mysteries of these ancient temples and afterwards, take a hike along the cliffs to Ghar Lapsi. "
The Hypogeum,"Discovered in 1902, The Hypogeum is a mysterious underground necropolis. The passages and chambers have been cut out of the rock and cover over 500 square metres. Since it was built, sometime between 3000 and 3600 BC, some 7000 people were buried here. This incredible structure was carved by hand.  The site was shut for a decade as the government worked to restore and protect it, using UNESCO funds, from carbon dioxide damage from tourists.  Now it is structurally safe with a controlled micro-climate.  Because the number of tourists is limited to ten per tour, pre-booking is essential. "
National Museum of Archaeology,"Located in the Auberge de Provence, in Valletta, the museum has an unbelievable range of artefacts all the way back to the Neolithic period and Phoenician period.  There is so much ancient history in Malta and here, you’ll get a great introduction and context to most of sites you’ll visit as you travel the country.  You can see the Venus of Malta, the Sleeping Lady from Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, bronze daggers from the Tarxien Temples, and the Horus and Anubis pendant from the Phoenician period. And not only will you learn about the artistry and daily lives of the first island dwellers, but the museum itself is architecturally one of the most elaborate Baroque buildings in the capital. "
Ambon City,"Ambon is one of the most developed places in Maluku and would have been a stronghold of the Dutch during the colonial period. Unfortunately much of the original Dutch architecture here was destroyed either during the war or in the late 1990s when Ambon experienced infighting and civil strife, but one site that still stands is Benteng Victoria which is a fort that dates from the 18th century. Make sure to note however that you are not allowed to take photographs of the fort unless you have a permit, but if you are looking for photographic opportunities in Ambon then you can head to the pretty mosques in Ambon in the form of Mesjid Al Fatah and Mesjid Jame. "
Seram Island,Pulau Seram has a rather alarming name as ‘seram’ means ‘scary’ in Indonesian. There is nothing to fear on a trip to Seram Island however and you can visit the main city of Masohi which is the capital city of the Central Maluku Province. Some of the main sights here include the Sangar Budaya Seram Museum which will fill you in on all the cultural and historical background of the area as well as Teluk Sawai which is a gorgeous bay in the northern part of the island. If you are looking for somewhere to stay then head to Ora Beach and peruse the traditional stilt bungalows here. 
Pulau Yamdena,The Tanimbar Islands are a mini-archipelago is some 65 different islands that sit to the south east of the main island of Maluku. The largest of the islands is Pulau Yamdena which is covered in rolling hillsides clad in pretty forests and water buffalo roam here much as they would have done for centuries. The area is also known for its pristine sands and you can visit pretty beaches like Sangliat Dol which is only accessible via a long stone staircase which stretches for 30 meters and ends in a wide stone platform that gives you amazing views over the water. This part of the Maluku’s is quite well known on the domestic tourist trail so you can expect it to get quite crowded in holiday season in Indonesia. 
Kahatola Waterfall In Ternate,"To the north of Ambon you will find the dainty Ternate Island which is the capital of the province of North Maluku. As such you can expect to find a bustling town here which used to be one of the major ports for exporting aromatic cloves, and the Dutch colonized the area in the 17th century leaving behind some interesting colonial relics. Some of these include Benteng Oranje which is a fort that dates from 1667 and still has some of the ancient cannons that would have been put in place here years ago. "
Manusela National Park,"Located on Seram Island is one of the main national parks in Maluku which is Manusela National Park. The area is known for sitting in the Wallacea Transitional Zone which is famous for its studies on the evolution of a range of indigenous species and you will find some 2,000 different kinds of butterflies here. There are also 120 different species of birds and the park sprawls over some 189,000 hectares. Some of the other highlights of the park include the two traditional villages here in the form of Wahai Village that sits at the northern entrance of the park and pretty Sanulo Village in the south. "
Halmahera,Halmahera Island is the biggest island in the Malukus and is also one of the most interesting to visit. If you like hiking then this is a top choice as you will find a range of volcanoes and primary rain forest here that includes mangrove swamps and coconut palm forests. 
Gunung Api Gamalama,"Located on Ternate Island in the main city of Ternate is Gunung Api Gamalama which is a massive volcano that is still active. The mountain towers to a height of 1,700 meters and although it still smolders from time to time you can still climb much of the way to the top. The most popular excursions in the area include clove hikes which will take you to the sides of the mountain where you can see how cloves are grown and harvested and these usually leave from the pretty village of Air Tege Tege. "
Pulau Tidore,"Tidore Island is easily accessible from neighboring Ternate and is well worth a visit as you can take a speedboat across to the main resort area which is called Soasio. As you would expect, you can find some pretty beaches here and if you venture into town you will also find a rage of historic sites such as the Benteng Tohula Fortress which was built by the Spanish in the 17th century. "
The Lava Flow Dive Site In Banda Island,"Lava Flow lies in the waters off the Banda Islands and is one of the best places to come if you want to try diving in Maluku. As the name suggests, this is the site where a huge pool of solidified lava from the eruption of Gunung Api in 1988 has congregate, and this site is also famous for its exquisite table corals. The colorful corals can grow up to four meters in size and attract a range of aquatic life such as sharks and mandarin fish. Those who like macro photography will also find a huge amount to enjoy here and you can catch the mandarin fish indulging in mating rituals in the late evening. "
Pulau Bacan,The capital city of Bacan Island is Labuha and people come here for the relaxed seaside atmosphere. The island looks out over a charming bay and you will even find a traditional Dutch and Portuguese (at different times) fortress which is called Bentang Barnevald that lies in a ruined state but is still very much worth a visit. Many people make the trip here from neighboring Ternate and you can easily hop across for the day and see everything you need to see before heading back to Ternate in the evening. Other highlights of the island include the traditional Kupal Village as well as the pebble beach at Sawadai. 
Kei Island,"Pulau Kei, also known as the Kei Islands, are one of the best places to come if you fancy long trips of white sand and azure waters. Many travelers who do make the trip to the Maluku Islands choose the Kei Islands as their base as this is a truly one of the most scenic spots in Indonesia. If you want to do some sightseeing here then make sure to come to the village of Ohoidertawun which is known for its caves and rock carvings as well as ancient cave paintings that are well worth a visit. Another highlight of a trip here is to head to Pulau Kei Kecil where you will find a massive statue of Jesus Christ which is a popular pilgrimage site here, especially around Easter. "
Bandaneira,The town of Bandaneira is located on Pulau Bandaneira which is itself part of the wider Banda Islands in Maluku. It used to be a famous trading port and as such attracted the attention of colonialists who built two large fortresses here called Benteng Belgica and Benteng Nassau which are well worth the trip for history buffs. 
Pulau Buru,Buru Island is one of the most famous in Indonesia as it used to be a penal colony in the 1960s. One of its best known inmates was the writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer who wrote a series of books called the Buru Quartet which he narrated whilst incarcerated on the island. You can now visit Buru Island and enjoy some of its other sights such as the gorgeous Jiku Merasa Beach and Waeura Waterfall. 
Pulau Lease,The Lease Islands are one of the easiest archipelagos in Maluku to visit and you will find some of the best water sports in the region here including some great snorkeling. 
Pulau Ai,The Banda Islands are a group of some ten islands which are often thought of as the main islands in the Malukus. The islands are known for their scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities and you will find gorgeous coral gardens here that are the reason why many dive enthusiasts brave the long trip out here. Some of the best diving spots around the Banda Islands include Pulau Hatta as well as Pulau Ai and Pulau Banda Besar and the beaches here are made up of long expanses of gorgeous sands that back on to turquoise waters.

"Rockport, Massachusetts","Rockport is one of the most beautifully charming towns in the state of Massachusetts. Located right at the tip of the Cape Ann peninsula, north-east of Boston, Rockport is a popular tourist spot. Many miles of soft sand beaches attract people to the town, which also has some of the best hikes in this part of the United States. Rockport&#8217;s coastal locale means it is ideal for kayaking and scuba diving, but many visitors will just want to kick back and relax in this stunning place. "
Atlantic White Cedar Swamp Trail,"Hiking down the Atlantic White Cedar Swamp Trail is an ideal leisure activity on a hot Massachusetts day. Based around the site of a former US Army base, Cape Wellfleet, the trail is home to a wide range of forest birds. At the end of the walk is the Marconi Station Site, which provides a fantastic place to look out across the Atlantic Ocean, with unforgettable views and a perfect photo opportunity. The trail is flat, making it easy for beginners, and just over a mile long. "
"Sturbridge, Massachusetts","Sturbridge is one of the most historic towns in Massachusetts and visiting it is like stepping back in time. Unique boutiques and antique shops are easy to spend hours exploring, while the living museum at Old Sturbridge Village is a must-visit too, where costumed guides give tourists a taste of life in the 19th century. Just outside Sturbridge itself is Wells State Park, which boasts a gorgeous pond where canoeing and swimming is permitted. Sturbridge is one of the best spots in Massachusetts to experience old-fashioned New England charm. "
North Point Park,"Cambridge itself is one of the most beautiful places in Massachusetts, but visitors who want to experience the best the city has to offer should head to North Point Park. Located on the Charles River, the park has only been open for a few years but has already become a very popular spot. The Zakim Bridge and the Museum of Science are among the sights that can be seen from the vantage point within the park&#8217;s grounds. A beautiful place to while away a quiet afternoon. "
Cohasset,"Cohasset might just the quintessential New England town, with its picture perfect sights drawing many tourists every year. But Cohasset is probably best known for its numerous superb beaches, many of which have been kept private to be enjoyed by local residents. Sandy Beach, known as the Jewel in the Crown in Cohasset, is open to the public &#8211; although visitors need to be accompanied by a resident. The vintage carousel and arcades at Nantasket Beach are well worth a visit too, while Cohasset&#8217;s other attractions include the white clock tower at the beautiful First Parish Meeting House. "
"Cape Cod, Massachusetts","Cape Cod is one of the romantic places in the United States, drawing countless tourists to Massachusetts every summer. Martha&#8217;s Vineyard and Nantucket are among the most picturesque locations in the world, with Cape Cod&#8217;s mix of superb cuisine, gorgeous beaches and conservation spots making it an ideal holiday location. Cape Cod Bay is ideal for those seeking peace and quiet, while Falmouth and Provincetown tend to be busier, with lively nightlife options. "
Hammond Castle,"Hammond Castle, found in Gloucester, was the home of one of the great American inventors, John Hays Hammond Jr, who was at the forefront of developing remote control technology. Today, the castle is home to a museum that displays Roman, medieval, and Renaissance artifacts collected by Hammond himself, while every October to mark Halloween the castle hosts a haunted house tour. Self-guided tours allow visitors to explore the castle themselves. "
"Berkshire, Massachusetts","A National Natural Landmark, Bartholomew&#8217;s Cobble is without a doubt one of the most beautiful places to visit in Massachusetts. The highest point of the Cobble &#8211; which was created by geological upheavals &#8211; provides amazing views across the Housatonic River Valley. There are five miles of trails to try out and the most challenging of them is up to the Hurlburt&#8217;s Hill summit. The interpretive center and museum at Bartholomew&#8217;s Cobble are also well worth checking out. "
"Townsend, Massachusetts","Townsend, Massachusetts "
Palmer Island Light Station,"Palmer Island is home to one of the most historic lighthouses in America. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Palmer Island Light Station can be found at the northern point of Palmer&#8217;s Island in New Bedford Harbor. After undergoing an extensive refurbishment project, the Palmer Island Light Station is being used once more, now as a private aid to navigation. "
Martha&#8217;s Vineyard,"Martha&#8217;s Vineyard is probably the most famous tourist location in the state and it is the jewel of the improbably gorgeous Cape Cod region. Typically referred to simply as The Vineyard, it takes a bit of an effort to reach but it is well worth the trip. The ferry to Martha&#8217;s Vineyard can be a rough ride, but the difficult journey is all part of the charm of the tiny island. Sunsets on The Vineyard are particularly beautiful, with the East Chop Lighthouse in Oak Bluffs one of the best places on the island to watch the sun go down. The beautiful small towns of Chilmark and Aquinnah are also worth visiting for anyone who wants to see Martha&#8217;s Vineyard at its most authentic and unspoiled. "
"Fall Colors At Boston Public Garden,Massachusetts","Fall is perhaps the best time of the year to explore Massachusetts as this is when the Bay State looks at its finest. The beautiful river valleys that are dotted all over the state are ideal places to watch the leaves steadily change colour and drop from the trees. The Central region of Massachusetts and the Berkshire Mountains are the best places to experience fall in Massachusetts, while Route 2, otherwise known as the Mohawk Trail, is a must-visit. "
Provincetown,"Provincetown has a tiny population in the off-season, but in the summer months as many as 60,000 people live in this gorgeous New England town. Sometimes referred to as P-town or P&#8217;town, the LGBTQ community particularly adore Provincetown because of its laid-back, accepting, relaxed feel. The Atlantic House in Provincetown is regarded as the oldest gay bar in the whole of the States, while many of Cape Cod’s best beaches are also located here, with Race Point Beach and Herring Cove Beach particularly highly recommended. "
Plimoth Plantation,"Anyone interested in history should make time to spend a day at the Plimoth Plantation living museum, which gives visitors the chance to experience what life was like in the 17th century. Among the most interesting of the attractions at the museum is a re-creation of a Wampanoag home site, where Native People explain all about how the Wampanoag&#8217;s ancestors lived. The museum is also home to the Mayflower II, which is docked near the purported Plymouth Rock. The incredible ship is among the world&#8217;s oldest wooden vessels that still sails. "
"Old State House, Boston","Boston&#8217;s Old State House is one of the oldest surviving public buildings in the United States. Dating back more than 400 years, the building &#8211; sometimes known as Boston&#8217;s Towne House &#8211; is now run as a Boston history museum by the Bostonian Society. The Old State House is among the landmarks on Boston&#8217;s Freedom Trail and visiting is a must for anyone who wants to learn more about the colonial history of the country. Most famously, The Declaration of Independence was made from the balcony of Boston&#8217;s Old State House. "
Longfellow&#8217;s Wayside Inn,"The Wayside Inn claims to be the oldest operating inn in the country, with the building featuring a mix of British colonial and Greek Revivalist architecture. The inn dates back 400 years and one of its key features is the ancient grist mill outside. The last private owner of the Wayside Inn was Henry Ford, who wanted to develop the site into a historically oriented village and museum. The inn remains open as a restaurant and guests can even stay over in historically accurate rooms. "
"Farm, Carlisle, MA","Farm, Carlisle, MA "
Chinguetti,"Chinguetti literally emerges from the shifting sand dunes of the mighty Sahara (the hills of dust that surround this one have been encroaching and encroaching for decades, and have even claimed some of the residential areas on the edge of the settlement). A place of eerily empty streets that have been chiselled and chipped by the winds, it was once an important trading stopover between the Med in the north and sub-Sahara in the south. Today, it draws some of the country&#8217;s biggest crowds, who flock to wonder at the brick-built towers and the old fortresses of the Berber tribes and Almoravids dating all the way back to the Middle Ages. The spot is also part of a larger UNESCO World Heritage Site; one that also encompasses a number of other historic desert towns in the Adrar region and beyond. "
Nouakchott,"A sprawling, dusty haze of a capital city that&#8217;s packed with tooting traffic and crumbling low-rise homes, Nouakchott is a curiously endearing place. That might be because it&#8217;s heavenly comfortable compared to the sun-baked Berber caravan settlements of the great Sahara (where most travelers are either heading or have been), but it could also be something to do with the city&#8217;s earthy vibes and unpretentious character too. Built for just 15,000 people, the greater metro area here is estimated at around over two million now! That brings a frenetic life to the shanty districts and the nomad barrios, while the Nouakchott Fish Market is unquestionably the place to be. Here, salt-washed pirogues clamber in from the Atlantic Ocean packed with fish and seafood each morning, sellers haggle, and the locals go about their daily business. "
Atar,"Atar is the gateway to the Adrar Plateau, and the place where visitors come to plan trips out to desert-shrouded medieval caravan towns like aforementioned Chinguetti. Sat close to the very heart of the country, but also close to the border with Western Sahara, the town has an earthy bazaar and sprawling crafts markets – perfect if you come in search of those traditional Mauritanian trinkets. There&#8217;s also a clutch of welcoming guesthouses and restaurants touting desert fare, which make Atar a great jumping off point for further travels to wonders like the Richat Structure or the oases of the Sahara nearby. "
Terjit,"Taking us just a short drive south on the main road out of Atar, the oasis town of Terjit remains one of the most interesting backcountry draws in all of Mauritania. It springs up from the dry-cracked desert lands on the edges of the Sahara in a medley of verdant date palms and babbling streams; a speck of tropical greenery surrounded by a sea of sand. It&#8217;s set between a series of steep-sided gorges, which rise to meet the escarpments of the Adrar Plateau in dramatic fashion. There are on-site camping spots below the palm boughs, a petting zoo with camels, and even a history of regal coronations to unravel! "
Banc d&#8217;Arguin,"Banc d&#8217;Arguin National Park is Mauritania&#8217;s only large-scale national park. And boy does it deserve the title! A vast patchwork of low sandbanks and rock-speckled beaches that drops down into the waters of the Bay of Arguin on the extreme northern fringes of Mauritania, it&#8217;s famed for its booming biodiversity, which is highlighted by the sheer amount of migratory birds that pass this way each year. Spotters can see the likes of sandpipers and flamingos, pelicans and terns in the shallows, while it&#8217;s thought that the population of nesting birds here is the highest in all of West Africa! It&#8217;s also the home of the traditional Imraguen folk, who can often be seen bobbing on pirogues between the sandy islets and the lapping waves. "
Ouadâne,"At the very end of one long and winding road that ranges from the capital at Nouakchott and deep into the heart of the Mauritanian Sahara, the dust-caked town of Ouadâne is a haunting, interesting place that does well to reveal the harsh realities of life in this arid, arid landscape. It crumbles and cracks under the scorching desert sun, with its collection of adobe stone barrios cascading down the rough escarpments and into a center of winding lanes and alleys inhabited by the occasional, lonely Berber nomad and their collection of mismatched crafts and goods. Although still officially inhabited, most of the locals here have packed up and departed for more hospitable climbs. And when the dust winds blow and the midday heat hits its zenith, it&#8217;s easy to see why! "
Tichit,"Tichit still clings to life from its far-flung position deep in the midst of the Sahara Desert. Another aspect of the country&#8217;s UNESCO Ksours, the town is a truly breathtaking affair. Look up and you&#8217;ll see the soaring tower of the Tichit Mosque, topped with crenulations and inlaid with interesting triangular window spaces (it&#8217;s perhaps the most famous mosque in the country). Then, take some time to wander the ancient city and see the curious use of coloured quarry stones – it&#8217;s unique to Tichit alone! "
Oualâta,"One part of Mauritania&#8217;s acclaimed UNESCO World Heritage Site in the desert (the ancient Ksours of the Sahara), Oualâta is unquestionably one of the most enchanting and impressive wonders in the country. Head in to wander between the age-old sandstone frontispieces, where elegant Berber and Moorish patterns are scrawled on the lintels and mantelpieces, and earthy arabesque designs mimic the elegance of Morocco&#8217;s great kasbahs in cities like Fez and Marrakech. Don&#8217;t leave without strolling the collapsed old town, or wondering up at the towers of the great Oualâta Mosque. "
Nouadhibou,"Jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean from its home on the spit of desert land known as Cabo Blanca, the town of Nouadhibou is the engine room of the Mauritanian fishing industry. Its seemingly endless docks, which fringe the frantic town along its southern edge, are home to a forest of sails and bobbing skiffs by the thousand. These head out daily to catch their Atlantic quarry, while other industries in the city include the processing of Iron ore as it comes in off the caravans from the desert mining centers. Don&#8217;t leave without gawping at the rusting colossuses of decaying liners on Nouadhibou Bay, or enjoying the sunset in seaside Cansado. "
Kiffa,"Kiffa is an interesting crossroads town set under the shadow of the dramatic Affolle Mountains, which rise in sheer walls of rock and flat-topped bluffs where the southern reaches of the Sahara crash into the lands of the African Sahel. Some come this way to head out and explore the backcountry towns in the mountains, while most come to seek out the fabled Kiffa beads that were made famous by the local crafters here. Produced using a super-secretive mixture of powdered glass, they are one of the most iconic and recognisable forms of jewellery to come out of the region. And as if that&#8217;s not enough, you can also see the impact site of a large meteorite that crashed into the mountains back in 1970 nearby! "
"Néma, Mauritania","If you&#8217;re looking for a glimpse of the old nomadic way of life that once dominated the lands of Mauritania, then perhaps the windblown settlement of Néma, all the way at the end of the so-called Road of Hope from the capital, is the place to go. Located just a short distance from the border with Mali, the place has always been a popular stopover for traders heading in and out between the Atlantic coast and the heart of West Africa. Today, it&#8217;s also known as a place that champions the old brousse: the traditional country life of Mauritania&#8217;s original people. That means you&#8217;ll get crumbling districts of mud-brick homes, dusty streets and simple, endearing folk. "
Kaédi,"The town of Kaédi exhibits a rare speck of urban greenery, for which you&#8217;ll need to travel to the extreme southern reaches of the country, where the Senegal River bends and winds around the country of Senegal itself. The architecture of the place is a curious mishmash of styles, and it&#8217;s easy to see the intermingling of the Moorish and the sub-Saharan traditions between the old low-rise cottages and that fascinating beehive-built hospital. Like so many of the country&#8217;s border towns, there&#8217;s also a great marketplace here, filled with colourful goods from the fertile south and earthy crafts from the Saharan north alike. "
Sélibaby,"Another town with its feet firmly placed in the more tropical reaches of the African Sahel, deep down on the southern fringes of the nation and close to the border with Senegal, Sélibaby is a crash of tight-knit lanes and ramshackle barrios. Thanks to its university and the all-new regional hospital facility (funded, like so many new projects in this part of Africa, by the Chinese), the place has a certain energy to it. It&#8217;s also finely placed for further travels into the southern half of Mali – which sits just to the east – and to the jungle-side towns of Senegal, which begins with the town of Bakel just across the Senegal River to the south. "
Zouérat,"Industry, industry and industry are the three things that have, above all else, governed the rise and times of the sprawling town of Zouérat. Set between the great beige and brown bluffs of the Tiris Zemmour ranges, in the northern reaches of the country, it&#8217;s long been known for its proximity to some of Africa&#8217;s richest mineral reserves. That&#8217;s the reason for the smoke and dust belching factories and refineries, and for the steady stream of convoys making their way south to the ports of the coast. Travelers would probably do better just glimpsing the industrious nature of the locals here, before heading off to see the Saharan settlements of Fderik or the likes of Chinguetti. "
Diawling National Park,"A small enclave of greenery deep on the southern edge of Mauritania, the Diawling National Park is another of the country&#8217;s birding hotspots. Packed with pelicans and northern pintails, Sudanese golden sparrows and pink-hued flamingos, it&#8217;s a great place to come and spot the curious flying creatures of West Africa. It&#8217;s also known for its sweeping acacia woods and packs of golden wolves, not to mention wealth of riparian habitats where crocs meet ducks and hippopotami along the muddy banks. "
Hindu gods at Grand Bassin,"This high mountain lake, roughly 1800 feet above sea level, is a sacred Hindu site.  You’ll find a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and the local belief is that the lake water is holy water from the Ganges River in India.  Mauritius Hindu’s make pilgrimage here during Maha Shivaratri, walking all the way from their homes.  You’ll love the 108 foot statue of Lord Shiva which was built in 2007.  It’s a beautiful lake with lovely views all around. Make the pilgrimage yourself and enjoy a nice mountain trek. "
Pointe d&#8217;Esny,"On an island full of beaches, Pointe d&#8217;Esny and Blue Bay are everyone’s top picks.  The coastline here is white sand, and there’s a well-preserved blue lagoon. It’s dotted with holiday homes and the whole stretch really comes alive in high season. Blue Bay is best known for the Marine Park where they have the best coral reef formations in Mauritius.  Snorkelling here is a must.  At the opposite end of Blue Bay is the village of Mahebourg.  Here you’ll find a quaint historical village with a lively market teeming with traditional village life.  Everyone appreciates this peek into authentic Mauritius. "
Black River Gorges National Park,"Covering over 6,000 hectares of land, the Black River Gorges National Park is the ideal place to discover native forests and wildlife.  The park has over 300 species of flowering plants, the famous and endangered pink pigeon, giant fruit bats, and much more. Located in the most spectacular part of the island, it’s difficult to overstate the importance of the conservation efforts that happen here.  Bring good hiking shoes because you’ll want to see it all and there are wonderful panoramic views of the islands many gorges, mountain peaks, and waterfalls. If you only make one day trip from the coast, be sure this is your destination. "
Mahébourg,"Mahébourg is the place to experience old Mauritius, though few venture to this ancient capital.  Built where the Dutch first landed at the end of the 16th century, here is where you’ll find rustic restaurants with beautiful terraces, a buzzing market place, beautiful beaches, and tasty but oh-so-spicy street food.  There’s a nice little museum here with exhibits detailing the British-French battle for the island, as well as the bell saved from the Le Saint-Géran , a shipwrecked vessel integral to the local legends of Mauritius.  It’s a sleepy little town but those who make it here return again and again. "
Isle aux Aigrettes,"Located in the Mahebourg Bay, the Isle aux Aigrettes, is a striking place, made entirely of coralline limestone.  You’ll notice the difference in the landscape right way – quiet different from the volcanic matter of the mainland.  Its believed by many to be the last resting place of the dodo and right now its home to the last of the dry coastal forest which was once found throughout Mauritius. These 27 hectares have been declared a natural reserve and you’ll discover some intense conservation efforts going on.  Scientists are working hard to reintroduce rare species and restore the forest to its former glory. Everyone loves to come out to Egret Island to watch the giant Aldabra tortoises and catch a sighting of the pink pigeons. "
Blue Penny Museum,"Perhaps the best museum on the island, the Blue Penny has a wide range of interesting exhibits.  Named after the world-famous Mauritian one and two penny stamps from 1847, you’ll discover the islands history here, including exploration, settlement, and the height of the colonial period.  You can also learn about the Paul and Virginie legend. The famous stamps are located on the first floor and are considered a national treasure.  To preserve their vibrant red and blue colours, they’re only lit for ten minutes every hour. History buffs will love the stories, antique maps, photographs, and Mauritius’ most famous statue. "
Grand Baie,"Considered to be the main tourism hub on the island, Grand Baie has humble roots as a small fishing village just 20 years ago.  Sometimes called Le Trop due to the incredible entertainment, you’ll find a ton of beaches, attractions, and excursions here.  Be sure to check out the Aquarium, and the interactive L’Aventure du Sucre museum. For the water lovers, try diving, waterskiing, sailing, and windsurfing.  In the evenings you’ll be surprised at the nightlife offerings and the incredible restaurants. "
Chamarel Waterfall,"At 100 metres, Chamarel is the highest waterfall in Mauritius.  Remember to bring your cameras because there are some amazing shots to be had here.  This impressive sight has stairs leading to a viewing platform at the top where you can watch the water crashing below.  In addition to your camera, bring a swim suit if you’d like to take a dip in the shallow waters at the bottom of the falls. The waterfall is located in Black Gorges National park and is often combined with a trip to the Seven Coloured Earth – made up of red, brown, and purple shaded sand dunes created by volcanic rocks which cooled at different temperatures. "
Le Souffleur,"This is a destination for the risk takers.  Le Souffleur is a half-formed grotto sitting on a steep cliff side.  There’s a geyser like fountain which can reach up to 20 metres high when the sea is rough.  To reach it you have to take a 4WD and get permission from the Savannah sugar estate near L’Escalier;  but it’s so worth it.  If you come at the right time, there’s a natural bridge nearby formed from the collapsed roof of a nearby grotto. "
Maison Eureka,"Maison Eureka is a well-preserved French colonial mansion situated high up in the centre of the island, closed to Moka.  Once owned by the islands largest sugar baron, this home is an unbelievable engineering masterpiece.  A complete wrap around balcony, 109 doors, and turreted rooftop windows are just the beginning. You can take a nice trek from the garden filled with bamboo and ebony and follow along until you reach a lovely little swimming hole beneath a waterfall. Be sure to stop and admire the views of the Moka mountain range and stop for tea in the tea room. "
Casela Nature &amp; Leisure Park,"This is your spot to enjoy an African safari on the island.  Here you’ll find lions, ostrich, zebra, giraffe, hippopotamus, and elephant, all seen from inside a safari mini-bus.  You can also rent a segway or a quad bike and have a bit of fun scattering the large herds of deer as you zip around.  Also, the longest zip line in the Indian Ocean is found here.  It’s so easy to enjoy an entire day in the park, especially with the parks great restaurant with striking views of the west coast.  Nature lovers will appreciate the more than 1500 birds, exotic flowers and planets, and the overall diversity of the park. "
Tamarin Beach,"Once known as Santosha Beach, Tamerin once offered some of the best surfing in the world. Locals called it Santosha so that no one could find it and develop it!  It’s a little past its prime and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped back a few decades when you arrive, but honestly, this is part of the charm.  You won’t find the oversized and high walled resorts here.  But you will find arguably the best scenic backdrop in Mauritius. "
François Leguat Reserve,"This wonderful reserve re-creates the Eden discovered by the island first explorer.  At the end of the 17th century, François Leguat wrote that, walking on tortoise shell, he could take 100 steps around Rodrigues without ever stepping on the ground.  There are over 100,000 indigenous trees and thanks to a breeding program, hundreds of tortoises that roam the reserve.  You can also explore nearby caves while a local guide shares stories of the geological history of Mauritius.  Don’t forget to stop by the museum to learn the settlement history as well as the story oof the  Solitaire, the extinct cousin of the Dodo. "
Domaine de L&#8217;Étoile,"This is an old sugar estate now turned into an eco-playground. Domaine de L&#8217;Étoile has horseback riding, quad biking, archery, and buggy trips, all on the slopes of the Bambous Mountain range.  There are several self-guided treks – all which include an authentic Mauritian buffet lunch that is not to be missed.  There’s a zip line circuit here which takes two hours to complete and is, arguably the most fun you’ll have all day.  There’s a kids village, lovely ebony and cinnamon tree forests, and some left over movie sets from the 1972 movie Paul and Virginie, based on the popular island legend.  Those who are really lucky will spot a Javanese stag or two hiding in the forest. "
Liverpool,"The city centre has been intensively revitalised in the last decade, as you&#8217;ll see at Liverpool One, a snazzy district of shops, hotels and dining. Just around the corner on Matthew Street is the fabled Cavern Club, where the Beatles first built their buzz and performed 300 times, far more than at any other venue in the UK. The enormous St. George&#8217;s Hall is spectacular inside and out, and you have to make time for the monolithic Liverpool Cathedral, built in the early-1900s, and the Walker Art Gallery, which is as good as any art museum outside London (think Degas, Rembrandt, Hockney and Freud). And it wouldn&#8217;t be fair not to mention Anfield Stadium, the ground of England&#8217;s most successful football club in an unprepossessing stadium. "
Liverpool Waterfront,"The Mersey obviously contributes a lot to Liverpool&#8217;s identity, and a large proportion of the city&#8217;s top attractions are on the UNESCO-listed riverside. For starters you catch that famous ferry across the Mersey from Pier Head to Woodside in Birkenhead and get a better view of Liverpool&#8217;s singular skyline. There are museums aplenty in here: The Beatles Story, Tate Liverpool, the Merseyside Maritime Museum and the International Slavery Museum are in solemn warehouses on Albert&#8217;s Dock, while the Museum of Liverpool has a more futuristic aspect. And you can&#8217;t miss the iconic Liver Building, a symbol for the city along with the Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building. "
"Ainsdale Beach, Southport","There aren&#8217;t many English seaside resorts in such rude health as Southport, which has all the signature amenities of a Victorian escape. There&#8217;s an amusement arcade, pleasure park and the spacious Ainsdale beach, all accompanied by local shops. The second-longest pleasure pier in the British Isles is in Southport, at more than a kilometre in length and with a modern glass pavilion at the end. Lord Street, the leafy main shopping artery, is especially lovely with glazed shop canopies and the plush Wayfarers Arcade. Napoleon III spend the last couple of years of his exile here in the 1840s before returning to rule France&#8217;s Second Empire. "
"Crosby, England","The muddy beach at Crosby is to be admired from the grassy foreshore rather than in the water, as bathing is prohibited because of the fluctuating tides. But you have a strong motive to sit and contemplate the scene as it currently hosts Anthony&#8217;s Gormley&#8217;s Another Place art installation. There are 100 cast iron life-sized figures spread at wide intervals, each weighing 650 kg. At sunset they imbue the beach with real drama, but won&#8217;t be here forever so you need to come to see them sharpish. There&#8217;s also loads of Georgian and Victorian architecture about the town, and for some Titanic trivia, the captain Edward Smith lived at a house on Marine Terrace. "
Birkenhead,"You won&#8217;t be catching the ferry across the Mersey just for the view of Liverpool, as there are some attractions to keep you in Birkenhead for longer than you might expect. The Lady Lever Art Gallery is one of Merseyside&#8217;s top museum with lots of Victorian art, especially by the pre-Raphaelites and a hoard of Wedgwood fine china, as well as vases and sculpture from Ancient Greece and Rome. The 12th-century Birkenhead Priory is the oldest building still standing on Merseyside, and at the Wirral Transport there are vintage buses and trams gathered from around Merseyside, and you can also ride the heritage tramway that stops outside this former tram shed. "
Port Sunlight,"An outstanding piece of 19th century urban planning, Port Sunlight is a model village built on what had been empty marsh land south of the Mersey. The 800 houses in this estate were for workers at a factory owned by the Lever Brothers, and the name &#8220;Sunlight&#8221; comes from the brand of soap that was manufactured there. Some 30 architects worked together on the project, and Port Sunlight conveys the more humane attitude towards workers at the turn of the century, providing a pastoral atmosphere, abundant green space, places of worship and leisure facilities. At the village&#8217;s museum you&#8217;ll meet William Hesketh Lever, who conceived the village and see some of the innovative plans that were never realised. "
Formby Dunes,"In a metropolitan county like Merseyside unencumbered nature can be hard to find. But Formby bucks the trend with epic sandy beaches on the edge of sand dunes banking up like a miniature mountain range. All this is just minutes from the centre of Liverpool, so joggers, cyclists and dog-walkers all make the trip for the sea air and wide open scenery. It&#8217;s no mystery why Formby has been chosen by Liverpool&#8217;s high-earning professionals, and many Liverpool and Everton footballers live in the vicinity. If you can handle a golf club you&#8217;ve got a choice of coastal links courses like Royal Birkdale, Hillside, West Lancashire and Formby Golf Club in this area. "
West Kirby,"The endless sandflats along the Irish sea coast can make bathing tricky, but at West Kirby there&#8217;s a man-made marine lake replenished by the sea. The panoramas here are pretty special, as water surrounds you in three directions at the western corner of the <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-wirral/"">Wirral Peninsula</a>. If things heat up in summer, come here for some bathing, while the consistent breezes bring windsurfers and sailors further away from the shore. On dry land, West Kirby is a high-earning kind of place, with lots of parkland, the Royal Liverpool Golf Club and streets around the centre with restaurants, independent shops like butchers, delicatessens and florists. "
New Brighton Lighthouse,"Up from Birkenhead on the norhteastern corner of the Wirral Peninsula is a seaside resort that came to prominence in the 1800s but suffered in the 20th-century. There was once a massive iron tower here, larger than the one in Blackpool, but dismantled in the wake of the First World War. What does remain though is plenty of charming Victorian housing, Fort Perch Rock a coastal battery from 1825 and the majestic New Brighton Lighthouse from 1825. And then there the timeless sandy beaches on the Irish Sea, just what you need on sunny July and August afternoons and matched with crazy golf, kids&#8217; play areas and the much-loved Floral Pavilion Theatre. "
"Canning, Liverpool","Known as the Georgian Quarter, Canning is a  small area just east of the cathedral that was residence for the city&#8217;s wealthy industrialists in the 18th and 19th centuries. There are broad streets of beautiful flat-fronted houses, some five storeys tall and other charming cottages with rose gardens out front. It seem strange to see Canning now, but these glorious houses were run down in the 70s and 80s before finding a new lease of life as Liverpool&#8217;s fortunes improved. In the fenced gardens at Falkner Square you&#8217;ll be wondering if you&#8217;ve accidentally ended up in Bath or Cheltenham. "
"St Helens, England","A working town with industrial roots, St Helens had a wide variety of industries in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as cotton weaving, coal mining, glassmaking and copper-smelting, on top of a number of other mining operations for minerals and limestone. You&#8217;ll encounter the legacy of this period at attractions like the World of Glass, a historic kiln with exhibitions of vintage local glassware and the possibility for you to try your hand at glass-blowing. In the north the &#8220;League&#8221; code of Rugby is king, and St Helens has one of England&#8217;s top sides. St Helens RFC have won the Rugby League Championship 13 times and play their home matches at Langtree Park Stadium in the spring and summer months. "
Thurstaton,"Just down from West Kirby, Thurstaton is another place on the Wirral Peninsula that feels like open countryside. The Wirral Country Park is a mix of the sandy coast with beaches you can bathe on, and mature woodland and heathland woven with trails bounded by the 20-metre boulder clay cliffs. At the Dee Cliffs you&#8217;ll see the most beautiful sunsets and can gaze out over the Dee River to the Clwydian Range in northeast Wales. You could treat your little ones to a trip to the Church Farm Park, which has turned farmyard sights and activities into a mini-theme park. There are tractor rides along with enclosures for hens, goats, alpacas, cows and sheep. "
"St Peter&#8217;s Church, Woolton","If you&#8217;re a committed Beatles fan you can pick up the trail in this upmarket southeastern suburb. To people not in the know, many of the sights around Woolton will be pretty nondescript, but for fans they will be shrines of pop history where history was made. So, you have St. Peter&#8217;s Church, where Eleanor Rigby is buried, and where John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met in the church hall in 1957. There&#8217;s Strawberry Field a former estate belonging to the Salvation Army, where John Lennon would come for an annual garden party in summer. And lastly there&#8217;s John Lennon&#8217;s childhood home, at 251 Menlove Avenue (Mendips), bought by Yoko Ono and then donated to the National Trust . It was restored to its appearance in the 1950s in 2003. "
Calderstones Park,"And if you&#8217;ve come this far you&#8217;d be remiss not to see the childhood homes of the remaining two founding Beatles members. Allerton neighbours Woolton to the south and is also a cosy, middle-class kind of place. Calderstones Park is a gentle green space with a botanic garden, all next to the Calderstones House, a handsome neoclassical mansion from the Regency Era. And as for the Beatles trail, Paul McCartney&#8217;s childhood home is at 20 Forthlin Road. Then a little closer to the city centre in Wavertree is the house in which George Harrison was born in 1943 and lived until 1950, at 12 Arnold Grove. "
Knowsley Hall,"Just a small outer suburb to the east of Liverpool, Prescot is bordered by the grounds of Knowsley Hall. This is an 18th-century stately home passed down by the Earls of Derby, although there had been a hunting lodge on these lands since medieval times. Knowsley Hall is now rented out for functions, while the ten square kilometres of grounds host Merseyside&#8217;s favourite animal attraction. Knowsley Safari Park has its roots in the Earl of Derby&#8217;s menagerie, and has rhinos, elephants, tapirs and baboons in smaller enclosures, and then everything from Siberian tigers to African wild dogs in semi-captivity in seven different zones at the Safari Drive. "
Mexico City,"A sprawling, seething mass of more than eight million people, Mexico City is the beating urban heart of Central America. It bursts forth from the Valley of Mexico right in the middle of the country; a patchwork of barrios and shanty towns, gilded historic centers and – more recently – shiny blocks of business high-rises. In the midst of the Centro Historico, the great Zocalo (the third largest city square in the world) spreads out close to sights like the Templo Mayor (raised atop ancient Aztec ruins) and the sun-splashed stones of Madero Street. Archaeological museums abound, while Chapultepec is green and leafy, and Condesa comes complete with more international eateries and stylish cocktail bars than you can shake a Mexico City burrito at! "
"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","Seen by many as the veritable jewel of the Pacific Coast, Puerto Vallarta sits nestled beautifully between Mexico’s Sierras Cuale, the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental and the shimmering rollers of the ocean. For decades it’s drawn jet setters and sunbathers and fashionistas to its shores, and these folk can still be seen flitting between the beaches of Banderas Bay, the golfing resorts of the Mayan Palace and the wealth of fine-art galleries that pepper the old town heart of El Centro. However, Puerto Vallarta has taken on a more adventurous edge in recent decades, offering trekkers and horse riders routes through the wild Sierra Madre, surfers some of the top left-to-righters in the country, and whale watchers plenty of humpbacks out at sea. "
Cancun,"The sleepless party capital of Mexico makes its home on the sun-splashed coast of the Yucatan, where the tropical jungles of Mesoamerica give way to the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea. The city is one of two halves, spread out between the historic, Spanish-infused old center and the bustling super-resorts of the so-called Hotel Zone. Of course, the beaches are top-notch, running north to south from popular Pearl Beach and Isla Mujeres to the lively bar-backed Blue Seagull Beach. After a long day of sunning yourself, Cancun’s clutch of hedonistic cocktail joints and clubs takes over; the likes of Senor Frog’s and Basic Discotheque offering Spring Break-style blow outs the likes of which you’ve never seen! "
San Miguel de Allende,"A popular out-of-town weekend spot for day-trippers coming from Mexico City and one of the country’s most eye-wateringly wonderful colonial centers for sure, San Miguel de Allende rises in a patchwork of pristine Spanish-style churches and sun-splashed piazzas redolent of Andalusia from its place in the midst of Guanajuato. A little ironically, this European-infused city was actually one of the powerhouses of the Mexican revolution back in the 19th century, giving the nation the revered national hero of Ignacio Allende (now its namesake). Be sure to case out the beautiful Plaza de Armas and its manicured laurel bushes, before wandering between the tight-knit cobbled streets and spying out the pink-hued El Jardin and San Miguel’s many international eateries and galleries. "
Chichen Itza,"Chichen Itza is a bucket list topper for sure. Raised from the 7th century onwards, this crumbling cluster of ruins and colossal megalith structures was once one of the nerve centres of the great Mayan civilisation. Visitors come by their thousands to spy out the soaring pyramid temples and UNESCO-attested ruins, flitting in guide groups between the likes of the Temple of the Warriors and the eerily titled Platform of the Skulls, the observatory tower of El Caracol and the haunting Cenote of Sacrifice. The piece de resistance though? Well, that only comes twice a year, when the serpentine stairs of the soaring Pyramid of Kukulca reflect the low rays of the sun and cast mysterious shadows over the Mayan rockwork. "
"Valladolid, Mexico","Surrounded by the totemic ancient and pre-Columbian sites of the Yucatan Peninsula, Valladolid is a charming colonial city that oozes Spanish charm from every one of its ochre-hued, neo-classical facades. Nestled just a short drive from both Chichen Itza and party-mad Cancun, the spot is gilded with the gorgeous Catedral de San Gervasio and the Mayan relics of the Museo de San Roque. But the rich history of this aged and fading conquistador’s city aside, travelers who do linger here will also discover a laid-back café culture booming from between the tree-lined boulevards and streets, while the sparkling waters of Cenote Dzitnup beckon on the edge of town. "
"Tulum, Mexico","Perched high above the glimmering waters of the Caribbean Sea just a little jaunt down the coast from lively Cancun, the ruins at Tulum continue to vie with Chichen Itza for the place of Mexico’s most famed Mayan site. Tulum certainly wins on the looks front – that’s for sure. Its lichen-spotted temple tops come encircled by groves of swaying palm trees, ringed by powdered sands, while the Pyramid El Castillo is a wonder to behold and the remaining rocks of the God of Winds temple stand firm above the ocean. Tulum is also beloved of beach bums and kite surfers, cenote seekers (check out the awesome El Gran Cenote) and luxury lovers (there are oodles of top-notch hotels on the shores). "
Santiago de Queretaro,"Santiago de Queretaro is considered one of Mexico’s safest and prettiest towns. Since 1996 it’s been tagged with that much coveted UNESCO World Heritage epithet. And boy is it deserved! Bougainvillea blooms spill out from the low-rise pueblo cottages in the historic center, casting shadows across the Spanish cobbles. Then there’s the former home of the Spanish viceroyalty of the city, and the legendary Theater of the Republic &#8211; the very spot where Mexico’s onetime foreign ruler – Maximiliano &#8211; was found guilty at the hands of Benito Juarez. Steeped in history and charming to the hilt, Queretaro’s a real must on any Mexican trip! "
Oaxaca City,"Enfolded by the rising foothills of the Sierra Madre in the deep south-western reaches of Mexico, Oaxaca City is kissed by mountain breezes and adorned with glorious traces of colonialism to boot. At its very heart, the UNESCO-tagged Zocalo square gives way to a curious medley of the Gothic, Baroque and Art Nouveau. From here, visitors can opt to hit the stretches of the pedestrianised Andador Macedonio Alcala and spy out contemporary MACO and the Casa de Benito Juarez to name just a few of the artsy and historical musts. On the fringes of the city stand the World Heritage ruins of Monte Alban too; an enthralling look into the lives and traditions of the mysterious pre-Columbian Zapotec peoples. "
"Cozumel, Mexico","A fragment of Caribbean paradise set just off the much-trodden shorelines of the Yucatan Peninsula, Cozumel reigns as one of Mexico’s supreme tropical destinations. It comes with countless beaches and stretches of pearly-white, powdery sands, along with its own share of pre-Columbian ruins at the dusty excavations of San Gervasio and the El Caracol lighthouse. Family-friendly San Miguel is a great place to sample the fiery tacos and bean stews of the Mexican Caribbean too, and the city is replete with oodles of tour providers offering one of Cozumel’s top activities: diving. This takes place all around the rugged coves of the coast, delving into the coral gardens and marine parks and seeking out turtle nests and eagle rays along the way! "
"Guadalajara, Mexico","The great unending capital of Jalisco is a cocktail (no pun intended) of all things Mexican, from tongue-tingling margaritas (this is the home of tequila after all!) to the rhythms of mariachi. It’s also the country’s second biggest metropolis, and has routes going all the way back to the times when Spanish conquistadores roamed Mesoamerica. Travelers should be sure to see the gorgeous and much-rebuilt façade of the Guadalajara Cathedral, and the enchanting, sombrero-spotted square of Plaza de los Mariachis. Meanwhile, the district (actually a separate city altogether) of Zapopan offers lively cantinas and bars, and Tlaquepaque has the flavour of an old Mexican pueblo. "
Zihua Beach,"Made famous by the dreams of one Andy Dufresne in the classic prison escape film The Shawshank Redemption, you could be forgiven for thinking that the paradisiacal beach-side strips of Zihuatanejo are inhabited mainly by ex-cons and fugitives from north of the border. They aren’t though, and instead this beautiful seaside spot is home to makeshift cabanas that spill onto the sands in a medley of margaritas and sun umbrellas, the bobbing boats of local fishermen and the sparkling waters of the Pacific, forever lapping against the rocks and tideline. Just to the northwest is where travelers will find the real tourist boom – if that’s your sort of thing – between the condos and golf courses of Ixtapa. "
Cabo San Lucas,"Set between the chiselled cliffs and rugged bulwarks of rock that define the very tip of the Baja California peninsula, the famed resort town of Cabo San Lucas is a place that continues to defy expectations. Yes, it’s packed with Spring Breakers out of the US, and comes with the legendary bars of Senor Frog’s and Cabo Wabo (owned by none other than Sammy Hagar of Van Halen fame), but there’s also a refined edge to the town. For example, the Shoppes At Palmilla strip offers swish boutiques and art galleries, while there are more five-star hotels peppering the clifftops of the Baja than you can shake a platter of Tex-Mex at. Put simply, this one’s a great, all-rounder on the Mexican line-up of beachside resorts. "
"Chihuahua, Mexico","Not the most historically rich of towns, nor the most energetic, Chihuahua fuses heritage and authentic northern charm between its smatterings of preserved colonial relics. It’s also famed as the onetime burial spot of the revered holy man come revolutionary Miguel Hidalgo. Visitors who opt to stop off here, between the cacti-spotted deserts just south of the US border, can enjoy the lively El Palomar Central Park, where festivals erupt ad hoc throughout the year, and a series of beautifully preserved Spanish-style mansions. Beware: Chihuahua’s unique culinary output is not for the faint hearted – we’re talking about the chiles rellenos, which packs one serious capsicum punch! "
Sunrise at Acapulco Bay,"Perhaps the most famous balneario (beachside resort town) in all of Mexico and now a name synonymous with Pacific relaxation and recreation, Acapulco once led the way for partying and hedonism in these parts. Its palm-fringed sands and boulder-strewn coves were first discovered in the 1940s and fast became a magnet for gringos and celebs, who came in their droves to raise condos and villas along the sun-splashed shore. However, a tumultuous gang war has since diminished the easy-going rep and Acapulco now takes a backseat, in favour of spots like Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. Those who do come can expect beautiful promenades bustling with cantinas, pristine beaches and some seriously dramatic cliff diving from the heights of La Quebrada. "

"Split Rock Lighthouse, Minnesota","Split Rock Lighthouse is often described as one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States &#8211; and it is easy to see why. Just over 100 years old, the building, found south-west of Silver Bay, is a National Historic Landmark. After being retired in 1969, the lighthouse became the focal point for the Split Rock Lighthouse State Park. It has featured on stamps and in the 2013 adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Guided tours of the lighthouse are also available. "
Lake Itasca,"Lake Itasca may be small, but as it is the headwaters of the Mississippi River, it is one of the most important natural locations in the state of Minnesota. The lake can be found in Clearwater County and it houses the University of Minnesota&#8217;s Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories campus. The lake is popular with boaters and is stocked with game fish. Visitors to Lake Itasca will also find plenty to see and do across Itasca State Park, which is the oldest park in Minnesota. "
"Minnehaha Falls In Minneapolis, Minnesota","Minnehaha Falls is one of the most accessible waterfalls in Minnesota, as it can be found within the grounds of Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis. The falls can be found close to Minnehaha Creek near the confluence of the creek with the Mississippi River, near Fort Snelling. Almost a million people visit the waterfall every year, while it is also one of the most photographed places in the state. The falls are just over 50 feet in height are the subject of Longfellow&#8217;s &#8220;Song of Hiawatha&#8221;. "
Minneapolis,"The biggest city in the state, Minneapolis is a must for anyone visiting Minnesota for the first time. Theater is particularly popular in Minneapolis, which has a huge range of shows to enjoy. Indeed, Minneapolis has a strong cultural history, with Prince, Hüsker Dü and The Replacements all hailing from the city. Visitors should check out the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis Sculpture Garden and the Basilica of St. Mary during their time in the city, while the Minneapolis Skyway System is extremely useful to get around the city in poor weather conditions. Minneapolis-Saint Paul was also declared the Best Local Food Scene by USA Today in 2015. "
Minnehaha Falls Regional Park,"Minnehaha Falls Regional Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is one of the most beautiful sites in Minnesota. Home to Minnehaha Falls, the park also houses the John H. Stevens House and the Princess Depot. One of the most popular things to do at the park is to walk along the Minnehaha Creek and follow it to the Mississippi River. Minnehaha Falls Regional Park is also famous for being one of the first state parks in the United States. "
"St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, Minnesota","The Cathedral of Saint Paul, National Shrine of the Apostle Paul, commonly known as St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, is one of the most beautiful buildings in the whole state. The distinctive copper dome of the cathedral makes it one of the most recognizable cathedrals in the United States. The building, which is one of the best examples of Beaux-Arts architecture, is comparable to the great cathedrals of Europe. The cathedral, which is typically open seven days a week. is listed as a landmark on the National Register of Historic Buildings. "
"Como Park Conservatory, St Paul, Minnesota","Como Park Zoo &amp; Conservatory is one of the most popular tourist attractions in St. Paul, attracting close to two million people every year. The free park, which is found at Lake Como, features a zoo, a conservatory and an amusement park, as well as a golf course and a pool. The Marjorie McNeely Conservatory features a Japanese Garden, while the main attractions of the zoo are its twin Polar bear brothers. Como Park Zoo &amp; Conservatory is a perfect family day out. "
"Stone Arch Bridge, Minneapolis","The Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis is unique as it is the only bridge of its kind to cross the Mississippi River. Made of native granite and limestone, there are 23 arches spanning the river, making the bridge a superb photo opportunity. Recognized as a National Civil Engineering Landmark, the nearby Father Hennepin Bluff Park is perhaps the best place from which to view the bridge. The bridge itself is also considered to be one of the best ways to enjoy the view of the exceptionally beautiful St. Anthony Falls. "
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness,"The most visited wilderness in the United States, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Minnesota. Fishing and canoeing are both extremely popular on the many lakes of the wilderness, which has a dozen hiking trails and more than 2,000 designated campsites. Black bears, bobcats, deer, wolves and Canada lynx all live in the park, which is over a million acres in size. Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness &#8211; or BWCAW for short &#8211; certainly provides the ultimate wilderness experience in Minnesota. "
Gooseberry Falls State Park,"Gooseberry Falls State Park, found on the North Shore of Lake Superior, is a gorgeous place to visit during a trip to Minnesota. The park is worth exploring at any time of the year, as it has an excellent cross-country ski trail system for winter, beautiful colors during fall and loads of hiking trails for the summer. But it is perhaps spring when Gooseberry Falls State Park is at its most picturesque, as this is when its waterfalls are at their fullest and most powerful. The park is close to Duluth and within easy reach of Highway 61. "
"Mississippi River, Minnesota","The Mississippi River is arguably America&#8217;s greatest natural sight, and the river is perhaps at its most stunning within the state of Minnesota. As the river flows through Minnesota it makes its way through woodlands, valleys and prairies, with certain sections having been designated as a Wild and Scenic river. Indeed, the Mississippi River and the Great River Road start their journey in northern Minnesota, with the source at Lake Itasca a popular tourist attraction in its own right. St. Paul&#8217;s Mississippi River Visitor Center is a great place to go to learn more about the river&#8217;s history. "
Gooseberry Falls State Park,"The falls at Gooseberry Falls State Park are among the most beautiful of any in the state, if not in the whole United States. The Upper, Middle and Lower Falls of the Gooseberry River all plunge through a spectacular gorge to provide a stunning sight that has to be seen to be believed. Civilian Conservation Corps log and stone structures make the park look and feel particularly special, while there are five waterfalls in all to enjoy within the grounds of Gooseberry Falls State Park. "
"Lake Superior, Minnesota","Lake Superior is gigantic. In fact, the lake is so big that it could contain all the other Great Lakes, as well as three more lakes the size of Lake Erie. To say Lake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes does not come close to describing its majesty &#8211; it demands to be experienced. Tourists and adventurers alike flock to Lake Superior to see it for themselves. The 256-mile Superior Hiking Trail is particularly popular, while others bike the Gitchi Gami paved trail. Fishing at Lake Superior is huge, with lake trout and a variety of salmon, as well as northern pike, perch and brook trout. "
"Itasca State Park, Minnesota","The oldest state park in Minnesota, Itasca State Park is without a doubt one of the best in the state too. The historic Douglas Lodge or cabins offer the chance to sleep under the stars, with the 2,000-acre Wilderness Sanctuary, which is one of Minnesota&#8217;s seven National Natural Landmarks, one of the many must-see attractions within the grounds of the park. Itasca State Park offers people the chance to walk across the Mississippi River at the start of its vast winding journey through America &#8211; truly a unique, unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience. "
Temperance River State Park,"Temperance River State Park offers simply amazing views and it is no wonder many locals return every single year. The Temperance River itself drains into Lake Superior, flowing out of Brule Lake in Cook County. The Temperance River, located within the Superior National Forest, is certainly one of the most beautiful places to visit during a trip to Minnesota. Temperance River State Park offers a pair of camping grounds, with one situated on each side of the river. The Gooseberry River "
Gooseberry River,"The Gooseberry River is known as the gateway to Lake Superior&#8217;s North Shore, but it is a destination well worth visiting in its own right. Famous mainly for its three spectacular waterfalls, the river is now now a thriving tourist destination. The river is at its heaviest flow during the spring due to melting snow, while it has been known to run almost dry during the height of the summer. Brook, brown, and rainbow trout are among the many fish that can be found in the river. "
Minnesota 210,"Minnesota 210 is probably the main way people will experience what the state has to offer. The highway, which runs from west-central to north-east, takes in places such as Duluth, Fergus Falls and Brainerd. Minnesota State Highway 210 runs extremely close to Glendalough State Park, which describes itself as providing a true respite from civilization. Glendalough State Park&#8217;s highlight is arguably crystal clear Annie Battle Lake, which is well worth a stop-off when travelling along Minnesota State Highway 210. "
"Silver Bay, Minnesota","Silver Bay is one of the most scenic spots in the state of Minnesota, with its Shovel Point offering truly breathtaking views. North Shore Scenic Cruises are among the most popular things to do during a trip to the city, while snowshoeing in George Crosby Manitou State Park should also be on the list of experiences to sample during a visit. Baptism River might just be the most beautiful place in Silver Bay, although it faces competition from hiking on the stunning Tettegouche Trail. "
"Duluth, Minnesota","Duluth, the second-largest city on Lake Superior&#8217;s shores, is well worth a visit for anyone going to Minnesota for the first time. The seaport city is the home to America&#8217;s only all-freshwater aquarium, while the world&#8217;s longest freshwater baymouth bar can also be found in Duluth. The Aerial Lift Bridge is a surprisingly compelling sight when visiting Duluth, while the city is a great starting point for Minnesota&#8217;s North Shore Scenic Drive. The city itself also hosts popular attractions such as the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center and Glensheen, The Historic Congdon Estate, as well as the Leif Erickson Park &amp; Rose Garden. "
"Windsor Ruins National Historic Site, Mississippi","The Windsor Ruins are well and truly off the beaten track, giving visitors a private window into the centuries gone by quite unlike other tourist attractions. Surrounded by natural beauty and a breath-taking scenery, it’s easy to forget the Windsor Ruin’s past of slavery, war, and disaster. Built between 1859 and 1861 by a wealthy plantation owner, Smith Coffee Daniel II, was a four-story Greek Revival mansion overlooking the Mississippi River. Destroyed by a fire on 1890, all that remains of the grand mansion are the beautiful Greek columns and a deathly serenity—a haunting reminder of what once was. "
Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge,"The Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge is home to not only a wide variety of Mississippi’s native wildlife but some stunning natural beauty, too. As a feeding area for migratory species, the boardwalk at Doyle Arm offers some spectacular bird watching year-round—and for the more adventurous explorer, the opportunity to see Alligators in their natural habitat is something not to be missed. Doyle Arm has something for everyone, offering breathtaking scenery, a host of animal-spotting opportunities, and room for quiet contemplation. The best time to visit is the fall when the leaves have begun to change and the water glistens an orange-brown hue. "
Cypress Swamp On The Natchez Trace In Mississippi,"While away a few hours in the tranquility of Cypress Swamp, inside the Natchez Trace Parkway National Park. Bask in the natural beauty that you’d be hard-pressed to find elsewhere and take in the excitement of seeing Mississippi’s wildlife at play. Whether walking, driving, or cycling, you’ll find lots to do and see when you visit the Cypress Swamp and its surrounding area. "
"Dunn&#8217;s Mill And Falls, Mississippi","Dunn’s Falls, named after their creator—John Dunn, an Irish immigrant—came to be in the mid-1850s. Hidden among the rugged landscape around the Chunky River, the stream provides a natural source of power via a working water wheel, before crashing seventy feet into the river below. Whether you are looking to take part in activities such as fishing, canoeing, and swimming, or simply wish to see the marvel of nineteenth-century engineering, this quiet landmark offers something for everyone. "
Friendship Cemetery,"Formerly known as Odd Fellows Cemetery, the Friendship Cemetery fills visitors with conflicted emotions. While appreciating the natural beauty of this historic resting place, it’d be easy to forget that thousands of unknown soldiers, federal and confederate, are buried here—were it not for the graves that stretch as far as the eye can see. However, many graves have been reclaimed by Mother Nature herself, with Southern Magnolias decorating otherwise grim reminders of the bloody civil war that raged on in the surrounding areas in the not too distant past; Friendship Cemetery is a real testament to the continuous beauty of the natural world. "
Stanton Hall In Natchez,"Irish immigrant and successful cotton merchant, Frederick Stanton, began the construction of his dream home in 1857. The house covered the area of a city block and was decorated with the finest marble from New York and grand mirrors imported from France. Stanton Hall has seen a vast and varied history: with its namesake dying only months after it was completed, the hall housed Union troops throughout the Civil War. In 1894, Stanton Hall was transformed into a Ladies College and remained that way until 1938, when it was bought and restored to its former glory by the Pilgrimage Garden Club. Nowadays, daily 30-minute tours of the home are given, providing a unique insight into the history of this beautiful mansion. Whether you love architecture or history, Stanton Hall provides an excellent day out—and food lovers will delight in the nearby Carriage House Restaurant! "
"Biloxi, Mississippi","You’d be forgiven for thinking that New Orleans was the birthplace of Mardi Gras. However, that honor actually resides with Biloxi! Known as the “playground of the south,” Biloxi has a host of activities, landmarks, and cultures to suit all tastes. Thanks to its prime position on the Mississippi Gulf, wherever you are in Biloxi, you’re always near to beautiful coastline and pristine beaches. With casinos and nightclubs for party-goers, mini-golf and amusement parks for children, and everything in between, it’s no wonder that Biloxi is such a popular seaside getaway! "
Mississippi State Capitol,"The third State Capitol building to be built in Jackson, Mississippi, this signature landmark was completed in 1903 and cost over one million dollars to build! After undergoing a renovation between 1979 and 1983, the Capitol building still retains its original architectural design and feel, as was the intention throughout the restoration project. Listed on the National Register of Historical Places and located at 400 High Street, Jackson, the Mississippi State Capitol building is well worth a visit thanks to its beautiful Beaux Arts flair. It is hard to decide what is more impressive, the exterior façade, with its 180-foot dome; or the brightly lit interior with its replica liberty bell, and multitudes of scenes from US history. With free-of-charge daily tours on a daily basis, and group reservations available upon request, the Mississippi State Capitol is not to be missed! "
"Fillmore Street Chapel, Corinth","Located 90 miles or so from Memphis, the Fillmore Street Chapel is Corinth’s oldest place of worship. It was completed in 1871 and at one time served as a Presbyterian Church. From the outside, you’ll be amazed by awe-inspiring steeples and arched windows that act as mirrors reflecting Corinth’s scenery. Currently, Fillmore Street Chapel is maintained by the First United Methodist Church and its history and landmark status make it a popular venue for weddings, baptisms, and more. Whether you’re religiously inclined or not, Fillmore Street Chapel is well worth a visit, merely to see a beautiful historical landmark that is currently making history for people every year. "
Ship Island MS,"Once a single island, 1969’s hurricane split the land mass in two. Located some eleven miles south of Gulfport and Biloxi are some of Mississippi’s most magnificent beaches. Accessible by a 50-minute ferry ride on which you’ll see Bottlenose Dolphins at play, Ship Island is definitely the place to be for sun seekers and marine-life lovers alike. Ship Island offers affordable fun for families and individuals alike. Administered by the National Park Service, there’s loads to do across miles of tranquil beach and warm, gentle shoreline. If you’re a fan of history, you’ll be more than pleased to know that Ship Island played a vital role in the settlement up and down the gulf coast—its deep water anchorage providing French settlers with its name, which still stands to this day. "
Bluff Lake,"The beauty of nature and the tranquility of solitude combine at Bluff Lake to create memories that will last a lifetime. Bird watchers will appreciate the vast number of species on offer—included the endangered Red Cockaded Woodpecker. Meanwhile, fishermen will appreciate the quality of the sport available, and nature lovers will fall in love with just about everything on offer. Visiting Bluff Lake during the fall is truly magical: the crunching of leaves underfoot as you adore the orange and yellow and brown that envelopes you into a trance-like peaceful state is something that you’ll never quite get over. "
"Biloxi Lighthouse, Mississippi","Construction of the Biloxi Lighthouse was completed in 1848, making it one of the very first cast-iron lighthouses in the southern states. It is central to Biloxi’s image and has, since Katrina, become an iconic tribute to the city’s strength and resolve. Biloxi Lighthouse has a rather symbolic meaning for females in the area, thanks to its rather unique renown for having female lighthouse keepers, right up until the Coast Guard took on the lighthouse in 1939. Despite Hurricane Katrina’s storm surge battering a third of the lighthouse’s 64-foot tall stature, it stood firm, and the City of Biloxi re-opened it for tours in 2010, after an almost half-million dollar renovation. Whether you’re visiting Biloxi for its nightlife or culture, you’ll definitely want to visit this living tribute to the city’s triumph over Katrina’s destructive force. "
Vicksburg National Military Park,"The battle of Vicksburg was pivotal to the American Civil War—it included a 47-day siege which gave way to the surrender of the city, which gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River. Vicksburg National Military Park is run by the National Park Service in commemoration of this vital point in United States history, and to the lives of the soldiers that gave their lives throughout the campaign. Whether you’re a history lover or not, it’s impossible not to appreciate this national treasure. Over 1,300 historical monuments and markers are within the park’s bounds, as well as the melancholic Vicksburg National Cemetery—the resting place of over 18,000 people, of which two-thirds are unidentified. Over 500,000 visitors attend this haunting tribute to the battle of Vicksburg and the soldiers that gave their lives during; whether you wish to learn more about the civil war, or just pay your respects, Vicksburg National Military Park is a prime place to do either. "
Hiking Trail Along Bear Creek In Tishomingo State Park,"Rich in history and a breath-taking sight to boot, Tishomingo State Park takes its name from Chief Tishomingo, the leader of the Chickasaw nation. Archeological surveys have indicated that Paleo-Indians were active within the Park’s boundaries as far back as 7,000 B.C—and if that’s not enough to get you interested, the natural beauty and the array of activities on offer surely will! Dissected by the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Tishomingo State Park is a landscape of the likes you’ll only find in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains—imposing ferns scatter the ground, moss-covered boulders rise from their earthy domain, and colorful wildflowers add majesty to the harsh terrain. "
Clark Creek Nature Area,"Totaling over 700 acres and scattered with over 50 waterfalls, some of which stand over 30-feet tall, Clark Creek is a paradise for all naturists, hikers, cyclists, and outdoors lovers in general. Though the majority of the park is made up of large beech and magnolia trees, this hardwood forest also has some of the United States’ rarest flora on offer—all of which is clearly marked, helping visitors to stay out of trouble! Clark Creek Nature Area is a popular and beautiful state park, but do not be fooled: the terrain is tough going and it is highly recommended that you take the correct equipment! "
"Elvis Presley Birthplace, Tupelo, Mississippi","In 1935, few people local to Tupelo would have guessed that this area would become known as the birthplace of the King of Rock n’ Roll. Of course, Elvis Presley’s name and legacy will live on forever; and thanks to Elvis Presley Birthplace Park, so too will his birthplace. A couple of hours from Memphis, this museum is home to the place where the future music legend was born and has various personal effects on display for guests to view. If you’re a fan of Elvis, or even if you’re not, this small but impressive monument to the birth of one of the most iconic names in musical history is well worth a visit! "
"Noxubee Refuge, Starkville","Established in 1940, Noxubee Wildlife Refuge set out to repair the damage done by generations of intensive farming and grazing and provide habitat protection for species that direly needed it. This vast and beautiful refuge, covering three counties, has been a great success—it is now home to both wildlife and forests that were on the brink of destruction at the turn of the twentieth century. The landscape will take your breath away. The selection of wildlife—both native and migratory—on offer, is as impressive as you’ll find anywhere else in Mississippi. The Noxubee Refuge sees 150,000 visitors a year, and just by looking at it, it is easy to see why! "

Chisinau,"This is modern and friendly place is Moldova’s biggest city and serves as its capital. Chisinau has loads of green space, parks, and historical buildings. It feels like a city with space.  There’s also no shortage of restaurants, art galleries, nightclubs, spas, and casinos!  You’ll want to visit Pushkin Park and the orange pyramid at the World War II memorial. You’ll find marvellous frescoes in the Nativity Cathedral, and if that’s not for you, check out the stalls of the local modern artists in the art market. "
"The cross of Orheiul Vechi, Moldova","Just an hour outside of Chisinau is Orheiul, or Old Orhei, Moldova’s most incredible sight. It’s an archaeological complex with rich cultural and historical significance.  It’s also a place of stunning natural beauty. Overlooking the Raut River, this open-air complex features fortifications, baths, caves, ruins, and monasteries &#8211; all which date back as late as the Dacian tribes of 2000 years ago. The ancient monuments date from various periods including the Tatar and Mongol invasions, the 10th century BC, and more recently the occupation of the Golden Horde in the 14th century. Because of the unusualness of the area, a museum has been built that offer exhibits and provide information and context for such a unique place. "
Cricova Winery,"A quick 30 minutes from Chisinau is Cricova Winery.  The second largest underground winery in the world; it is definitely something to experience.  You’ll find 120 kilometres of complex roadways above ground and an elaborate tunnel system underground which has been in place since the 15th century when the limestone was dug out to build Chisinau. This wonderful “wine city” includes warehouses, underground tasting rooms, and guided tours. You’ll travel 100 metres below ground and have a look at what 1.25 million bottles of wine looks like. The wine industry is growing in Moldova, which means that it’s worth bringing a bottle or two home. "
Tipova Monastery,"Located in a remote but beautiful part of Moldova, Tipova Monastery comprises three main complexes that have been dug out of the rocks along the banks of the Dniestr River. The oldest complex is the Church of the Feast of the Holy Cross (11th century).  The remaining two are the Church of St Nicholas (14th century) and Horodiste (16th century). If you follow the path past the caves you’ll enjoy a nice nature hike that ends in a lovely waterfall. Within each cave are monk’s cells, enough for up to 700, though there are less than 20 monks living there now. "
Manastirea Curchi,"This monastery wins the award for the most beautiful in all of Moldova.  The complex is made up of five churches, a refectory, several abbeys, and monk cells.  Its beauty comes from the Bessarabia architectural style. The centrepiece for the complex is the Mother of God Church, built at the end of the 19th century. After you’ve explored the grounds and learnt about the unique history of the monastery (it was once a psychiatric hospital during the Soviet era) enjoy a nice stroll through the orchards. "
Cave monastery at Saharna,"This small village is the one that visitors most often say they’d love to return to.  The Holy Trinity Monastery is there, but it’s also a place of breathtaking natural beauty.  There is a silence and calmness that permeates the place – and you, after just a short time. Saharna is a pilgrimage place for many Moldavians because of a footprint on a rock which is believed to be the Virgin Mary’s. Nature lovers will for sure love Saharna. The River Saharna has 22 waterfalls – the most famous being “Gipsy Hole” (as it’s known by the locals). Enjoy hiking that offers incredible views of the surround area and the monastery below. "
Transdniestr,"This narrow strip of land on the Dniestr River is definitely one of the oddest places in Eastern Europe.  The government there has declared Transdniestr an independent republic. Though it’s a republic that doesn’t officially exist anywhere else but there.  Officially still a part of Moldova; the locals here believe they won their independence during a civil war in 1992. Transdniestr has its own currency, police force, and borders while still clinging to a Soviet era aesthetic throughout the region.  You’ll see plenty of Lenin busts as you’re exploring. The unofficial capital city at Tiraspol will be one of the strangest looking places you’ll see in Moldova. "
Bendery,"One of Transdniestr&#8217;s three cities, Bendery is the greener and more aesthetically pleasing counterpart to Tiraspol.  Though you can still see the bullet holes that remain from the civil war with Moldova, the city itself is friendly and fun.  Be sure to check out the fortress, built in the 16th century.  It’s changed hands a number of times and is a great reflection of the history of the city. "
Gagauzia,"The Gagauzia region is an autonomous non-contiguous stretch of land made up of three towns and 27 villages.  The culture and heritage here is primarily influenced by Turkey and although the people are largely Christians, their ancestors were Muslim refugees fleeing from war and looking for a place to lay roots.  They were permitted to stay in this region only if they converted.  With such a distinct history, you can image that the area is intriguing. Visit the Comrat Regional History Museum to get a glimpse of what daily life is like here. "
Fortress of Soroca,"Soroca has played a large and important role throughout Moldova’s history due to its location on the Dniestr River. During wars and sieges, armies were able to defend the country well from this vantage point.  The highlight is Soroca Fortress, one in a chain of military strongholds built as early as the 14th century by princes looking to fortify their position against invaders.  Because of the large Roma community here, Soroca is the unofficial Roma capital.  For fun, walk by the mansions of the Roma elite that line the streets of the city centre. "
Padurea Domneasca,"Founded in 1993, this is the largest natural reserve in Moldova and is located in Glodeni. Here you’ll find the country’s oldest stand of old-growth oak tree where the oldest oak is estimated to be about 450 years old.  Nature lovers will enjoy the many bird species with the most notable being the herons that nest near the river.  Discover the area known as “One Hundred Hills,” a landscape of rolling knolls &#8211; that no one understands how they were formed. Padurea Domneasca is a great way to spend a day outdoors with Mother Nature. "
Capriana Monastery,"Sitting in a lush green forest in Capriana is one of the oldest monasteries in Moldova.  Founded in the 15th century by Alexander the Good, it was once the home of the Moldavian bishop as well as Chiprian, one of the first Moldavian poets.  It houses the largest convent library in the country and after years of neglect, was reopened in 1989 as a symbol of national revival. While you’re there, you can make some stops nearby to visit the oak tree of Stefan the Great and Codru, the oldest nature reserve in the country. "
Codru Monastery,"The most popular (as well as oldest!) reserve in the country, Codru lies in the centre of Moldova and is made up of a series of magnificent ravines and valleys. You’ll find over 1000 species of protected plants, 145 bird species, 43 mammal species, seven reptile species, and more. There is a natural history museum on the reserve worth checking out in between solo or guided hikes. You’ll love the wide open feeling of this popular reserve. "
Kvint,"You can purchase a bottle of some of Europe’s best cognac at the entrance gate to the Kvint factory.  They’ve been making top-quality cognac here since 1897 and even buying from the street vendors here will give you value for your money. Located in quirky Tiraspol, the locals consider Kvint to be a national symbol and its image is even on the Transnistrian five ruble banknote. They produce about ten million litres a year and you can sign up for a daily tasting tour. "
Taul Park,"Located in Taul Village, Taul Park is the largest in the country.  Inside the park is the stately manor house of Ivan Pommer, which was built at the beginning of the 20th century.  It’s a testament to landscape architecture and was highly revered in its time. The park itself is comprised of two parts.  The upper part is where you’ll find the manor house with tons of footpaths being swallowed by amazing flower beds.  The lower park feels more like a forest.  Various tree groups have been planted and each group is characteristic of a different geographical area.  Discover 150 varieties of trees and bushes – many exotic – when you walk the 12.5k of trails. "
Monte Carlo,"Your first stop will undoubtedly be Monte Carlo where comfort and lavishness rule.  This is the district that everyone thinks of when they think of Monaco. It’s fabulous for people watching – and car watching for that matter.  Not to be outdone by man-made magnificence, the natural beauty of Monte Carlo will take your breath away.  The district is located on a promontory that has fantastic views of the Port of Monaco.  You’ll also find incredible seaside views from Place du Casino. For dinner try one of three Michelin-starred restaurants and after take a walk down Princesse Charlotte Boulevard or Boulevard des Moulins.  Both offer haute couture shopping and luxury boutiques. If you can handle more decadence, don’t forget the Opera House. "
Palais du Prince,"The oldest monarchy in the world calls The Palais du Prince home.  Established in 1297 by the Genoese family of Grimaldi, the site was chosen for its location high above sea level on the lovely peninsula of Le Rocher. It was originally built in the 13th century as a strong defensive fortress. From generation to generation, the palace has been transformed into what it is today:  a magnificent palace in the style of Louis XIV. Visitors can tour the State Apartments when the royal family is away.  Inside you’ll find an Italiante gallery with 15th century frescoes, the wood panelled Mazarin Room, the Blue Room, which is covered in blue and gold, and the Throne Room with its oversized Renaissance fireplace.  Each day at 11:55am the traditional Changing of the Guard takes place at the palace gate. "
Musée Oceanographique,"Ninety metres above sea level, on Le Rocher, is the Musée Oceanographique, the world oldest aquarium. Commissioned by Prince Albert I and opened in 1910, the Musée Oceanographique is known around the world for its exhibits on oceanography and marine science.  Several discoveries of Jacques-Yves Cousteau are on display. But the real highlights are the rare species you’ll find in all sizes, shapes, and colours.  There are three aquariums with over 6,000 specimens in 100 pools.  You’ll love Turtle Island and the Touch Tank, where you can discover for yourself what a sea urchin feels like or even hold a baby shark.  The latest instalment is the Shark Lagoon, which measures about 450 cubic metres where you can see the most extraordinary colours of the coral reef and the many creatures that live there.  After you’ve been through the exhibits and the museum, enjoy a superb meal at rooftop restaurant and take in the coastline below. "
Jardin Exotique,"Located in the Fontvielle area, just outside the city centre, the Jardin Exotique is pure sensory overload.  With lush vegetation and awe-inspiring views of the sea, this exotic garden is beautiful beyond words.  Tropical plants thrive here due to the consistent balmy weather. You’ll find species from Mexico, Africa, and beyond, with over 7,000 varieties of succulents.  Open since 1933 there is also an Observatory Cave with wonderfully fun stalagmites and stalactites. A visit to the Anthropology Museum on site will teach you about the prehistoric era and the prehistoric man that once lived in the vicinity of the cave. "
The Cathedral,"The burial places for all the Princes of Monaco, this Roman-Byzantine cathedral is made from stunning white stones brought from La Turbie nearby.  You can visit the tombs of Prince Rainer and Princess Grace. Built in the late 19th century you’ll find older treasures like an altarpiece by Louis Bréadating, which dates from the 16th century, and Carrar, the white marble Episcopal throne. Be sure to check out the grand organ that’s regularly used for concerts and religious services.  From September to June you can hear the &#8220;Les Petits Chanteurs de Monaco&#8221; and the &#8220;Cathedral Choir” sing mass each Sunday. "
View from Les Jardins Saint-Martin,"Located close the Musée Océanographique and overlooking calm blue sea is the Les Jardins Saint-Martin. There you’ll find a statue honouring Prince Albert I, a well respected marine researcher.  The gardens extend down the coast to Le Rocher peninsula and the steep sea-cliff there.  Exotic species thrive under the generous Mediterranean sunshine.  These gardens are ideal for strolling as there is an intricate system of paths that cross the rocky slopes and ridges.  The designers have done a wonderful job of adding in fountains, ponds, and small viewpoints with wonderful views. "
Formula One Monaco Grand Prix,"Every year during the last week of May, the famous Formula One Grand Prix takes place in Monte Carlo. The course begins on the Boulevard Albert I, turns up toward Place du Casino, and then around a rather harrowing turn in front of the Monte Carlo Fairmont Hotel.  It’s the only car race on earth that’s run on city streets. This is easily one of the world’s most popular sports events.  Despite the narrow streets, the race continues each year out of a sense of tradition.  A good view is difficult but the atmosphere is well worth the visit.  Tie in the Grand Prix with the Cannes Film Festival on the nearby French Riviera – also held in May. "
Monte Carlo Opera House,"Inside the sumptuous public square of Place du Casino, is the Monte Carlo Opera House.  This is Monaco’s most opulent neighbourhood – complete with palm trees, a spectacular fountain, and a terrace with gorgeous coastline views. Built in 1878, the Opera House compliments the neighbourhood perfectly.  Built by the same man who designed the equally famous opera house in Paris, the auditorium is decorated in lush red and gold, beautiful frescoes, and stunning sculptures.  Opera season is from November to June and offers classics like Rossini, Mozart, and Puccini. "
Port de la Condamine,"Are you surprised to learn that Monaco’s harbour is packed with yachts?  In the shape of a square, the Port de la Condamine was completed in 1926 and designed to hold a large number of luxury vessels – even the Prince docks his private vessel here.  The Yacht Club in front of the marine has over 1,000 members from all over the world and hosts races and festivals throughout the year. Enjoy a walk along the port area and stop for a snack at an outdoor cafe or restaurant.  You can also take catamaran ride around Monaco to see the striking coastline. "
Princess Grace Rose Garden,"Created by Prince Rainer III as a tribute to Princess Grace, the rose garden has been open since 1984.  Located in Fontvielle Park it covers about four hectares that include a palm tree lined lake and a lovely olive grove. It was awarded the label of “Ecological Garden” thanks to the eco-friendly practices used to maintain the park.  Inside are 300 varieties and over 8,000 rose bushes.  If you’re a garden or a serious rose enthusiast, each rose has an identifying QR code.  Relax on the many park benches, admire the sculptures, take a walk along the many footpaths, and generally just take it easy in this tranquil setting. "
Monaco Ville,"This is where you’ll find the old Monaco.  Monaco Ville still has its small medieval lane from when it was a stronghold of the Grimaldi dynasty. To get there, you can walk up the Rampe Major, a red-brick path built in the 16th century.  The walk will take you back the statue of the late Prince Rainer looking down on his beloved country.  Be prepared to do some climbing! Monaco Ville is located at the top of a large rock cliff. "
Jardin Japonais,"Built into a steep hillside on the eastern end of the country, this authentic Japanese garden is truly a must-see.  The Jardin Japonais is a lush Zen garden complete with water, stones, and vegetation.  It’s just over 7,000 square metres and inside you’ll discover a beach, a pristine stream, and even a rushing waterfall.  If you’re looking for serenity, this is your place.  Built to be a small piece of paradise between Monte Carlo and Larvotto, it definitely lives up to that vision.  Bring your meditation cushion and contemplation and meditation are encouraged. "
Nouveau Musée National de Monaco,"The Nouveau Musée National is housed in two separate villas: the Villa Sauber and the Villa Paloma.  The exhibits showcase contemporary art as well as avant-garde photography, drawings, and paintings. At Villa Sauber the theme is performing arts and at Villa Paloma it’s the environment that is the focus of the artists on display. It’s a progressive museum dedicated to conservation and you can see many of their labours on display – like several theatre costumes. It’s an interesting and unique place to explore for an afternoon. "
Fort Antoine,"Once a military fortress and now an outdoor theatre, Fort Antoine is on the northeast edge of Le Rocher.  Enjoy a warm summer evenings enjoy incredible performances under a starry sky.  There’s room for 350 and all performances are in French and free to the public (though you must get a ticket first).  Come early to enjoy the view of the French Riviera coastline as it extends all the way to Italy. "
Sainte-Dévote Chapel,"Dedicated to the patron saint of Monaco, this Roman Catholic chapel can be dated back to the 11th century.  It has undergone much renovation over the century and suffered some damage during World War II.  Traditionally, the bride of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco will lay her bridal bouquet in the chapel after the wedding ceremony. It also lies along the route of the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix. "
Karakorum,"Set deep between the undulating green hills and stony ridges of the Orkhon Valley, the fabled ancient city of Karakorum is now the stuff of myth and legend. But follow the sporadic cobbled lanes that weave around the mountains in the very heart of Mongolia, and you&#8217;ll discover that it did certainly exist. Ruined grain silos and stone turtles, kiln smelting houses and crumbling ancient stupas still spot the ground; an aging testimony to the former might of this Mongol capital on the steppe. Today, it&#8217;s the place to come to walk in the footsteps of totemic figures like Genghis Khan, and to see interesting Buddhist monasteries next to gorgeous Yuan Dynasty temple shrines. "
Terelj National Park,"The rising peaks and ochre-hued ridges of the Gorkhi-Terelj National Park shoulder their way above the horizon just north of Ulaanbaatar&#8217;s concrete sprawl. The reserve represents one of the most accessible examples of Mongolia&#8217;s backcountry (thanks to the proximity to the capital), with pine-studded mountain valleys and sculpted rock formations all peppering the vistas. The southern portion of the park is well-suited to visitors. There, you&#8217;ll discover nomad camps and camel farms. Meanwhile, the north includes the alpine Khagiin Khar Lake and a series of bubbling hot springs to boot. "
Lake Khovsgol,"A great dash of blue that hides between the shale peaks and rocky foothills of the Sayan Mountains, Lake Khovsgol is the second-largest body of water in all of Mongolia. It filters down from the Russian border in a streak of deep blue, its grassy banks rising and falling, peppered with the occasional wind-blasted pine tree, and sometimes giving way to pebble coves where locals relax in the summer. The whole site is now encompassed by a national park, which was instituted to protect the waters here. And what waters they are! It&#8217;s said that Lake Khovsgol is filled with drinkable water that needs no treatment, and the geological history of the spot goes back a whopping two million years. "
Altai Tavan Bogd National Park,"The mighty Altai Tavan Bogd National Park rises like a bulwark against the tristate join of China, Russia, and Kazakhstan. It bars the way to Siberia and snow-dusted Xinjiang with a series of more than five rugged peaks that rise to a whopping 4,000 meters above sea level or more. Hardy creatures make their home here, in the form of hoofed ibexes and Tuvan nomad tribespeople. The latter&#8217;s yurts pepper the banks of pretty Dayan Nuur by summertime, and it&#8217;s possible to watch the legendary eagle hunters do their thing in the low-lying plains. "
Orkhon Valley,"Once the home of the great Khans and the epicenter of power that fueled the onslaught of the Mongol Horde across Asia and Europe, the Orkhon Valley has been trodden by totemic names like Genghis and Kublai. Today, this rich history is honored with a UNESCO World Heritage Tag, which also celebrates the deeper traditions of nomad living; still seen today, when white-fabric yurts pop up between the gallery pines. Of course, Orkhon is now a major attraction, and travelers flock to see the ruins of legendary Karakorum, seek the fabled palaces of Xanadu, wonder at frozen waterfalls, and find serenity in the rustic Buddhist monasteries. "
Khustain Nuruu National Park,"If you&#8217;re lucky, you should just be able to spot some of the uber-rare Dzungarian horses galloping over the grassy knolls and rock-ribbed ridges of the Khustain Nuruu National Park. These are one of the most iconic creatures of the steppe, and are only known to reside below the rising peaks close to Ulaanbaatar (even if they have had to be reintroduced to the area by conservationists). Once you&#8217;ve paid the meagre entrance fee, be sure to hit the managed walking routes, or opt for a heart-thumping 4X4 ride over the hilly peaks and troughs. "
Ulaanbaatar,"With its sterile concrete sprawl and reflective glass skyscrapers, endless neighborhoods of Soviet-style blocks and constant need for expansion, Ulaanbaatar is pretty much everything you expect Mongolia not to be. It&#8217;s brash, bold, big and loud, and comes packed with designer outlets and all-new shopping malls. But there&#8217;s a certain crude charm to be found below the bright lights too, whether that’s in the 19th-century palace of Bogd Khaan, built by the Mongolian masters, the fascinating National Museum of Mongolia, the wide squares where locals chatter, or in the shadow of Genghis Kahn&#8217;s great monument. "
Altai Kazakh Eagle Festival,"Olgii is overshadowed by the hulking and sinewy massifs of the great Altai. They dominate the horizon all around the town, and loom as if to demand the attention of any who pass this way. It&#8217;s only once you&#8217;ve managed to get over the breathtaking and haunting panoramas that you can begin to properly enjoy this provincial capital of Bayan-Olgii. "
Khorgo Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur National Park,"Dominating the wild reaches of the Mongolian north-west, this beautiful swathe of protected land has plenty of awesome sights in its arsenal. Look up and you&#8217;ll see the splintered caldera of Khorgo Volcano: an extinct mountain that once ravaged the surrounding valleys with its pyroclastic flows and ash plumes. Today, climbing the 2,240-meter-high peak is possible, and it reveals wonderful panoramas of the volcanic ridges and lakes that spread out all around. And talking of lakes, this is the home of Lake Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur, where marsh deer and chitals wander between the rock-built yurts of nomad herders. "
Khangai Nuruu National Park,"Not to be confused with its similarly-named brother to the west – the Khustain Nuruu National Park – this huge area of land in the depths of the Orkhon Valley is one of the largest in the nation (even if it hardly comes close to the vastness of the Gobi, but more on that later). It&#8217;s quintessential steppe from beginning to end. You&#8217;ll see the sweeping grasslands rise and fall as they roll out into the distance. You&#8217;ll wonder as streams break through the bluffs and crash as waterfalls into ice-cold plunge pools. You&#8217;ll ride horses with nomads, and sleep in traditional yurt villages as the fire crackles nearby. Talk about experiencing the real Mongolia! "
Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park,"The point where the snow-dusted steppe crashes into the sand sea of the sweeping Gobi Desert is a place unlike anywhere else on earth. It can be found in the southern depths of Mongolia, hemmed in by an amphitheater of ice-caked peaks. Inhospitable and bitterly cold, hardly any humans make their home here. Those that do come dressed in tough cashmere-hair jerkins, and spend their days wandering the plains with ger tents in tow. Travelers who brave the wilderness of Gobi Gurvansaikhan will get to see natural wonders like the singing dunes of Khongoryn Els, and the chiseled gorges of the Yolyn Am. So, saddle up the camel and explore… "
Erdenet,"You might have heard of the legendary archers of Erdenet, who are famous throughout the steppe for their quick aim and accuracy. What you might not know is that their home is one of the few built-up, urban spots in Mongolia, and, with 75,000 people, the second-largest town overall. In fact, Erdenet started life as a mining service center; its raison d&#8217;être the great open-faced copper quarries nearby. "
Moron,"It’s easy to write Moron off as just the gateway to Lake Khovsgol and the popular summertime pastures of the northern steppe. And while it&#8217;s true that this provincial city certainly deals with its fair share of passing tourists on their way to those attractions, it&#8217;s also got a decent scene of its own. There are schools and pretty parks; a clutch of good Mongolian eateries, and a medley of Buddha statues and eye-wateringly beautiful architecture at the nearby Danzadardscha Khiid Monastery. What&#8217;s more, Moron remains one of the few domestic cities accessible on direct flight routes from Ulaanbaatar. "

But it&#8217;s more than that too – it&#8217;s also the gateway to the great waters of Khar Us Lake. These spread out under the snowy peaks of Jargalant Mountain, offering trails for horse riders and marshlands laden with gulls. "

Rodeo,"This town bordering Canada has stayed true to its old-time charm. Many of the buildings were built in the late 1800s, like an old school, general store, library, and roads of log cabins. Because of this unique flair, locals seemed to have embrace their unique identity. It’s common to have events every day of the week – often many of them are rodeo themed.

Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex,"Augusta is a tiny town of just 300 residents that’s the last “cow town” in the west.

Bay of Kotor,"One of the most popular tourist destinations in Montenegro, the Bay of Kotor, and by extension the walled town of Kotor, has so much life and character.  The area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to the picturesque old town and active harbour.  If you like, you can climb the 1500 steps to the fortress that overlooks the town.

Budva,"Located on the Adriatic Sea and part of the Budva Riviera, Budva is famous for its nightlife and sandy beaches.  If you’re looking for a place to let loose and party, this is exactly where you want to be.  Before the party picks up, take a walk through narrow streets of Stari Grad, or Old Town, one of the most charming parts of town. In the historic district you’ll find a seaside citadel and the Church of Santa Maria in Punta, built in the 9th century.  Budva is a big draw for those with multi-million dollar yachts – and a stroll through the marina is great for daydreaming and picking out which vessel you prefer. "
Sveti Stefen,"Fifteen minutes from Budva is Sveti Stefan, an icon of Montenegrin tourism. Frequented by the rich and famous, the small islet was once a fishing village and the old town remains largely unchanged with its narrow streets, small churches, and family shops. Sveti Stefan largely declined in the 20th century (with only 20 inhabitants recorded in 1954) but in the 1960’s a group of visionaries transformed the town into one of most attractive and luxurious destinations in all of the Mediterranean. To visit the island you must be a resort guest, but the north and south beaches are open to all throughout the year. "
Cetinje,"The former capital of Montenegro is now a backpacking haven thanks to the extraordinary mountain range that sits just behind Kotor and Perast. In the main square of Cetinje you’ll find the former home of King Nikola which has been converted into a museum.  In fact, there are several museums in town all within walking distance. The main attraction here is the Cetinje Monastery, originally built in the 15th century.  Though its been destroyed a number of times over the centuries and the current incarnation dates from the 18th century. Here you can visit a shard of the True Cross and the mummified right hand of St. John the Baptist. "
Njegos Mausoleum,"Just 40 minutes from Cetinje is the fantastic Lovcen National Park, and the pièce de résistance is the 1750m majestic Mount Lovcen. In addition to the fresh outdoors, most people visit Lovcen in order to visit the Njegos Mausoleum.  Located on Mount Jezerski, the park’s second highest peak, the tomb holds the remains of Montenegro’s greatest hero, Petar II Petrovic Njeos. The mausoleum itself has been built into the mountain and laid with marble. You have to walk the last 500 steps or so, but it’s worth it.  On a clear day you can see almost the entire country – and it’s spectacular.  George Bernard Shaw even said, “Am I in paradise or am I on the moon?” "
Ostrog Monastery,"Nine hundred metres above the Zeta Valley is the luminous Ostrog Monastery. It’s the most important religious site in Montenegro for Orthodox Christians.  Up to one million visitors come here annually to see this strange and arresting place. In the busy summer months, pilgrims are given free mats to sleep on in front of the Upper Monastery.  This impressive monastery is often called “Sv Vasilije’s miracle” because it’s a mystery how it was built.  Finished in the 17th century it appears to have simply grown out of the rock.  Enjoy the frescoes in the Holy Trinity Church and the natural spring that you can drink from to receive a blessing. "
Ruins of Haj-Nehaj,"Built in the 15th century by the Venetians who were attempting to defend the country from the Ottoman Empire, this is one of the most majestic fortresses in the country. To reach it you must take a steep but phenomenal walk 30 minutes through the pines.  The stone path eventually leads you to the gate and the fortress rising behind.  This is another landmark that will leave you wondering how in the world it was built. Inside you can explore the ruins as you walk through a grassy area of wildflowers and sage.  Above the fortress sits St. Demetrius’ Church (13th century). It predates the fortress and once had separate Orthodox and Catholic altars "
Piva Canyon,"Part of the fun of Piva Canyon is getting to it.  The road tangos with the river and clings precipitously to the cliff in several places. You have to pass through 56 tunnels carved out of the mountain after World War II. But once you’re there, you’ll be rewarded with the site of Lake Piva sitting beautifully in the Piva Canyon. You’ll want to visit Piva Monastery which was painstakingly moved to higher ground, over the course of 11 years, when the hydroelectric dam at Plužine was built. It’s a perfect place for rafting and camping. "
Stari Bar,"Once part of the Roman Empire, Stari Bar was the economic and political centre for the Byzantines of the region.  Now, the ruins of that long gone era sit at the top of sheer cliff faces accessible only from one point.  There is a small museum inside with exhibits of artefacts dating back to 800 BC. It will also give you a great recounting of the history of the place, including the 19th century bombing by Montenegro in its efforts to take back the town from the Turks. Visit St. Nicholas’ Church with its Serbo-Byzantine frescoes, the 11th century fortress, and St George’s Cathedral, Stari Bar’s patron saint. If you’re interested in Ottoman architecture, take a look at the Turkish bathhouse, the clock tower, and the 17th century aqueduct which carried water from 3km outside of town. "
Tara River and Canyon,"Second only to the Colorado River Canyon, Tara Canyon is known as the “Tear of Europe” is a magnificent sight.  Untamed natural beauty has been forged as the river has cut its way through the canyon.  You’ll find river paths, breathtaking gorges, waterfalls, and even tranquil stretches of river.  Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, Tara Canyon reaches 1300 metres deep.  If you need some context, the United States Grand Canyon is roughly 1500 metres.  One of the most popular tourist attractions in Montenegro is rafting down the Tara River.  For those who prefer land activities, enjoy hiking around Mt Curevac, which reaches 1625 metres high. "
Biogradska Gora National Park,"Located between the Tara and Lim rivers is National Park Biogradska Gora. You’ll find old forests, clear lakes, and lovely pastures here.  But in the heart of the park is something truly incredible. First is the virgin forest.  And the in the heart of this unbelievable virgin forest is Biogradska lake, a truly remarkable glacier lake. The park boasts six glacial lakes, mountain peaks over 2000 metres, archaeological sites, sacred monuments, and several buildings built in traditional architecture. Nature lovers will enjoy the 26 distinct habits, 200 plant varieties, 150 bird species, and 10 types of mammals. "
"Fez, Morocco","Fez has all the treats and draws you&#8217;d expect of a 1,200-year-old Maghreb city. There&#8217;s Fès el-Bali, the historic heart of the place, where a labyrinth (and we don&#8217;t use the word lightly!) of lanes and staircases and squares coalesce between the multi-coloured tanneries and the adobe cottages. Then there&#8217;s the elegant boulevards of Ville Nouvelle. Here, the French worked to create beautiful palm-peppered avenues and babbling fountains, opulent hotels and Parisian-flavoured streets. So, move between the spice-packed souks and the fabled madrassahs, and try to get a feel for the real Morocco here. "
Marrakech,"Ah, Marrakech: the quintessential medina town of the Moroccan Maghreb. The onetime piece de resistance in the crown of the Almoravid dynasty, it sits sparkling in hues of ochre and beige stone beneath the scintillating tips of the Atlas Mountains. At its heart is the colossal Jemaa el-Fnaa Square; the busiest in Africa and the hub of a great bazaar where everything from handwoven carpets mingle with shisha pipes and swinging golden lanterns. Meanwhile, the medina also bursts with arabesque riad homes, their courtyards hiding mint-scented teahouses or some of the tastiest tagines you&#8217;ll ever discover. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the Royal and Bahia palaces – a leftover from the sultans and the viziers that ruled these lands. "
Casablanca,"Known to many as the namesake and setting of Michael Curtiz&#8217;s 1942 magnum opus (entitled just Casablanca), the port city of Casablanca still reigns as the country&#8217;s largest, and the largest in the entire region of the Maghreb besides. Booming forth onto the Atlantic coast midway between Rabat and El Jadida, it&#8217;s laden with row upon row of elegant Mauresque architecture – a unique fusion of the arabesque and the Parisian that&#8217;s seen on every roundabout and public square. There is a small medina area, but the modern draws are of a different, more colossal character: the great King Hassan II Mosque (considered the largest in Morocco); the winding Corniche, peppered with super-clubs and chic hotels; the endless Morocco Mall – the second-biggest shopping center on the continent! "
Meknes,"Oft referred to by its official UNESCO name, the Historic City of Meknes, this stopover on the route from Rabat on the coast to Fez under the rises of the Atlas Mountains, is a great place to wonder at the country&#8217;s fusion of Spanish and Moorish styles. Raised to greatness by the Sultan Moulay Ismaïl during the 18th century, it&#8217;s got an enchanting medina that starts with the crenulations and motifs of the great Bab El Khemis Gate and ends with the elegant filigrees and inlays of the Dar El Makhzen royal palace. Of course, there&#8217;s also a traditional souk here – even if it&#8217;s much smaller than the one at Fez and Marrakech – along with more spice-scented tagine houses than you can shake a dried apricot at! "
Merzouga,"The shifting desert dunes take over in earnest around the truly breathtaking town of Merzouga. Set deep in the country, on the eastward side of the Atlas ranges, this onetime camel caravan town is now a picture of the quintessential Sahara we all know from films. Head for the great sand mounds of Erg Chebbi, which come sculpted by the ceaseless breezes of the desert. Or, take a camel ride into the borderlands with Algeria, to get lost between the ochre-yellow landscapes and the occasional nomad town where few other visitors will venture. "
Rabat,"Steeped in the styles of the Moors and Spanish, Rabat not only boasts some of the best museums and art galleries in the country (check out the National Archaeological Museum and the Modern Art Museum) but also a prime location on the edge of the Atlantic. Hit the lively corniche that weaves along the shore, or see the sparkling beach that lurks beneath the tower of the great Almohadan Citadel. The earthy Berber heart of Rabat is really the place to be though. Named Oudaias Kasbah, it&#8217;s here that you&#8217;ll find those much-photographed alleyways of blue-and-white homes, winding and weaving up and down stairs, through hidden squares, and down towards the historic medina center. "
"Tangier, Morocco","Tangier heralds the African side of the Gibraltar Strait. A port town and a fortress that patrolled the entrance to the Med, it has been coveted by naval powers in these parts ever since the Carthaginians ruled the waves. However, while the history remains palpable – especially amidst the historic medina and beneath the great Kasbah of the erstwhile Sultan of Tangier – this town now beats to a more modern tune. The beaches and beachside haunts along the Avenue Mohammed VI throb with life on the weekend, Spanish holidaymakers arrive on fast ferries from Algeciras across the water, there are enticing organic eateries, and plenty, plenty more! "
El Jadida,"The great bulwarks of the El Jadida fort rise from the ocean like something out of Game of Thrones. They are just one – and certainly the most noticeable – reminder of the town&#8217;s unique history as a colony of not the French, nor the Spanish, but the Portuguese. You&#8217;ll see that influence in the baroque-topped churches and the between the synagogues of the Jewish Quarter, while heading to the seaside promenades and enjoying a mint tea in the salty breeze is just one example of how life&#8217;s a little more laid back in El Jadida than other centers like Fez and Marrakech. Don&#8217;t miss the beaches either, which are the main reason for those booming summertime weekend crowds! "
Essaouira,"Essaouira forms the northern end of the long stretch of beaches that runs all the way form Agadir (Morocco&#8217;s other favourite resort town on the sea – wait for it!). As a town, it&#8217;s perhaps best known for its wealth of formidable 18th-century fortifications, which rise from the Atlantic Ocean in a series of keeps and crenulated lookouts. It&#8217;s also famed for its cooling sea winds, which draw oodles of visitors from the sultry medina towns inland during the warmer months of the year. Unfortunately, this renders the sands close to Essaouira itself too blustery for combing and chilling. Still, there are harbours and awesome seafood to make up for that! "
Agadir,"Sun-kissed Agadir rises from the salty shore of the African Atlantic in a medley of colourful homes and whitewashed Berber dives. For years now it&#8217;s been the chosen haunt of the beach-loving, surf-seeking traveler making their way to Morocco. And it&#8217;s really filled the role well. Hotel resorts spill out of their palm-dotted gardens on the sea to offer up countless sunbathing opportunities on the main beach, while board riders attempt to conquer the roaring left-to-righters at famous surf spots like Devils Rock and Cro-Cro. After dark you can look forward to one of the country&#8217;s best nightlife scenes too, with chances to sample traditional English ales in the pubs and whiskey-infused teas in the Moroccan riads. Nice. "
Oukaimeden,"Ever wondered what it might be like donning the skis and salotpettes some 2,600 meters above the dusty lands of the Sahara Desert and the sweeping fields of citrus fruits that spread out to the north, throughout the Maghreb? Well, Oukaimeden is your chance to find out! Perched high atop the Atlas Mountains, it&#8217;s the highest ski resort in all of Africa (okay, there aren&#8217;t really many, but still!). Just 45 miles from the city of Marrakech, it makes for the perfect detour from the North African heat. You&#8217;ll discover five individual runs, a series of drag lifts, a ski school, rental facilities and breathtaking views over the rugged tip of Jebel Attar. "
Al Hoceima,"A cocktail of the Andalusian influence and the traditional Berber character (which remains stronger here than in most all other cities found cascading down the ridges of the Rif Mountains in the north of the country), Al Hoceima is a chilled and charming place. Its location is truly gorgeous, with shimmering beaches of gold sand spilling out onto the Med between rugged walls of cliffs. What&#8217;s more, a clutch of great hotels and charming teahouses aside, the center often doffs its cap in favour of the legendary Rocade road that runs along the coast to the east and west. This is where you&#8217;ll become immersed in grassy cliffs and soaring seaside mountains, carved gorges and more – it&#8217;s like Morocco&#8217;s answer to the Amalfi Coast! "
Chefchaouen,"A maze of winding streets and tight-knit passageways gives the legendary blue city (sorry Jodhpur!) of Chefchaouen a unique charm all of its own. The handsome looks are only made better by the location too: the town spills its way down the green-brown ridges of the Rif Mountains, between the beautiful likes of Jebel al-Kalaa and the protected reserves of the Talasemtane (both of which are accessible on hiking expeditions). However, it&#8217;s just wandering and wondering that tie most tourists over here. So, settle for a mint tea in one of the local teahouses and watch as the hazy blue of the hill town ticks over to its local Berber vibes. "
Ouarzazate,"Rising from the fringes of the Morccan Sahara in a medley of beige and brown adobe keeps and bulwarks, the aged trading outpost of Ouarzazate is used to receiving visitors from afar. For centuries the camel caravans and merchants coming from the Med and Central Africa stopped here to flog their wares to the people of the impossibly beautiful Dades Valley. Today, the old bazaar remains: a dusty conglomeration of holes-in-the-wall and emporiums that stacked with curious trinkets and goods. Head to the nearby town of Aït Benhaddou to see an impressive UNESCO site where films like Kingdom of Heaven and Prince of Persia have been filmed! "
Asilah,"You could be forgiven for thinking that you were travelling beneath the whitewashed cubist villages of the Greek Aegean Islands, not a coastal town on the far reaches of North Africa, when roaming between the sun-baked promenade and the glowing interior alleyways of pretty Asilah. An artsy, creative place, the town shares its draws between the enticing little independent craft galleries that pepper the center and the run of dune-backed beaches that extend to the north and south – a surfer&#8217;s dream! One disclaimer: Asilah can often get busy during the height of the season. Not only is it popular with locals coming from the capital, but it&#8217;s the first real resort you meet coming south from the Spanish ferries of Tangier. "
Bazaruto Archipelago,"There&#8217;s nothing quite like the Bazaruto Archipelago. A speckling of elongated isles in the Indian Ocean, they are a patchwork of shimmering, aquamarine seas and coral gardens, windblown sand dunes and ochre-hued coastal hills that come peppered with scrub and swaying coconut palm groves. The largest island of the area (called, simply, just Bazaruto) is a place of open sandy bays patrolled by galumphing dugong, while the inland is carved through by karst hills and boulder stones. A little to the south and you&#8217;ll find the paradisiacal reaches of the Ilha de Benguerra, where luxurious honeymoon hotels poke above the white sands in a medley of swinging hammocks and sunning decks. "
Casa do Ferro,"Mozambique&#8217;s handsome capital is a lesson in all things colonial. It was raised to the place of first city after the Portuguese drained the surrounding swampland. Then it was just a case of building the grand, imperial likes of the railway station, the pretty Casa do Ferro (courtesy of one Gustav Eiffel no less!) and rings of wide boulevards peppered with palm trees a la the Algarve &#8211; bingo you&#8217;ve got yourself a small enclave of Europe in Africa! However, Maputo has long been reclaimed by the locals here, and today the town is known for its enthralling bazaars that pulse with chatter and burst with East African batik, its raucous hip hop bars, and that mouthwatering fusion of Keralan and Arabic foods in the eateries! "
Pemba,"Pemba crowns the tip of its very own peninsular on the coastal reaches of Cabo Delgado. Known for its gorgeous colonial architecture and pretty Portuguese-style frontispieces, it does well to conceal the more industrial areas that have popped up here of late. However, the city never really was the pull. That honour goes to the strings of pearly-white African beaches that run along the shoreline nearby. These magnetise huge crowds with their tropical sun and swaying palms, while the shimmering (and naturally deep) waters of Pemba Bay have become a mecca for SCUBA divers. You can also come and visit rustic fishing villages between the coves of Ibo Island, hit the beautiful Quirimbas National Park, wander between forests of great baobabs, or see the sobering remnants of the slave trade at Ponta Romero. "
Gorongosa National Park,"Marking the deep southern reaches of the East African Rift Valley, the dry and dusty landscapes of the Gorongosa National Park occupy the very heart of Mozambique. In fact, the rolling savannah and grassy hills here have been a designated reserve since the days of Portuguese rule, when they were a private game reserve for the colonial luminaries of the day. In the 60s the spot was converted into a fully-fledged national park, and now it&#8217;s hailed as perhaps the finest safari destination in the country. Head here to seek out bouncing bushbuck, elephant herds, waterbucks, crowned cranes, wild warthogs and more! "
Tofo,"A wide and sunny arc of powdery beige sand carves its way along the shoreline to the north and south of tropical Tofo. Meanwhile, the turquoise-blue rollers of the Indian Ocean buffet the bays, snorkelers and swimmers whiz through the shallows, and bobbing fishing skiffs house smiling locals. Laid-back life mixed with the heady after-dark atmosphere of the half-Rasta beach bars of Tofo town make this all nearly irresistible for travelers in search of sun, sand, sea and relaxation. It&#8217;s no wonder the popular town on the coastal bends of Jangamo District is being touted by some as the next Goa! "
Quirimbas National Park,"The Quirimbas National Park is the great natural jewel of Cabo Delgado Province. It spills down from Mozambique&#8217;s northern mountain plateaux and into the waters of the Indian Ocean. Along the way there are great swathes of montane forests, savannah plains and endless mangroves, not to mention some sparkling coral reefs ringing the shoreline where the reserve extends into the sea. The unique duo of inland and coastal habitats makes Quirimbas a great place to come and spot the likes of African leopards, elephant herds, and crocs, all in the same day as seeing the large dugong and schools of multi-coloured fish from the tropics! "
Island of Mozambique,"Believe it or not, this tiny speck of land that languishes out in the shimmering waters of the Indian Ocean was once the very epicentre of Portuguese East Africa. Raised to greatness by the European traders and merchants that came its way around the cape, it became an important hub for commerce and admin during the 16th century. Consequently, there&#8217;s now a clutch of interesting colonial builds, like the old town fortifications, a charming whitewashed hospital and the Church of Santo António. Mozambique&#8217;s own character pops up too, with the thatched town of Makuti and the gorgeous tropical beaches. The whole place is now also a UNESCO World Heritage Site – not to be missed! "
Inhaca Island,"Facing the capital of Maputo across the waters of Maputo Bay, the small fragment of land that is Inhaca Island is a curious little treat, and a perfect choice for day trips to escape the heat of the city. Not too long ago (just seven millennia or so) it was actually a part of the East African mainland, while today it flounders out between its blooming gardens of corals. There are sloping beaches of yellow sand too, along with windy clusters of palm trees to wander. Remember though: Inhaca Island is truly undeveloped (thanks largely to its place as a marine research center), so it&#8217;s not the easiest of places to get to and explore. "
Ponta do Ouro,"Ponta do Ouro is a breath of fresh ocean air, located just 10 kilometers by road from the South Africa border and butting up neatly to the deep-blue Indian Ocean. A sleepy fishing town at heart, the place beats with the energy of some local tavernas and bamboo beach shacks. These draw a small but uber-friendly crowd of swimmers and snorkelers and surfers during the high season. However, Ponta do Ouro is also becoming famous for its most elegant marine creature: the dolphin. Excursions out to see the pods flipping and twisting through the waves out at sea are now one of the most popular activities! "
Vilankulo,"Vilankulo is worth a mention if only as the gateway to the aforementioned beauties of the Bazaruto Archipelago. But not only for that either, and if you come here to linger a little before hopping aboard one of the bobbing dhows that wait on the shore, then you&#8217;re in for a laid-back treat. Yep, this chilled seaside spot is also home to a clutch of its own campsites and leaning bamboo shacks, a lively local marketplace and beer bars. Add to that a smattering of deserted Indian Ocean beaches close to the town, where the horizon melds from golden yellow sand to cobalt-skies, and it&#8217;s easy to see why Vilankulo&#8217;s on the up! "
Lake Cahora Bassa,"The vast lake waters of Cahora Bassa extend all the way from the Zambia border to the very heart of Tete Province in western Mozambique. Covering a whopping 2,700 square kilometers in total, they represent one of the largest freshwater lake systems in all of Africa. At one end stands the colossal Cahora Bassa Dam – a massive wall of concrete and steel that clocks up 171 meters in height and 303 meters in width: definitely worth the journey if you like your breathtaking engineering projects! And all around the banks of the reservoir there are now interesting fishing lodges and a smattering of houseboats, not to mention the occasional baroque church in testimony to the erstwhile Portuguese presence. "
Niassa Reserve,"Thanks to a series of interconnected reserves that run from the meanders of the Ruvuma River in northern Mozambique all the way to the famous Selous Game Reserve of Tanaznia, the Niassa Reserve now plays a part in one of the largest international conservation areas on the planet. That also means that the vast area of miombo woods and rugged rock bluffs is home to some serious biodiversity, with the likes of the African lion, the African elephant and packs of wild dogs all roaming the breathtaking landscapes. A clutch of eco lodges and ethical tourism camps are now popping up here, attracting safari-goers eager to see the frontline of African preservation. "
Lugela,"Surrounded by swathes of spiny pine trees and firs, Lugela of the Zambezia highlands is hardly the sort of place you&#8217;d expect to find in the tropical reaches of East Africa. But that’s precisely the sort of climactic shock Mozambique is known for, and folks heading to this station under the great colossus of Mount Mabu can expect a unique experience of the country. Hiking and trekking through the savannah habitats are possible nearby, while the mist-topped reserves of the Mabu Forest (thought to be some of the largest remaining swathes of primeval highland forest in Africa) are home to some seriously weird and wonderful fauna: pygmy chameleons; rare bush vipers; critically-endangered birds. "
Limpopo National Park,"The Limpopo National Park has all the fascinating biodiversity and landscapes you&#8217;d expect of a protected reserve that&#8217;s contiguous with the legendary Kruger National Park of South Africa. Feathering out from the bends of the Limpopo River, it&#8217;s home to some of the most coveted of African game, which all now roams freely across the border thanks to some ahead-of-their-time international agreements on conservation. Safaris are – of course &#8211; the main draw and countless tourists come in to hit the grassy plains by 4X4 to seek out lions, elephants, waterbuck et al. "
Inhambane,"Long ago, Inhambane attracted traders form across the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Spices, silks and other exotic goods would drift into its wide bay on the southern reaches of modern day Mozambique, only to drift out again laden with coveted East African goods. Later, the bustling mercantile town and its favourable natural harbour became a favourite of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, and those who followed made sure that Inhambane flourished under colonial rule. That means there are plenty of charming baroque builds lining the streets, along with some great museums and a cemetery that could easily be plucked from the hills of Lisbon. Oh yea, and Tofo – that picture-perfect beach resort – is also nearby! "
Bagan,"Breathtaking Bagan bags a well-deserved top spot on this list of the best places to visit in Myanmar. The reason? Most all travelers who head this way leave with a distinct sense of awe and amazement. And it&#8217;s easy to see why! A sea of countless temple tops pierce the clouds and the forests; plumes of dust coalesce at the spires of ancient stupas; the faded outlines of forgotten Hindu demigods beckon from the great platforms, and all the while the serrated tips of the Arakan Mountains loom in the background. Seeing Bagan by balloon is becoming increasingly popular, and offers a truly unique view over this 26-square-mile land of temples. "
Shwedagon Pagoda,"Yangon found glory in the days of British rule, rising with the rise of the Raj and becoming a patchwork of elegant Victorian townhouses and Georgian builds. Much of that side of the city remains intact too, and today you can navigate the tuk-tuk-packed roadways to see the likes of St Mary&#8217;s Cathedral and its Anglo spires. However, the real piece de resistance (and what typically magnetizes travelers to this erstwhile Burmese capital) has to be the Shwedagon Pagoda. This marks the sacred spot where the holy lotus buds once appeared to signal the coming of Gautama Buddha and guide the learned to Nirvana. Be sure to visit the site and wonder and the glimmering gold construction, the prayer rooms, and the exquisitely carved pavilions for pilgrims. "
Kalaw,"Kalaw has risen and risen on the Myanmar tourist scene to become one of the favored destinations for trekkers and adventurers hitting the country&#8217;s eastern mountains. Perched high up on the ridges of the Shan hills, the spot began life as a mountain town under British rule, intended to offer a respite from the Asian heat of the plains below. Today, visitors can still enjoy the cooling breezes of the highlands, along with a clutch of laid-back guesthouses, excellent food markets, and – most importantly – hiking without the need for a permit! "
Shwenandaw Monastery,"You can only imagine just how resplendent the city of Mandalay would have looked when that mighty Shwenandaw Monastery glimmered with its coverings of gold leaf, and it&#8217;s easy to see why even the very name of this mysterious temple-topped town in the depths of central Myanmar has inspired poems and lines by perhaps Asia&#8217;s most prolific English eulogizer: Kipling. However, modern Mandalay does well to balance all those elegant Bamar pagodas and carved stupas with a real bout of Burmese pandemonium. This is, after all, the second-largest town in Myanmar, a pilgrimage site (thanks to the Maha Myat Muni Paya), and a famous tourist destination (known for its walled Royal Palace) all rolled into one! "
Golden Rock,"It&#8217;s just a short jaunt east from Yangon to the soaring heights of Mount Kyaiktiyo, which are famed as the home of one of the most revered Buddhist relics in the nation: the precariously-placed Golden Rock. This awesome, gravity-defying mass of granite can be found perched on its own ledge atop the rolling forests and green hills of south-central Burma. Legend has it that it&#8217;s suspended by a single thread of Buddha&#8217;s own hair, and (male) pilgrims come to scale the winding steps to the wonder to leave gold leaf and gain inspiration. The site is surrounded by its own temple and pagoda, complete with immersive little shrines to lesser-known Buddhist spirits. "
Inle Lake,"The moment you spot the curious leg rowers of Inle Lake, and hear the creaking splash of those carved canoes drifting across the water, you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re in the heartlands of rustic Myanmar. A place where time has stood still, this huge body of water is peppered with stilted villages made of wood. The locals are known for their on-surface agricultural methods, and you&#8217;ll be able to see dashes of green gardens growing straight from the lake. Major religious sites like the Hpaung Daw U Pagoda (which has an amazing festival in late-summer) also dot the banks, but the real draw has to be the food, which oozes fresh herbs, Chinese spices and lake-caught fish. "
Ngapali,"There&#8217;s no sand stretch in all of Myanmar as popular as Ngapali. A large curve of yellow-white that arches its way around the Bay of Bengal, it’s got a lapping ocean of turquoise waves and a fringing of huge palm trees. The occasional clutch of salt-washed fishing boats drift in and out of the bay during the day, feeding the kitchens with an endless supply of fresh seafood. There are oodles of loungers dotting the sands too, and plenty of tour organizers offering SCUBA expeditions, water skiing, jet skiing, sea kayaking and more. Ngapali also has its very own airport, making it one of the easier coastal spots to reach from the capital. "
Pindaya,"Pindaya is one of Myanmar&#8217;s more off-the-beaten-track religious sites. It makes its home in the rising Shan Hills of the eastern Myelat region, and offers a unique glimpse at the deep Buddhist histories of the nation. Formed from a series of deep caves, Pindaya is home to some 8,000 individual images of the Buddha, which can just be made out glimmering in gold and brass hues in the shadowy caverns. You can also wallow on the lakeside in the town of Pindaya, which enjoys a prime location between the peaks, and at the start of the popular cross-mountain trekking routes to Kalaw to boot. "
Hsipaw,"Prep the walking boots and thigh muscles for that trip to highland Hsipaw, because this onetime royal capital of the Shan peoples is slowly rising to compete with even aforementioned Kalaw on the trekking front. Don&#8217;t be surprised if you get caught up in these deep northern mountains longer than you thought – not only are the sweeping views of sun-scorched forests to die for, but there&#8217;s a rich cultural tradition to uncover too. You can experience this between the craft stalls of the town&#8217;s Central Market, or seek it out at the Shan Palace that still stands nostalgically atop the streets here. "
Mount Zwegabin,"Nestled between craggy, jungle-topped peaks and ringed by the reflective waters of the Thanlwin River, little Hpa-an is a rustic, rough-around-the-edges traveler town with some great hostels, guesthouses, and beer bars. Head down the bustling strip of Zaydan Road to flit between the coffee joints and spice-scented roadside kitchens, or make a beeline for the pretty lakeside of Kan Thar Yar, which shimmers like a mirror within walking distance of the center. And when it&#8217;s time to explore the karst peaks on the horizon, mysterious Mount Zwegabin and its hilltop monastery beckon. "
Mawlamyine,"A big city with a laid-back feel, Mawlamyine is a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of other Burmese metropolises like Yangon and Naypyidaw. It can be found deep in the territory of the Mon, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the border with Thailand, where it exudes a different sort of cultural character than many other places on this list. You&#8217;ll be able to climb to soaring pagodas like the Mahamuni Paya, which oozes Mon architectural twists, or you can see the high-perched Uzina Paya stupa, dressed in gold thanks to the offerings of countless pilgrims. Meanwhile, the town&#8217;s Central Market bustles with fruit and veg sellers, and there&#8217;s the opportunity to take a boat across to curiously-named Shampoo Island (home to some interesting Buddhist shrines, not hair products!). "
Mergui,"The many names of the Mergui Archipelago (this smattering of countless land masses in the Andaman Sea is also called Myeik Archipelago and the Pashu Islands) reflects the eclectic character of the various destinations it contains. Largely untrodden, the wealth of more than 800 islets here offers up everything from secluded sands that glow pearl-white under the Asian sun to wild mangroves stalked by macaques (look to the reserves of large Lampi Island for some of the best of those). Sailing is becoming big here too, and yachters flock to enjoy flitting between the uninhabited rocks and coves, salt-washed fishing villages and the settlements of sea nomads. "
Ngwe Saung,"Ngwe Saung might not have the tropical perfection of Ngapali, but thanks to a prime location on the edge of the Bay of Bengal, along with a clutch of pretty coconut groves and five-star resort hotels (check out how those sparkling infinity pools merge with the blues of the Indian Ocean!), it&#8217;s slowly rising to become another of Myanmar&#8217;s top beach destinations. Made for relaxation and rest, the long golden sands here are the prime attraction, of course. However, it&#8217;s also possible to sample fantastic Southeast Asian seafood – just look to the folksy restaurants that line up along the shore. "
Naypyidaw,"Naypyidaw is not like anything else in the country. Purpose-built and proclaimed the capital in a shock move by the then Burmese military leader Than Shwe back in 2005, it&#8217;s laid out in a rigid grid of imposing palaces and governmental buildings, nationalist monuments and grand constructions. Some see it as something of a hangover from the days when Burma was an iron-fist junta (even if that age is not completely vanished), others consider it a failed vanity project. But whatever the impetus of Naypyidaw, its ambitious parliament complexes and colossal golden Uppatasanti Pagoda are certainly worth seeing! "
Mrauk U,"Something of a more off-the-beaten-track alternative to much-trodden Bagan, Mrauk U can be found between the dust-caked hills of Rakhine State, located in the far western reaches of the country. It&#8217;s topped with countless stupas and temple spires, and offers an interesting glimpse of the age-old school of Arakanese religious building. It&#8217;s also thought that Mrauk U grew into a powerful merchant center in the late Middle Ages, with boats drifting across the Bay of Bengal from trading partners like India and Persia, and even Portugal and Europe! "
Etosha National Park,"If you can only stop by one of Namibia&#8217;s national parks, make it this one. Yes sir, Etosha has been famed for its wealth of rare animal life for more than 100 years – it was first proclaimed a game reserve way back in 1907! Today, the region, which encompasses dry and cracked salt pans and the labyrinthine valleys of the Leopard Hills (stalked by their eponymous beast, of course), is the safari kingpin of the country. Come and spy out the African bush elephants and plains zebras at the watering holes, get a glimpse of the uber-rare black rhino, or witness the springing springbok. "
Sossusvlei,"Set deep in the territories of the Namib-Naukluft National Park, where the scorching African sun beats down and sidewinder snakes drift over the undulations of sand, the salt pan known as Sossusvlei is the Namibia of travel brochures. Beset by huge, hulking dunes – some of the highest in the world, in fact – it&#8217;s a place that rarely fails to take the breath away. These great sculpted sections of desert shift in the winds, and some parts – like the colossal mound of Dune 7 – clock up whopping heights of more than 350 meters above sea level. 4X4 tours are the most popular way to see the sights, and visitors can expect to spy out the likes of antelope and oryx, springbok and ostrich as they delve into the wilds. "
Himba woman in Kaokoland,"There are few places in all of Africa like the carved lands of Kaokoland. Bisected by winding river ways that meander like desert snakes through the rock-ribbed mountains and the great Grand Canyon-mimicking escarpments of the north, the region is remote and untouched. Today though, it&#8217;s slowly becoming more open to tourists, who flock in after safaris in nearby Etosha. They mainly come to encounter the perennially-smiling Himba folk, who&#8217;ve scraped a living from the wilderness here as nomads for centuries. Kaokoland is also the home to the fascinating mountain elephant; specially adapted for life with little water. "
Swakopmund,"Between the Saxon half-timbered facades that line the exterior of the Altes Gefängnis jail, the ochre-hued Woermannhaus and the other clutch of indelibly European architecture that peppers the downtown of this beachside resort on the Atlantic coast of Namibia, it’s easy to see and feel the German influence. And it doesn&#8217;t end there, because beer halls and hops-scented pubs all spill onto the wide sands of the Swakopmund beach (one fringed with a lovely, lively promenade), and there are even dubious Nazi trinkets and lederhosen aike still available in the craft markets. Weird. "
Skeleton Coast Park,"There are few landscapes that define the wilds of Namibia as well as the Skeleton Coast Park. This great stretch of endless sand dunes and crashing Atlantic waves runs for no less than 500 kilometers from top to bottom. It&#8217;s delineated by the spot where the arid deserts of the inland meet the ocean, and famed as one of the most dangerous sections of shoreline in the world. There are countless rusting carcasses of old tankers and skiffs, fishing boats and convoy ships to testify to this. Tales of perished sailors still abound too, making this very much the domain of the wandering Namid elephant and the stalking hyena – not humans. "
Windhoek,"Windhoek is an interesting little place that is something of a capsule of Namibia as a whole. Sat virtually smack bang in the heart of the country, the city started life as a small pastoral settlement, known for its babbling freshwater spring. Today, that water table keeps the interior of the town – from palm-dotted Zoo Park to manicured Parliament Garden – nice and green. There are Bavarian-style towers belying the old German influence too, along with a series of typically Swabian beer bars that make for a surprisingly good nightlife. Then there&#8217;s the rougher side, where the trials of Namibian life come into focus: Katutura, the endless barrio; Okuryangava and its tin-shack homes. "
Twyfelfontein,"Twyfelfontein isn&#8217;t known for its fascinating wealth of wildlife, or for any buzzing metropolitan character – in fact, it isn&#8217;t really even a town at all. Instead, this spot in the midst the dusty Kunene Region in the very heart of northern Namibia is famed as the home of some of Africa&#8217;s most prolific displays of ancient rock art. Tagged – unsurprisingly – by UNESCO back in 2007, it&#8217;s thought that the spot has be inhabited for as many as six millennia. It&#8217;s spread over a series of more than 16 individual sites, each exhibiting their own curious anthropomorphic petroglyphs. What&#8217;s more, the area itself rarely fails to take the breath away; what with its patchwork of soaring table mountains and rolling savannah plains. "
Namib-Naukluft National Park,"Already mentioned on this list as the area containing the iconic dunes and salt flats of Sossusvlei, the seemingly endless sea of sand that is the Namib-Naukluft National Park is certainly worth a second mention on account of the wealth of other bucket-list-busting must-sees that exist between its boundaries. Take Deadvlei; a cracked and withered landscape of sun-scorched acacia trees (some thought to be as much as 700 years old!) and mud flats. And then, closer to the beaches and the town of Swakopmund, the landscapes become truly otherworldly, as the parched plains rise to ridgebacks that resemble the maned spine of a stalking hyena! "
Spitzkoppe,"The Spitzkoppe is one of the most captivating sights of the Damaraland and of Namibia&#8217;s backcountry as a whole. When it was encountered for the first time by German troops back in the early 1900s, comparisons were immediately drawn with the chiseled summits of Switzerland&#8217;s Matterhorn. It&#8217;s clear to see why, with that twisted and contorted mass of granite stone soaring more than 1,700 meters above the rolling desert plains. Ancient rock paintings also crowd around the base of the mountain, there&#8217;s a great campsite here, and oodles of carved rock formations – arches, caves, bridges – to wonder at. "
Caprivi,"Caprivi, or more appropriately the Caprivi Strip, is a long, thin needle of land that pokes its way into the heart of west southern Africa from the northern reaches of Namibia. Almost half the length of Namibia proper, it&#8217;s home to habitats and climactic zones simply not found elsewhere in the country, and plays an important role as a connecting bridge for rare wildlife migrating inland and towards the coast; creatures like the Namibian elephant and the African wild dog. After a civil war in the 1990s, the area is now returning to focus on its unique flora and fauna, which includes zebras in the Mahango Game Reserve, blue wildebeest in Bwabwata, and verdant savannah in Salambala Conservancy. "
Kolmanskop,"The famed ghost town of Namibia is an eerie and haunting place. Since the whole place was abandoned in the middle of the 20th century, the homes have slowly crumbled and the various municipal buildings have dilapidated. It was not always the case: Kolmanskop was once one of the richest towns in the country; famed for its diamond boom – they say the sparkling jewels were just lying on the ground here in the 1900s! At its height, the spot had its very own school, fire station and ice factory. Today though, its empty shell is visited by hundreds of tourists a year, who come to see the abandoned way of life and snap photos of the spooky emptiness. "
Walvis Bay,"Thanks to its tactical position on the Atlantic coast, with access to one of the finest deep water harbors this side of the Cape of Good Hope, Walvis Bay has been a plaything for the historic superpowers in the African theater of war. The Portuguese passed this way, then the Brits, then came the Germans in the First World War, each raising evermore elaborate dock structures and depots. Now, with the colonial conflicts long in the past, the city is one of the top tourist draws in all of Namibia. It&#8217;s got kitesurfing along its beaches, oodles of fishing opportunities, tour organizers touting excursions to the bird-rich islands out at sea, and sand boarding on the dunes of the Namib Desert. "
Penguin Islands,"Following neatly on from Walvis Bay, this smattering of rocks and tiny islets that poke above the Atlantic close to the spot of coast where the erstwhile German harbor town can be found is another top draw for travelers in the region. As the name suggests, they are occasionally dotted with colonies of the country&#8217;s trademark Jackass Penguin (an unfortunate name, we know!). However, those flat-footed waddlers aren&#8217;t the only draw. There are breathtaking headlands and cliffs to see, along with a whole host of other unusual avian and sea life. "
Fish River Canyon,"The Fish River Canyon winds and weaves between the great mountains of southern Africa in truly majestic fashion. Red-hued rocks tower atop the valley bottom, pits of deep sand and colossal boulders spot the landscape, and the sunsets glow blood-red against the rugged ranges known as the Three Sisters. For intrepid travelers, the hiking path that runs the length of this great wonder can hardly be resisted. It crosses high passes and arduous tracts of dusty lands, covering a mega 88 kilometers from start to finish. "
Hentiesbaai,"The gateway to the National West Coast Recreation Area is one of Namibia&#8217;s most popular high-season tourist draws for domestic travelers. Oodles of folk leave behind the city streets of Windhoek and head to the wind-blasted shoreline here. They come to ride rumbling 4X4s over the undulating desert dunes, to break out into the inhospitable wildernesses of the Skeleton Coast, and to see the thousands of seals that pepper the beach banks to the north of town. The town is also known for its diversity of marine life, which draws anglers and boaters to boot. "
Brownville Village Theatre,"Founded in 1854, this tiny town of Brownville is a historical gem with so much to offer despite its small size. Travelers will love perusing the museums, boutique shops, bookstores, folk art galleries, and even stay in a floating bed and breakfast accommodation on the river. Brownville also has a plethora of a walking and biking trail, arboretum, and a 100-year-old barn surrounded by vineyards. In the evenings, tourists can also go to Brownville Village Theatre, a delightful venue with talented live performers of all types. And if there’s nothing going on there, you can also head to the Brownville Concert Hall, a happening place renowned for featuring Bluegrass artists. "
Carnegie Library,"McCook is a well-rounded small town in Southwest Nebraska known for its friendly locals, historical sites, and well-maintained public parks. Surrounding the area are four main prairie lakes, a clear river, and manicured walking trails that are perfect for bird watching, exploring, and swimming. McCook takes pride in showing all who come by the highlights of the Midwest lifestyle. The local farms offer hands-on experiences of produce picking, cattle cutting, and a look at how the pilgrims once lived. Other top sites include the Frank Lloyd Wright’s Sutton House, Senator George W. Norris State Historical Site, and the Museum of the High Plains and Carnegie Library. "
Rowe Sanctuary,"You can easily spend more than a weekend in Minden, a small-town chock full of museums, natural parks, and lively community events. Just outside the town center of Minden, you can head to Rowe Sanctuary, a wildlife haven with thousands of Sand Hill Cranes and other migratory birdlife. Minden is also home to Pioneer Village, a village made up of over 28 buildings where you have an intimate look at the exciting pioneer times. There are over 50,000 historical items, making it the largest private Americana collection in the world. You can easily spend a day checking out the steam carousel, flying machines, Jackson paintings, antique tractors, and even a 1903 Ford! "
Egerton Explorit Center,"Aurora is a small town with a little under 4,500 residents with many historical, natural, and architectural sites. It’s a great stop for travelers wanting to experience a typical small town lifestyle but still explore some interesting highlights. There is also the Egerton Explorit Center, an interactive learning and science center that’s perfect for visitors of all ages. Many guests state that this center rivals those usually found in big cities, despite being in a small town! For a small dose of history, check out the Plainsman Museum, where you can learn all about history of the everyday people who worked and lived in the Hamilton County region. Some interesting sights include a covered wagon, replica barbershops, toy stores, and jail, and an entire floor that highlights the region’s agricultural importance. "
the Wildlife Safari Park,"A mix of modern and antique, Ashland is a small town that does an incredible job of straddling the eras of then and now. It’s a great home base for exploring the nearby sites of the Mahoney State Park, the Wildlife Safari Park, and a handful of golf courses. The town itself offers a quaint shopping area where you can easily find unique objects for a friend or for yourself. The Strategic Air and Space Museum in Ashland is also a top site, where you can look at authentic space and air machinery, learn about black holes, and the legacy EC-135 restored aircraft. "
The Chadron State Park,"Love wide open spaces? Then you’re sure to love Chadron, a small town surrounded by incredible plains and trees– perfect for spotting wildlife. The Chadron State Park and the Pine Ridge National Recreation Areas have clean campgrounds, hiking trails, and pristine bodies of water. The museum curators paid an incredible amount of detail to the fur trade history, mapping routes and collecting artifacts that span earlier than 1776. Other cultural sites include the Chadron Arts Center, where you can view live performances and artwork from local artists. There is also the Mari Sandoz Heritage Center and the Dawes County Historical Museum for travelers addicted to learning all about the areas that they explore. "
Lake McConaughy,"Ogallala is an interesting small town whose historic front street looks just like you’ve stepped back into the days of the wild west. There are tens of area attractions both manmade and natural. If you’re interested in architecture, the Little Catholic-Protestant Church at Keystone and the Haythorn Ranch houses are must-sees. At Lake McConaughy and Lake Ogallala, you can picnic and search for hundreds of bird species that call the shores of these lakes their home. Ogallala makes a great base for seeing the Ash Hollow State Historical Park, a site where you can discover history about the regional geology, paleontology, ancient Native American life, fur trappers, and more. "
Willa Cather,"With a population of just a tad over 1,000 residents, Red Cloud is a cute small town that was once the hometown of Willa Cather, one of America’s greatest Pulitzer prize winning writers. Willa Cather often depicted life on the great plains and brought not only great interest to the region but also highlighted the issues that were unique to the area. Since she was such a notable figure, Red Cloud established the Willa Cather Foundation that offers a tour through seven important buildings. There is also the Willa Cather Memorial Prairie, a beautiful wide space that inspired many of Willa Cather’s novels. "

Visitors still flock to Madrid because it’s a main stop on the Turquoise Trail, a scenic trail on Highway 14 that passes through the state’s best turquoise mining areas.  Even if you’re just passing through, you’d be silly to miss ordering a green chili burger from the Mine Shaft Tavern, the town’s most popular watering hole. There are so many galleries and art shops to visit while in Madrid. Some favorites include Trading Bird, Indigo Gallery, and the Starshine Gallery, where you’re likely to grab a great deal on Turquoise handcrafted jewelry. For shoppers, there are also other antique shops and boutique clothing shops where you can find items not found anywhere else. "
Mesilla,"In the past 100 years, not much has changed architecturally in Mesilla. The plaza and village is just as beautiful as ever, and it’s easy to imagine yesteryear to the days when Billy the Kid ruled the roost. The Mesilla Plaza is even a National Historic Landmark because of its significance. Locals mark their hospitality by decorating their homes and businesses with ristras, red chile strung together. It’s best to visit Mesilla during a cultural event, of which there are many throughout the year. Some crowd favorites include Cinco de Mayo, Dis de Los Muertos, Mariachi Festivals, Jazz Concerts, or even Christmas Eve, when the town lights up hundreds of luminarias. "
Ruidoso,"This mountain town is set among over a million acres of natural beauty. Everywhere you look there are national forests, hiking and mountain biking trails, lakes, streams, and so many trees. If you visit in winter, you can easily escape to Ski Apache ski resord. Needless to say, it’s the perfect stop for travelers obsessed with outdoor adventures. In town, Ruidoso has a thriving art scene that especially focuses on Native American styled jewelry and displays. There are also a variety of restaurants, boutique shops, and historical sites. However, when in Ruidoso, it’s best to copy the lifestyle of the locals and spend your time relaxing amidst the beauty of nature. Two words ring true here: Don’t rush. "
skiing,"No matter the season, Red River is a must-see destination for anyone visiting New Mexico, as there’s no shortage of things to do. Though Red River used to be a rough and tumble town complete with brothels, bar fights, and outlaws, it’s taken on a much tamer reputation today. There are constant community events throughout the year to look out for. Thrill seekers can use Red River as a base for zip-lining, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, snow shoeing, and so much more. There are a variety of cozy cabins to rent and warm up at during the winter months – or to relax at when the weather is warm. If you get too overwhelmed by all of the activities on offer, simply check into one of the town’s handful of spas for a massage and a mud wrap. "
Pie-o-neer Pie café,"Get ready for puns in Pie Town, where you can eat pies at the Pie-o-neer Pie café where all your dreams might just be a pie in the sky. In fact, this small town was indeed named after a café that served incredible apple pies in the early 1900s, though some locals claim it got its name from being “3.14 miles from nowhere.” This makes a great resting point if you’re traveling through the Continental Divide Trail where you can grab a thick slice of world-class pie. One famous slice is the Mexican Apple Pie from Good Pie Café, where their classic apple comes with locally grown green chile and pinon. Many people come to Pie Town not only for the pie but also for the sheer remoteness of it. Many artists find it liberating to be in a true pioneer town with enough wide-open spaces to let their creativity flow freely. "
Belen Harvey House Museum,"The citizens of Belen have always been self-sufficient. The town started from forty families who made Belen into what it is today – a thriving community with a variety of hotels, restaurants, historic sites, and citizens who love the Rio Grande Valley. While in Belen, be sure to visit the Belen Harvey House Museum, a historical structure perfect for photos and exploring. This small town also makes a great resting point for long-distance travelers, as it’s just a short way away from the I-25 and I-40. "
Clayton,"Clayton is known as the Town of Enchantment by those who visit with an exciting history that stems from the Dust Bowl days, when Americans moved to Clayton, New Mexico, in search of a more fulfilling life. It was the first town on the Santa Fe Trail that sprung up after a railroad was developed from Kansas. Now, you can experience Native American culture, visit the stunning views of the Rabbit Ear Mountains, and more. "
lighthouse,"Byron Bay is a true Australian icon: this lovely little town was a major hippie &amp; alternative centre in the 60s, and the culture still leaves its mark (you’ll even still see hippies milling around!) It’s become a popular spot with tourists from Sydney and further afield to take a relaxing break with their families, and to enjoy the friendly atmosphere of the town. There’s a gorgeous beach and adorably quirky boutique shopping. You can also visit Australia’s most powerful lighthouse, which is still active and is great for a postcard-perfect view of the town (and for a lighthouse selfie!) You can also take a quick detour to Tropical Fruit World, where you can try all sorts of exotic delights and bush-tucker fruits. Finger limes are particularly delicious, as are black sapotes (popularly known as the chocolate pudding fruit!) "
Snowy Mountains,"Colloquially known as “the Snowies”, this mountain range is the highest in Australia, and contains Mount Kosciuszko which towers at 2,228 metres over sea level. The mountains experience large amounts of snow every winter, and are great for skiing and snow sports, but they’re just as much of a delight in summer: you can enjoy fishing for salmon or trout, hiking through pristine mountain wilderness, or cave exploring. (Also, enjoying a local brew and taking in the atmosphere of a true-blue Aussie pub!) The local flora and fauna is also a treat; many rare species can be found in the mountains, and if you’re lucky you might spot a mountain pygmy possum or a dusky antechinus. "
Mungo National Park,"Mungo National Park is a true Aussie outback experience. The barren landscape is starkly beautiful, formed on a chain of dried-up riverbeds and sand dunes. It’s also famous for its insight into the beginning of human life, as it is one of the oldest places outside of Africa to be continuously populated, for 50,000 years. The oldest skeleton in Australia (Mungo Man) was found here, as was the earliest example of ritual cremation (Mungo Woman). You can take a tour guided by an indigenous ranger for a special understanding of the significance of the area in local Aboriginal culture, and even stay overnight in an old shearer’s quarters. "
Nimbin,"Just over an hour away from Byron Bay, Nimbin can best be described as Byron’s less-known (and therefore less-commercialized!) soulmate: when housing got more expensive in Byron Bay, much of the hippie community moved here. Since its inland, there’s no beach to enjoy, but the alternative lifestyle is much more pronounced here, and many visitors to Byron Bay will make the short trip here as well to see a taste of Byron Bay-of-yore. With its colourful streetscape, and its yearly Mardi Grass (yes, grass, not gras!) festival, Nimbin has become the Australian capital of the alternative lifestyle, the hippie movement and environmentalism. Strike up a chat with some locals – the best thing about Nimbin is its people! – and enjoy this truly unique town. "
Jervis Bay,"Jervis Bay is famous for having the world’s whitest sand beach (as per the Guinness Book of Records!), Hymas Beach. This charming, quaint collection of small towns is great for nature-lovers, surfers, divers and holiday-makers. The Aboriginal history of this town goes back thousands of years, and since the area isn’t heavily touristed, you can enjoy the experience of having this treasure of unspoiled Australian nature mostly to yourself. "
Port Stephens,"With over 140 bottlenose dolphins, this is a great place for dolphin-watching, or even swimming with the dolphins! It’s also a popular spot for surfing, bushwalking, horse (and camel!) riding, and bicycling. Port Stephens is the home of the Great Lakes Marine Parks, where you can encounter a wide variety of marine species: from humpback whales to sponge gardens! "
Newcastle,"These three sites are a stone’s throw away from each other, and there’s enough here to keep you busy for a few days. The Hunter Valley is known in Australia and beyond for its fantastic wineries, and gourmet cheeses, olives and olive oil. Newcastle is also known for its culinary delights, as well as a vibrant handmade, bespoke shopping culture that is reminiscent of a real-life Etsy! Newcastle also boasts gorgeous beaches, and a great café and bar culture. At nearby Lake Macquarie, you can take a stroll of its clear-blue, stunning namesake lake, or enjoy a coastal bushwalk or mountain hike. It is also known for its sailing, cruising and kayaking, as well as a vibrant artistic scene. "
Taronga Zoo,"These sister zoos are some of Australia’s most popular. Taronga Zoo is a short, enjoyable ferry ride from Sydney’s city centre. The Western Plains Zoo, also known as Dubbo Zoo, is also well-worth a look if you’re in the area. Taronga Zoo boasts a gorgeous view of the river, and 2,600 animals of 340 species. The Western Plains zoo boasts free-ranging peacocks, pelicans and black swans, as well as many Australian native animals (it’s a great place to see a Tasmanian devil, a wallaby or a kangaroo!) and species from further afield. The grounds of both zoos are immaculate, the animals are well-kept, and if you’ve got time, they’re different enough that you’ll enjoy both! "
Bondi Beach,"This iconic Sydney beach is perhaps Australia’s most well-known internationally. It’s always very busy, but the vibrant atmosphere is part of the fun, and it’s also the place to spot celebrities – both local and international! Its one of Australia’s most touristed sites, and has been added to the Australian National Heritage List. (Another Aussie world record: it’s also the site of the largest swimsuit photo shoot, with 1,010 bikini-clad participants!) The surrounding suburb, also called Bondi Beach, has many popular eateries and boutiques, as well as Bondi Pavilion, a community cultural centre. "
Darling Harbour,"Darling Harbour is perhaps the best-known tourist site in Sydney, and the home of the Sydney Opera House. There’s plenty to see, do and shop for here, and the Paddington Markets and Chinatown are a short walk away, making this area a great place to while away a day. Some of the highlights of Darling Harbour are the serene Chinese Garden of Friendship (with a lovely tea shop), the nightlife at King Street Wharf, Sydney Aquarium and Zoo, and the world’s largest cinema screen. There’s also always of plenty of events going on, so check out DarlingHarbour.com for the latest information. "
Powerhouse Museum,"This is considered one of the best museums in Australia, with an excellent collection of interesting exhibits that’s fun for all ages. The museum building is a converted powerhouse, and the exhibits largely focus on technology-related themes, such as science, communication and space technology. The museum’s collection consists of over 400 thousand artifacts, and exhibits change regularly, so it’s worth visiting again if you’re in Sydney a second time. "
Northern Beaches,"Manly is a quaint beach-resort suburb a short ferry away from Sydney city centre. You can enjoy an ice cream or fish and chips on the beach, or go on a nature or heritage walk– there’s 100km of trails in the area. Northern Beaches extends from Manly to Palm Beach (just under 40km north), and is known for its breathtaking natural beauty and lovely coastal towns. The area attracts 8 million visitors per year, and it’s a must-do for visitors to Sydney. "
South West Rocks,"South West Rocks is a beautiful small town surrounded by lush greenery, on the Mid North Coast of NSW. The beautiful beach is nestled among towering pines, and the town is not far from one of the world’s best cave dives, Fish Rock Cave, or from Smoky Cape Lighthouse, which is a great whale-watching spot. The nearby rainforest is home to wallabies and swallow-tailed butterflies, and the ruins of Trail Bay Gaol (opened in 1886) is a heritage site which forms an interesting insight into the convict history of Australia. "
Blue Mountains,"Named after the blue haze that can often be seen on the horizon, the Blue Mountains are a UNESCO World Heritage site, and a must-see on the itinerary of international and local tourists alike. The dramatic scenery of the rugged mountains and the deep gorges (up to 760 metres!) make it a fascinating example of Australian geology and nature. The Three Sisters sandstone rock formation is perhaps the best-known Blue Mountains attraction. It’s also an interesting example of historic indigenous inhabitation: the Kings Tableland Aboriginal Site dates back 22,000 years. This area is also great for spotting exotic Australian animals: 400 different species, some of which are rare, can be found here. There’s plenty of tourist attractions to be found here, both man-made and natural, but a particularly gorgeous site is the Jenolan Caves, a network of fossil-rich limestone caves with beautiful calcite formations. "
Budderoo National Park,"Located on the NSW South Coast, this national park boasts beautiful lush scenery and stunning waterfalls. Just over 100km from Sydney, Budderoo is an ideal place to get away from the inner-city hustle and bustle. The park is great for bushwalking, birdwatching, or even a picnic. The award-winning Minnamura Rainforest Centre, the Jamberoo Lookout and the Nellies Glen picnic areas are particularly charming, and there’s plenty of photo opportunities to keep your Snapchat busy. "
Cold Spring &#8211; New York,"With a population around 2,000, and a spot on the National Register of Historic Places, Cold Spring is a popular spot for a weekend city escape. Many of the buildings in the downtown area are from the 19th century and locals pride themselves that most of the shops are independently owned. If you like rambling around with no particular place to go, Cold Spring offers charm, quiet, and comfort. If you want a little outdoor adventure, the Hudson River passes by and boating and kayaking are offered. You can also try golfing, biking, or hiking here. Be sure to visit the historic West Point Foundry, and Moo Moo’s Creamery. "
Waterfront Italianate Inn in Aurora,"When we say small, we mean Aurora. Also known as Aurora-On-Cayuga, the population is less than 1,000 residents. Most known for Wells College, originally for women only, the combined village and college historic district is made up of about 50 homes and buildings. Beginning in 2001, Pleasant Rowland, a Wells College alum and founder of the American Girl historic dolls and books series, began an effort to revitalize the town. Today, it’s an ideal spot to feel as if you’re deep in the country and far away from the cares of the world. "
Winter Trees Near Cayuga Lake,"The cultural attractions in Ithaca are some of the best in New York. Unique and fabulous restaurants, incredible art galleries, and amazing live music events are just the start. It’s also well known for its breath-taking natural beauty. Visitors love to let themselves get lost in the gorges surrounding the shores of Cayuga Lake. Check out the 28,000 acres of state forest, and discover over 150 waterfalls that make this area so beautiful. Ithaca is home to Cornell University, and as a university town, it has a lively and energetic atmosphere. "
Raquette Lake,"For those looking for a camping holiday, Raquette Lake is the place. The town, located on the west side of the lake, is right in the middle of stunning wilderness. The pace in town is slow and with 99 miles of shoreline, you’ll love exploring the largest natural lake in the Adirondack Mountains. The state of New York declared the area ‘Forever Wild’ and the wonderful scenery and fun outdoor adventure make Raquette Lake a great vacation spot. Trying hiking, camping, fishing, boating, and more. Be sure to visit Pine Knot, Uncas, and Sagamore to experience the luxurious and rustic estates in town. "
"Cooperstown, NY","Most American’s can tell you that the Baseball Hall of Fame is in Cooperstown, New York. But it’s so much more than that. With no chain stores, plenty of outdoor recreation, and incredible culture, this small town delivers big. Most visitors stop at the hall of fame first, and then make their way to The Fenimore Art Museum, which showcases 20th century American art as well as American Indian pieces. There’s also The Famer’s Museum where you can step back in time and experience life on the Lippitt Farmstead. People of all ages love the historic village. Brewery Ommegana is a favourite spot for unique craft brews, and The Glimmerglass Festival, held each summer, showcases opera on the lake. "
"Lake Placid, NY","Founded in 1900, Lake Placid lies in the Adirondack Mountains and was listed as one of the ‘Six Forgotten Vacation Spots of North America’ by U.S. News &amp; World Report. Most famous as the host of the Winter Olympics in both 1932 and 1980, and holds a special place in America’s heart and the site of the ‘Miracle on Ice,’ when US men’s hockey won gold against the USSR.  You can see New York’s highest peak, Mt. Marcy, and enjoy skiing on other great slopes like the Olympic Mountain, Whiteface, and more. Visitors love hiking, cross-country skiing, ice-climbing, canoeing, swimming, and snowmobiling. The many resorts in town feature fantastic dining and every season brings a fantastic festival to town. "
Chittenango,"If you love the Wizard of Oz, you’ll love Chittenango. It’s the birthplace of L. Frank Baum, the books author, and locals are very proud of their native son. Chittenango is a village within the town of Sullivan, and its population is less than 6,000.  Each summer there’s a three-day festival called Oz-Stravaganza to celebrate the author and the book. There’s a parade and many community groups perform. "
New Paltz,"New Paltz is a college town, and because of that, there’s always plenty to do. Between the student population, an amazingly moderate year round climate, it’s close proximity to both New York City and Albany, and the historic district, New Paltz has become an energetic cultural centre of the state. In the 17th century, 12 Huguenots settled on 40,000 acres near Wallkill River. They and their descendants built what is now the Huguenot Street Historic District – which is listed on the National Historic Registry. It’s no surprise why the original settlers stopped here – some of the most amazing views of the Hudson are found in New Paltz. Enjoy fine dining, boutique shops, fabulous wine, and a vibrant local scene. "
Greenport,"Named by Forbes as one of the prettiest towns in the US (2011), and once a fishing village, Greenport is now better known for vineyards. The population here is right around 2,000 and the combination of wine and fresh catch make Greenport a hot spot of fine dining. Mentioned as one of the Top 10 Wine Destinations in the USA, the town can’t forget it’s fishing roots. Once a major whaling port in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was also an oystering centre for many decades. History has it that Walt Whitman taught a semester of high school English here! "
Saratoga Springs,"Just north of Albany is Saratoga Springs, ranked by New Yorkers as one of the best places to live in the state. Founded in the 17th century by English colonists, the area played a crucial role in the American Revolution. The town is now known for horse racing and culture. It’s the home for both the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York City Ballet summer residencies. Over the course of its 200-year history, many visitors have come to dip in the famous mineral springs that gave the town its name. "
Pawling,"You’ll find Pawling in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. If you want to spend some time exploring nature, this is your place. With access to the Appalachian Trail and the Pawling Preserve, many weekend trail warriors end up here. Locals pride themselves on their volunteerism, and there’s an atmosphere of abundance and generosity here. Pawling is charming and outdoorsy and a real oasis from city life. "
"Geneva, NY","The largest of the Finger Lakes is Seneca, and the most popular town on Seneca Lake is Geneva. Part of the growing New York wine country scene, Geneva is the heart of this thriving region. The town fashions itself as ‘uniquely urban,’ by which they mean that it definitely feels like a small town, the kind of place where everyone says hello, but there is so much diversity that you’ll feel like you’re in the city. There are plenty of options when it comes to food, art, film, shopping, and learning, to keep you coming back again and again. "
Skaneateles Mansion,"If you’re an avid B&amp;B-er, you might want to consider a visit to Skaneateles (pronounced ‘skinny-atlas’).  With a historic downtown, charming inns, and wonderful restaurants, this small town is a popular stop for tourists. The historic district dates back to the 18th century and makes up the modern commercial centre of town. It sits right on the lake and has three lakeside parks for hiking and picnics. In the summer you can join the towns 7,000 residents in attending the Skaneateles music festival and the Antique and Classic Boat Show. Each winter the town does a Dickens Christmas, which actors performing in the streets in period dress. "
"Westfield, NY","On the shores of Lake Erie, you’ll find the town of Westfield. Another wine country favourite, it’s also a major producer of Concord Grape Juice. This is a great summer stop as you can enjoy fishing, sailing, and golfing, along with music festivals, galleries, and theatre. The number of wineries offering tastings will leave you dizzy just thinking about them!  Visit nearby Barcelona Harbor for rolling green hills and a beach that’s perfect for swimming! "
Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow,"This town holds a special place in American folklore. Sleepy Hollow was made legendary by Washington Irving’s tale of the same name. Thanks to the popularity of the story, the town has maintained much of its history and small town charm. Although some like to visit because of its reputation as the most haunted place in the world! While there, be sure to visit the Old Dutch Church, Philipsburg Manor House, and the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery – where Elizabeth Arden, Brooke Astor, and Andrew Carnegie are buried. "
Zinder,"A maze of tight-knit lanes and hidden streets weaves and winds to form the hard-to-navigate heart of Zinder. Meanwhile, the Sultan&#8217;s Palace towers over the town with its great adobe architectural achievements. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the bustling bazaar, which stretches as far as the eye can see – it&#8217;s easy to believe it was once one of the busiest camel caravan stops on the trans-Saharan route! Yep, Zinder comes top for many reasons: its rich history of French rule, tribal culture and trading; its mercantile energy; its sheer, raw African beauty. In short: not to be missed. "
Niamey,"More than 1.3 million people live, work and play in the capital city of Niamey, making it the veritable human heart of Niger. The city straddles the courses of the Niger River in the south-west, and bustles with fantastic open air markets, and a surprisingly heady nightlife scene after dark (check out the beer joints around Yantala Ancien – and remember the strict drinking laws as you do!). International eateries touting pizzas and pastas mix with the spicy creations of the African kitchen too, while the bulbous blue domes of the Grand Mosque are simply not to be missed! "
Agadez,"Boasting nearly 1,000 years of history and steeped in tales of Sahelian camel caravans, the Ottomans (believe it or not!), and the old Songhai imperialists, enthralling Agadez certainly has a story to tell. The town is found smack bang in the heart of the country as a whole, surrounded by the sun-scorched dunes of the Sahara Desert and the endless yellow of the sand sea. It&#8217;s formed from a grid of narrow streets and adobe, mud-brick homes. The centerpiece has to be the earthen minaret of the central mosque, which mimics the great landmarks of the desert towns of Mali to the west. "
W National Park,"Unquestionably the most famous national park in all of Niger, the W National Park has also attained that coveted UNESCO World Heritage Site tag, which it was awarded on account of its unique display of transition habitats between the savannah and the West African woods. Just one fragment of the huge W Transborder Park that crosses into Burkina Faso and Benin, it&#8217;s made up primarily of dusty bushland. And the animals? Well, suffice to say you should get the camera ready for a medley of baboons and African buffalo, giraffes, leopards, lions and more! "
Ayorou,"After just three hours on the rumbling dust roads from the capital you could find yourself alighting in the charming river town of Ayorou, one of the top draws of Southwestern Niger. Known for the surrounding riparian habitats that encompass the settlement, Ayorou itself sits on its very own island, where the mosque and marketplaces both make their home too. In fact, the bazaar is a great place to start your travels here, searching through the curious folk remedies and sampling simple Sahel street food, all before breaking out to see the hippos splashing and lazing in the muddy waters nearby. "
Nguigmi,"The gateway to the aforementioned Abaaba National Park and the easternmost settlement in the whole of Niger, the town of Nguigmi buts up the banks of cross-border Lake Chad with its humble air strip and pretty city mosque. The whole place oozes the character you&#8217;d expect of a far-flung desert town, with camel caravans coming and going every day of the year. The small settlement is also home to the tribal groups of the Kanuri people, the Daza and the Wodaabe-Fulani – many of whom are some of the few remaining examples of Niger&#8217;s fascinating pastoral communities. "
Maradi,"For most travelers, Maradi – the third-largest city in the whole country – will be just an administrative stop; to switch transports or stock up before heading out to the historic richness of Zinder, or to the Nigerian border to the south. However, those who linger will discover a town that hardly feels like any other urban destination in the nation; a place of (relative) economic prosperity and buzzing markets, oozing confidence and panache. Head down to the Grand Marché to haggle your way through shamanic jewelry and magic charms like lizard tails and the like. There&#8217;s also the awesome palatial home of the tribal leader: the Maradi palace, rising in grand styles on one of the central squares. "
Tahoua,"Traditionally the place where the Tuareg tribes of the northern desert lands fused with the Fulani folk of the southern reaches of the country, the town of Tahoua is where two of the major cultural identities in Niger can be seen mingling, mixing, and – most importantly of all – trading their wares. The market here really does take center stage, so be sure to head down and see its buzzing stalls and the endless wealth of carved totems and witch doctor&#8217;s trinkets there. The place is also known as one of the country&#8217;s phosphate mining hubs – so don&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a clutch of unattractive industry too. "
Timia,"Bulbous pink pomegranates, blood-red and orange citrus fruits, and bountiful clusters of watermelons are might not what you&#8217;d expect to see this deep in the heart of the Sahara Desert, but the far-flung town of Timia tells a different story. Fed by an oasis for the entire year, the little clusters of low-rise cottages is surrounded by verdant fields of orchards and agricultural ground. They stretch along the length of the valleys that carve through the heart of the Air Mountains, popping up here and there in a bloom of date palms, or a crash of green grasses. Travel to Timia is intrepid, and promises fulfilling encounters with the desert nomads and villagers of the region. "
Kouré,"Kouré is the place to go giraffe spotting. Encompassed by hot and sandy Sahelian landscapes, the tiny town has its claim to fame in the long-necked creatures that stalk its backcountry. They are said to be the last remaining complete giraffe herd in all of West Africa; an honor which continues to draw wide-eyed folk over the rumbling pathways from the capital (more than 60 kilometers to the north-west) by the bucket load. Local guides can help you spot the rare creatures, but be prepared, because you may need to walk some before they reveal themselves! "
Dosso,"Dosso, ancient Dosso, is one of the few palpable remaining relics of the pre-colonial era of Niger. The onetime epicenter of the Dosso Kingdom, the state that commanded the loyalty of tribes in the south-west corner of the country before the coming of the Europeans, it&#8217;s a place alive with heritage and traditions. Today the town is a fusion of the new and old, with low-rise concrete buildings mixing with ramshackle yurts. The marketplace still bustles with life too, as groaning camels move in and out of the dusty streets all around. "
Balleyara,"A trip to the famous animal bazaar of Balleyara Market is a glimpse at the traditional lifestyles of central Africa. A fusion of tribes and peoples, it draws traders from Mali, Burkina Faso and all over the far-flung reaches of greater Niger. The result is a crash of folksy stalls and emporiums touting curious pieces of whittled art and good luck charms. The other side – and by far the largest – of the market is the animal area, which means seeing everything from bull herds to camels changing hands. And the really good news? Balleyara can be reached in just two hours from the capital at Niamey. "
Arlit,"If you can get past the overtly industrial character of Arlit, then you might just appreciate the town for the earthy and folksy place that it is. Deep in the wild Agadez Region, it&#8217;s one of the best gateways to the vast dunes of the Ténéré Desert (although, admittedly, Agadez is better). The homes are crumbling, sunbaked bricks of mud; the people are tired uranium miners with leather-like faces, and you can pretty much be certain that very few – if any – travelers have ever lingered here for very long before you. "
Diffa,"Diffa is a difficult place to pin down. At times it&#8217;s been a tenacious hotbed for military uprisings against the Niger government; at others – like today – it&#8217;s a receptacle for the thousands of refugees that come flocking across the Nigerian border in fear of militant groups and extremists. Unfortunately, those more recent developments have made the place pretty unsafe for modern travelers (even by Niger&#8217;s standards), so it looks like we&#8217;ll have to wait to explore the peaks and troughs of the dust-caked Diffa Region &#8211; the home of wandering waterbucks and rare leopards and more. "
Calabar,"The gateway to the reserves of the Cross River (the state of which Calabar is the capital), and the further-flung rainforests of the Afi Mountains (home to gorillas, chimps, rare rockfowl and craggy peaks of stone), the town of Calabar is a well-honed tourist stop-off on the way through to Cameroon or the southern Nigerian coast. Before making a beeline for the amazing primate sanctuaries outside of the town though, be sure to linger a little and case out the darker past of the city at the Calabar Museum – Calabar was once one of the principle slave trading ports in West Africa. Also worth a look is the Duke Town chapel, which is considered one of the oldest Christian worshipping houses in Nigeria. "
Lagos,"Frenetic and packed, Lagos is not only the largest city in Nigeria, but also the single largest on the entire African continent. Yep, nearly 18 million people call this one home, and boy does it show! Throbbing streets of beer bars and clubs pepper the districts of Ikeja and Victoria Island, where ex-pats and sailors and locals alike chat over frothy brews. There are also salt-washed promenades on the coast, and the beautiful reaches of Lagos Bar Beach – a sloping stretch of golden sand that meets the waves of the Atlantic Ocean in style. Meanwhile, jet skis purr across Tarkwa Bay, and the sobering histories of the slave trade continue to move at the Point of No Return. "
Abeokuta,"Nestled inland, directly north of sprawling Lagos, the regional capital of the Ogun State can be found surrounded by great swathes of yam fields and maize farms, swaying wooded savanna and palm oil plantations. An historic location on the important trade routes between the coast and the heart of West Africa led to previous inhabitants raising adobe fortifications around the old town, many of which can still be seen today. However, it&#8217;s the bulbous rises of the Olumo Rock that soars atop the town that really draws the eye. This ancient natural fort plays host to a great cultural museum, a craft shop selling local artworks, and caves that showcase the human history of the Ogun region as a whole. "
Yankari National Park,"Whether you make the arduous journey east from Abuja and south from Gombe to the Yankari in search of the roaming herds of African elephants (rumored to be the most numerous on the continent) or to seek out the fascinating relics of earlier peoples in the caves, you can rest assured that this well-serviced national park won&#8217;t disappoint. More than 20,000 people come here to partake in ecotourism every year, which means there are plenty of lodges and tour operators on the ground. Don&#8217;t leave without scaling the lookouts on Kalban Hill, or wondering at the chiseled rocks of the awesome Tonlong Gorge. "
Abuja,"Okay, so Abuja ain&#8217;t no Lagos. Purpose-built, enfolded by the soft topography of the inland hills, and formed from clearly delineated districts that house business-suited men and politicians, there&#8217;s no grit or grime here (or at least not relatively). That means the capital is a nice place to relax and unwind following the energy and action of the megalopolis on the coast. And there are other interesting sights too, like the Abuja Millennium Park and the quad of spear-like minarets that heralds the beautiful Abuja National Mosque. Meanwhile, Wuse Market is great for shoppers, and the National Assembly Complex offers a glimpse into the country&#8217;s modern political system. "
Ibadan,"State capital and erstwhile stronghold of the old Oyo Empire, Ibadan hides quite a lot of history and heritage between its streets. The only problem is, those streets seem to go on forever and ever (some estimations say that Ibadan is the single largest metropolis by geographical coverage in Africa), making the interesting parts pretty hard to find! A good place to start is in the exhibition rooms of the National Museum of Ibadan, where traditional Egungun garments meet tribal war drums and more. Then, try to discover the Bower Memorial Tower, before hitting the colonial facades of Mapo Hall. "
Kainji Lake National Park,"One of the natural jewels of north-western Nigeria is actually not all that natural at all. Yep, the eponymous Kainji Lake of the Kainji Lake National Park is actually a reservoir, created in 1968 and now surrounded by protected game reserves. On the western banks of the water is the Borgu area, which hosts sporadic pockets of Guinean woods and plains, the stomping ground of some truly fascinating beasts: hippopotami; roan antelopes and swinging baboons. This eventually gives way to the reservoir itself, where primeval jungles dip down into the croc-spotted waters. "
Gashaka Gumti National Park,"Vast and breathtaking at every turn, the Gashaka Gumti National Park covers more than 6,000 square kilometers of land in the extreme south-east of the country. Made in 1991 after the fusion of two great Nigerian game reserves, it&#8217;s famed for its winding rivers (some of which also occasionally turn into awesome shows of roaring waterfalls) and riparian habitats, which host rare avian species like the red-faced lovebird. On the ground, you can expect to be in the company of African golden cats and elephants. Chimps swing in the trees of the forests too, while buffalos pepper the watering holes. "
Enugu,"A green and leafy town that&#8217;s nestled almost equidistance between the Cross River National Park (the home of Nigeria&#8217;s gorillas) and the delta of the River Niger (where the Bayelsa National Forest has baby chimps), Enugu certainly doesn&#8217;t want for natural attractions. In fact, that prime location close to some of the best natural draws of the Nigerian south-east is one of the main reasons tourists come here. Others will enjoy the tidy streets and the low-rise buildings, the down-to-earth locals (the lifeblood of the small bottling and movie industries that have germinated here), and the gushing waterfalls and caves of the Ezeagu Tourist Complex – just on the edge of the city. "
Port Harcourt,"Okay, so it&#8217;s hardly a secret that industry comes first in the rambunctious oil boomtown of Port Harcourt. A soaring population, endless developments of cookie-cutter tenements and the logos of major oil companies are just a few of the things this throbbing petroleum town wears on its sleeve. And while the frenetic buzz of depots, trucks and tankers here certainly isn&#8217;t for everyone, the down-to-earth character of the place, mixed with a particularly raucous nightlife scene means that some will love the earthy, raw and unpretentious nature of it all. "
Erin-Ijesha,"The tiny town of Erin-Ijesha is really only known for one thing and one thing only: it&#8217;s eponymous waterfall that crashes through the southern Nigerian jungles, spans two individual states, and counts as many as seven tiers in total! The beautiful water feature draws oodles of people to this tiny speck on the map a little way from the historic city of Ilesa. The journey&#8217;s worth it though. You&#8217;ll get to climb through the verdant woods and bathe in the cataracts as they crash over the cliffs. You&#8217;ll learn about the forest spirits, and even discover the nearby hot springs at Ikogosi – a little to the east, and a great place for soothing those tired hiking muscles. "
Uyo,"Another great gateway to the trans-border Cross River National Park, and a brilliant stopover on the way to Calabar city, the town of Uyo is a clean and efficient urban center with a pretty lively nightlife scene of music bars and beer haunts. It&#8217;s surrounded by green swathes of mangrove forest, out of which pokes the city&#8217;s famous golf resort (run by the prestigious name of Le Méridien no less). In the town there&#8217;s also the endless boutiques and fashion stores of the Ibom Plaza, where Nigerian celebs often strut their stuff. And if the city gets too much, make a beeline for the coast. Ibeno Beach is the top choice, with its footprint-spotted sands coming in as some of the longest in all of West Africa. "
Okomu National Park,"One of the few remaining enclaves of the virgin rainforest that once dominated the territories of southern Nigeria for its entirety, the Okomu National Park can be found sandwiched between the endless mangroves that crash into the Atlantic Ocean and the streets of Benin City. Untouched and undeveloped, the spot&#8217;s remoteness has allowed it to become a refuge for some of the country&#8217;s rarer creatures, like the pangolin, chimpanzees, leopards and even forest elephants. There&#8217;s also a smattering of rustic tribal villages still here, where visitors can encounter the age-old way of Nigerian country life. "
Benin City,"Located just a little to the east of the aforementioned reserves of the Okomu National Park, Benin City is not only a great place to launch your explorations through the wilds of southern Nigeria, but also an interesting, lived-in industrial town with plenty of history of its own. In fact, the town was once the middle of the Benin Empire, back when it was called Edo, and thrived with the creation of architectural feats like the old Oba Palace – still visible in the center. There are also fascinating open-air bronze workshops along bustling Igun Street to see, along with a branch of the National Museum. "
Edumanom National Forest,"The great mass of greenery that caps the very end of the Niger River, this delta forest plays host to one of Nigeria&#8217;s most amazing displays of biodiversity. It&#8217;s headed by the presence of some of the largest remaining chimpanzee colonies in the world, who patrol the freshwater swamps and the verdant canopies, casting howls through the wilderness as they go. It&#8217;s also a home to the rare Niger Delta colobus and other primates worth seeing. Thanks to its far-flung location, travel here won&#8217;t be easy, but the untrodden undergrowth and untamed wilds might just be worth it! "
Norwich,"The city&#8217;s Cathedral is a wonder, completed quickly in the Norman style and clad with a cream-coloured limestone brought all the way from Caen. Some gothic changes and extensions were made in the centuries years that followed, like the two storey cloister, the only one of its kind in England. Norwich Museum also has Norman origins and houses the city&#8217;s museum, the place where you&#8217;ll encounter the ancient Queen Boudica, an English national icon, or the Snettisham Hoard, a gold treasure from the Iron Age. See what&#8217;s on at the modern Forum, which puts on the exhibitions and shows, and potter around the city&#8217;s beautiful old areas like Elm Hill and the banks of River Wensum. "
Great Yarmouth,"Up there with Blackpool as one of England&#8217;s most treasured seaside destinations, Great Yarmouth has received holidaymakers since the 1760s. The sandy shoreline is vast, and goes on for 17 miles in the Greater Yarmouth area. If the old-school joys of sand castles and paddling don&#8217;t cut the mustard with your kids and teenagers there&#8217;s the ever-popular Pleasure Beach a free-to-enter theme park buzzing with rides and amusements. There&#8217;s more fun on the Golden Mile, lined with arcades and the marvellous art nouveau Empire Cinema, currently being restored to its former glory. "
King&#8217;s Lynn,"In medieval times King&#8217;s Lynn was England&#8217;s most important and busiest port, trading with the Hanseatic League in the Low Countries and Baltic. A catalogue of majestic old buildings survive from this time, like the splendid Guildhall of St George, which is both the largest and oldest guildhall in the country. On the quay of the Great River Ouse are Hanseatic warehouses with exposed timbers, and it&#8217;s exciting to think about all the goods that have been stored in these historic buildings. And you&#8217;ll know that King&#8217;s Lynn was a big deal from its fabulous minster and imposing properties like Castle Rising, and the 15th-century Oxburgh Hall. "
The Broads,"In summer this low-lying area with its huge open skies and picturesque villages is almost heavenly. It&#8217;s a region of lakes, rivers and man-made waterways that are mostly accessible to boats, barges and canoes. What most people love is the sense of freedom that the Broads offer; allowing you to hop into your vessel and spend days going where you please. You can moor up and sunbathe or go ashore for a walk in secluded woodland. On the way you&#8217;ll spot landmarks like old windmills, designed to drain the land and mostly still working today. "
Cromer,"Dominated by a beautiful Gothic church, this resort has more of a demure glamour about it than a typical English bucket and spade retreat. The first to consider Cromer a holiday destination were wealthy Georgians, who built summer homes away from the traditional fishing quarter and came to bathe in the sea. And that&#8217;s largely where Cromer&#8217;s attraction lies today, at the beach, which often swells enough for surfers, and the beautiful Victorian pier with a legendary theatre. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has a vital station in Cromer, and there&#8217;s a wonderful museum for Henry Blogg, the most decorated lifeboatman in the service. Cromer also still has a small fleet of crabbing boats, and the delicious shellfish is in season from March to October. "
Wroxham,"This is actually two villages (Wroxham and Hoveton) bestriding the River Bure, in the gorgeous scenery of the Norfolk Broads. Wroxham is sometimes marketed as the &#8220;Capital of the Broads&#8221;, and is certainly the place to come for classic Broads activities like cruises and self-captained boat trips along this beautiful network of rivers. You can also rent a bike, which is a family-friendly option as the low-lying landscapes are very easy-going and there&#8217;s lots of woodland and open spaces to stop and take picnics by the water. "
Wymondham Abbey,"Just a delightful country town, Wymondham has a marketplace featuring the traditional cross, which is raised on stilts as a means of keeping the town&#8217;s charters and other documents safe from vermin and floodwater. This is one of many half-timbered houses in the town, along with many that have the flint decoration that is typical in this part of Norfolk. Wymondham Abbey is the town&#8217;s great monument, a marvellous gothic building from between the 12th and 15th centuries. When the monasteries were dissolved in the 16th century it had a fallow spell before becoming a parish church under the reign of Elizabeth I after she visited it in person in 1573. "
Sheringham,"On Norfolk&#8217;s north coast, Sheringham is a traditional fishing and crabbing town, which now attracts visitors for its old-time maritime atmosphere. This is only enhanced by the grand North Norfolk Railway, a steam-powered line that runs from Sheringham to the town of Holt. The local council has fought hard against brands and chain stores taking over its high street, which still has a local and independent spirit. And in a modern, purpose-built home overlooking the North Sea is a the Mo Museum, which delves into all aspects of Sheringham&#8217;s past, from the shipwrights and fishers of the 19th century to fragments of elephant bone dating back 1.5 million years and found at the base of the town&#8217;s cliffs. "
"Captain Mainwaring Statue, Thetford","The walls of many of the older buildings in Thetford are decorated with flint, which is abundant in the western part of Norfolk. This higher ground was settled by Celtic tribes, and Grimes Graves in the Thetford Forest Park is an intriguing flint mine founded around 5,000 years ago. At the Ancient House Museum you&#8217;ll find out more about flint knapping, and see the Thetford Treasure, a hoard of Roman gold, silver and precious stones. If you like British television comedy you may recognise Thetford&#8217;s flint buildings from the TV series Dad&#8217;s Army, which filmed its outdoor scenes in the town: There&#8217;s a statue of the character Captain Mainwaring by the river, and a museum for the show open during the summer. "
Swaffham,"Superb for its location as well as its understated elegance, Swaffham is at the northern tip of the Brecks. For centuries this arid landscape was impossible to farm, and sandstorms even took place, until new irrigation techniques arrived in the 20th century. The museum in the centre of this refined Georgian town has displays on Howard Carter, the Swaffham born Egyptologist who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamen 1922.  Swaffham also has the only wind turbine on the planet open to the public. The Green Britain Centre has exhibitions about renewable energy, and you can scale the 67-metre Enercon Turbine for a gorgeous view. "
Wells-next-the-Sea,"The sandy beach at this quaintly-named resort is often rated as the best in Norfolk. And it&#8217;s certainly spectacular: An enormous sweep of flaxen sand with dunes and pine forest that is trimmed by a long line of sweet beach huts raised on stilts. The beach is actually some way from the town, and separated by marshes and farmland, but there&#8217;s a narrow gauge railway trundling down to the seafront from the resort. In the town you can browse little alleys like the adorably twee Staithe Street, which has galleries, artisan shops and traditional amenities not often found in English towns like butchers and a bakery. "
"Diss, Norfolk","A charming town of half-timbered houses on the boundary of Norfolk, Diss is an artistic community as illustrated by the Corn Hall. This old neoclassical stock exchange has been repurposed as a performing arts centre, partly run by volunteers and hosting theatre, music and dance. In the middle of the town is the strange Diss Mere, an ovular lake covering more than two  hectares and ringed with greenery, though nobody&#8217;s too sure exactly how it was formed. If you&#8217;re feeling fit and want to feel like one of the Iceni Celtic tribe you could walk all the way from Diss to Norfolk, 40 miles to the north on Boudica&#8217;s Way. This takes in the Roman ruins at Venta Icenorum. "
Dereham,"In the geographical heart of the county, Dereham is a quintessential Norfolk town with well-preserved history and plenty of little details to seek out. Very typical for the county is Bishop Bonner&#8217;s Cottage, which was built in 1502 and has &#8220;pinking&#8221;, a decorative plasterwork to keep the building waterproof. There&#8217;s a museum about Dereham inside, informing you about the 16th-century Bishop Bonner&#8217;s ties with town. The market square is surrounded by Georgian townhouses, and the Norman parish church is unique for having a separate bell-tower. Pay a visit to Fendick&#8217;s Mill, which dates to 1836 and has recently been restored. "
Fakenham,"A peaceful sort of place, Fakenham has recently been voted one of the best towns to live in England. Fakenham has preserved the 17th and 18th-century flat-fronted buildings in its centre, and is crowned by the imposing tower of the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, which was erected in the 1400s. In Fakenham you can connect with lost ways of life: The town has kept its original &#8220;town gasworks&#8221; and is the last place in England or Wales to retain this old utility, which would produce gas from coal solely for the homes and businesses of Fakenham. It was closed down in the 50s but is now a museum with all its machinery intact. "
Hunstanton,"Due to its westerly aspect, Hunstanton has one of the only beaches for hundreds of miles where you can watch the sun set over the water. If you&#8217;re put off by the noise and glitz of a resort like Great Yarmouth, Hunstanton has more of a small town feel, with a gorgeous beach and lots of wildlife. Walk up the coast for a few minutes to see the town&#8217;s two-tone cliffs, which are red limestone at the bottom with a band of chalk at the top. You can board a boat to voyage into The Wash, where the sandbanks have large seal colonies. There are also seals at the Sea Life Sanctuary in the town, where you can introduce little guys to the nature just off England&#8217;s North Sea Coast. "
"Lake Lure, North Carolina","There is no doubt that Lake Lure is one of the most beautiful places to visit in North Carolina. The history of the town dates back over a hundred years and it has been a popular filming spot for Hollywood, with movies such as Thunder Road and Dirty Dancing having been partially filmed in the Lake Lure area. Tours of Lake Lure are popular, with one of the most stunning parts of this corner of the state being the gorgeous Lake Lure Flowering Bridge. "
Bryson City,"Bryson City is one of the oldest settlements in North Carolina, with Native Americans having lived in the area for at least 14,000 years. The town is notable for being surrounded by mountains, which gives it incredible scenery that has to be seen to be believed. River rafting is one of the most popular things to do in Bryson City, while taking a trip on the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad is well worth it too. Cooper Creek Trout Farm &amp; Pond and the Smokey Mountain Trains Museum are among the other excellent days out in Bryson City. "
Nags Head,"Nags Head is one of the most popular tourist locations in North Carolina due to its many superb beaches and wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. Jockey&#8217;s Ridge State Park is the main landmark in the town, offering stunning views of Nags Head and beyond. The park is also notable for having the tallest natural sand dune system in the eastern United States, while a choice of several historic cottages in the town itself make it a great place to spend a long weekend. "
Cape Hatteras Lighthouse,"Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is a particularly notable North Carolina landmark due to the fact it is the tallest brick lighthouse structure in the United States. The lighthouse is open seasonally but only the fittest should take on the climb to the top as there are almost 250 steps to get up. Although it is a long trip to the top, climbing the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is a unique experience and the views are well worth the effort. The lighthouse was moved slightly inland in 1999 due to land erosion. "
Chimney Rock State Park,"Some of the best scenery North Carolina has to offer can be enjoyed at Chimney Rock State Park. The signature 315-foot spire overlooking Hickory Nut Gorge and Lake Lure is the highlight of the park, which has a range of child-friendly nature explorations and more challenging hikes. Trout fishermen love to spend time at the Rocky Broad River, while the nearby Rumbling Bald Climbing Access is one of the most popular spots within the park. The Devil&#8217;s Head balancing rock is a must for anyone visiting the park, while many of the final scenes of the 1992 adaptation of The Last of the Mohicans were filmed at Chimney Rock State Park. "
Emerald Isle,"Summer season is a fantastic place to visit Emerald Isle, which is definitely one of the most beautiful places to visit in North Carolina. Despite the population growing exponentially during the summer, Emerald Isle retains a family feel, with Water Boggan a must-visit for anyone with kids. Emerald Forest Golf is another terrific day out for all the family when visiting Emerald Isle, while there are lots of great spots for kitesurfing and fishing in the area too. "
"Freedom Park, Charlotte, NC","Freedom Park is one of the most relaxed spots in Charlotte, with the park among North Carolina&#8217;s most beautiful places too. Festival in the Park &#8211; recognized as a Top 20 Event by the Southeast Tourism Society &#8211; attracts 100,000 visitors every September, with people flocking to watch films in the stunning setting over a five-day period. Right next to the park is the Charlotte Nature Museum, where families can learn all about the animals and plants that can be found in the Piedmont area. "
Grogan Creek Falls,"Deep within Pisgah National Forest in Transylvania County is Grogan Creek and Cedar Rock Falls, the latter of which is a 20-foot falls that is without a doubt one of the most stunning sights anywhere in North Carolina. To find Cedar Rock Falls, simply head downstream from Cedar Rock and Grogan Creeks. Some of the falls are not the biggest, but they are all extremely photogenic. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The most visited park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a must for anyone on a vacation in North Carolina. The park, which straddles the border of the state and Tennessee, is home to the Appalachian Trail which runs right the way through its heart. The observation tower at Clingmans Dome is one of the best spots within the grounds of the park, offering incredible views across the stunning vista. Cades Cove is the park&#8217;s single most frequented destination, offering churches, barns and log cabins. The Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill at Oconaluftee within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are worth visiting too. "
Merchants Millpond State Park,"Merchants Millpond State Park is perfect for anyone who wants to try kayaking or canoeing during a trip to North Carolina. The large cypress swamps are also home to a number of alligators, while fishing, biking and hiking are all popular activities within the grounds of the park. The park is built around a 200-year-old, 700-acre millpond and Lassiter Swamp and can be found near Gatesville. "
Charlotte,"As the main city in North Carolina, visiting Charlotte is a must for anyone vacationing in the state. With Freedom Park and Discovery Place among the most beautiful spots in Charlotte, there is loads to do for all the family. Sports fans in particular will find lots to love in Charlotte, as it hosts two NASCAR Sprint Cup races and the NASCAR All-Star Race, as well as an NFL team &#8211; the Carolina Panthers, and Charlotte Hornets of the NBA. Top things to do in the city include the Levine Museum of the New South, Carolinas Aviation Museum and the Carowinds theme park, which has some of the best rollercoasters anywhere in North Carolina. "
Sliding Rock,"Waterfalls tend to be beautiful and serene, but Sliding Rock in North Carolina is also heaps of fun. Located in the Pisgah National Forest, near Brevard and Asheville, thousands of kids and adults slide down the falls every year. Some 11,000 gallons of water flow down the rock each minute and Sliding Rock is extremely popular on hot summer days, when large queues can form at the site. But if it is busy, soaking up the wonderful sights and sounds of the Pisgah National Forest are a great option too. "
Kitty Hawk,"Kitty Hawk is one of the most important historic sites in North Carolina, as it is where the Wright Brothers made their first controlled powered airplane flights. Based on the Outer Banks of North Carolina in Dare County, Kitty Hawk has a wide range of plant and animal life at a 461-acre maritime forest reserve called Kitty Hawk Wood, while there is also a small and relaxed beach community of residential cottages and hotels. "
"Land Of Oz, North Carolina","The yellow brick road from abandoned theme park The Land of Oz in Beech Mountain is one of the strangest and most beautiful sites in North Carolina. The Land of Oz opened in 1970 but closed after just a few years, but there is still a lot of physical evidence of the now-defunct park, as well as the yellow brick road, that remains today. Beech Mountain itself is the highest town east of the Rocky Mountains, with the Beech Mountain Ski Resort one of the few places to ski in this corner of the United States. "
Blue Ridge Mountains,"The Blue Ridge Mountains are among the most beautiful natural sites in North Carolina. The Blue Ridge Parkway is great for driving enthusiasts, offering quite astonishing views across the state. Within the Blue Ridge province itself are two of the state&#8217;s major national parks: the Shenandoah National Park and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Altapass Orchard &#8211; an Appalachian cultural and historical center &#8211; is a great spot to visit during a trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains. "
Durham,"As one of North Carolina&#8217;s largest cities, Durham is also among its top tourist attractions, drawing millions of people every single year. The city is home to some of the state&#8217;s most important historic sites, such as Bennett Place, where the negotiations that effectively ended the Civil War took place. The annual Bull Durham Blues Festival also takes place in Durham, which hosts a diverse local music culture. Eno River State Park is one of the most beautiful places in Durham, while visitors should also take time to check out the Little River Regional Park and Natural Area and the Sarah P. Duke Gardens, which can be found on the campus of the famous Duke University. "
"Bridal Veil Falls, North Carolina","Bridal Veil Falls is definitely one of North Carolina&#8217;s most beautiful places to visit. The 120-foot falls are among the tallest in this part of the United States, while the area was also one of the filming locations for the Hunger Games franchise, starring Jennifer Lawrence. Hiking to Bridal Veil is possible from either the High Falls or Fawn Lake parking areas within DuPont State Forest. Bridal Veil Falls are far from the only waterfalls within the park, with Wintergreen Falls and nearby High Falls, Triple Falls and Hooker Falls all worth seeing during a trip to North Carolina. "
"Gackle, North Dakota","Interesting starts with the name.  Gackle was named after George Gackle, the farmer who founded the town in the early twentieth century.  Three hundred people now call it home.  Located on a beautiful prairie in the southern part of the state, Gackle is known by some as the Duck Hunting Capital of the World. The locals are friendly and love sharing their town and states history with visitors.  You’ll definitely see some big sky here.  Be sure to visit one of the many lakes in the area:  Hehn-Schaffer, Arnies, and Marvin Miller are some of the most popular. If hunting isn’t for you, enjoy boating and fishing as you relax in this lovely town. "
"Jud, North Dakota","Jud is the Town of Murals.  It’s 75-ish residents have come together over the years and painted beautiful murals on almost all of the buildings in town.  It’s one of a kind from top to bottom.  Named for a politician in the earlier twentieth century, the murals lend a sweetness to the town. You’ll see cottages, landscapes, patriotic scenes, cartoon characters, and even postage stamps on the buildings.  It’s a unique take on community that shouldn’t be missed. "
"Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Medora","Completely within the boundaries of Theodore Roosevelt National Park is Medora.  There are only about 150 residents, but it’s considered the number one tourist destination in the state. The activities that Medora affords are almost endless.  Stroll around the town proper and visit Chateau de Mores, a historical site that was once the summer home to the towns founder. For more history visit the 19th century meat packing plant.  Check out Chimney Park, or Pitchfork Steak Fondue – a scenic spot overlooking Tjaden Terrace bluff where they’ll cook you a western style steak.  If you’re lucky, catch a show at Burning Hills Amphitheatre, an open air venue next to the Missouri River Valley.  They’re famous for the Medora Musical.  It’s a tribute to the time President Roosevelt spent in the area. Most people love to learn more about his time as a Badlands rancher. With the national park on all sides, you’ll be blown away by all the beauty. "
New Salem,"Founded in the late nineteenth century, New Salem has a very interesting attraction.  In the 1970’s, the local Lion’s Club built a 38 foot Holstein cow.  Made entirely out of fiberglass, Salem Sue is a monument to the hardworking dairymen of the area.  Tourists love to stop and see this amazing cow. Many North Dakotans retire to New Salem because of the slow pace and natural beauty. There’s a lot of history to see, as well as six local parks, and a beautiful old auditorium where you can catch a show like the Cow Town Hoe Down. "
"Valley City, North Dakota","The City of Bridges is located on the curving Sheyenne River.  Valley City is home to no less than 11 historical bridges.  The most famous are the wooden Valley City State University footbridge, and the Highline Bridge.  This is one of the highest rail bridges in the US and is a designated landmark with the National Civil Engineering system.  Visit sacred American India burial grounds in Medicine Wheel Park as well as two ancient solar calendars.  Most visitors spend a day on the Sheyenne River Valley National Scenic Byway.  It covers over sixty miles from Lisbon to Baldhill Dam.  It’s absolutely gorgeous in the fall when the leaves change. You can also enjoy snowmobiling, downhill and cross country skiing as well as birding, biking, hiking, and canoeing. Don’t forget to bring your camera. "
Hatton,"Settled in the late nineteenth century by hardy pioneers, Hatton and Garfield Township lay in the eastern part of the state.  The name changed to Garfield after President Garfield’s assassination several years after county and surrounding townships were developed. Originally a trading post, today the population is less than 1,000.  It’s most famous resident was Car Ben Eielson. In 1928, he became the first person to fly over both the North and South Poles.  You can see a monument and museum to his life and adventures when you visit. "
Walhalla Trading Post,"The second oldest community in North Dakota is just a few miles from the Canadian border. Walhalla is known as the Heart of the Rendezvous Region. If you love history, this is a great stop for you.  The oldest building in the state is here, the Kittson Trading Post.  You can also visit the Gingras Trading Post State Historic site to see some of the oldest Euro-American structures in North Dakota. To the west of town is Pembina Gorge State Recreation Area.  Several trails give you miles and miles of hiking opportunities.  Or if you’re more adventurous, on horseback. In addition, the Pembina Gorge affords plenty of outdoor activities.  Mountain biking, primitive camping, tubing along the Pembina River, birding, and geo cashing. The Tetrault Woods State Forest is a dedicated and undeveloped wildlife setting.  Enjoy both of the awe-inspiring overlooks while visiting. "
Bottineau,"The Four Seasons Playground, otherwise known as Bottineau, North Dakota, is another northern town.  Completely surrounded by rolling hills and wonderfully green forests.  The town specializes in outdoor activities suitable for all four seasons. It’s tucked between two federal wildlife refuges, you’ll find plenty of moose, deer, geese, and duck.  It’s the last stop on the way to the Turtle Mountains, which has a reputation for being a Mecca for adrenaline junkies.  In town you’ll find Tommy the Turtle.  He’s Bottineau’s town mascot, and he’s also 26 feet tall.  Making him the world’s largest turtle! "
"Jamestown, North Dakota","Jamestown is one of the larger communities on this list.  But at roughly 16,000 souls, it’s still got the heart and feel of a small town.  It’s been nicknamed the Pride of the Prairie thanks to its long history.  It begins with the building of the Northern Pacific Railway.  You can revisit this late nineteenth century setting at the Jamestown Frontier Village.  Visitors are treated to re-enactments of what life on a prairie town was like.  In the Village, you can also visit the Louis L’Amour Writer’s Shack, a novelist of American Westerns who was born there in 1908.  Visit the National Buffalo Museum and see the 26-foot-tall Dakota Thunder, the states monument to the buffalo.  You can see many varieties of bison here, as well as the world’s only certified albino bison. "
Edgeley,"The largest wind farms in the state are in Edgeley.  With a population of less than 700, this town is a vital agricultural and community oriented place.  It’s a short drive from Jamestown to visit this pastoral setting. In the first years of the twenty-first century, wind energy came to the town.  There are now 41 turbines that are strikingly serene on the horizon.

"Hillsboro, North Dakota","Possibly North Dakota’s quintessential small town is Hillsboro. Another settlement that dates back to the 1860’s, and was literally founded on hospitality.  As prospecting railroad magnate James J Hill traveling the area in preparation for his new railroad, many settlements shunned him due to his shabby appearance.  But, in what would become Hillsboro, they welcomed him with open arms.  The railroad, not surprisingly, ran right through town and helped the settlers survive in the early years.

The coffee is good, the conversation is always flowing, and it’s easy to settling into the slow pace of life Hillsboro affords. "

"York, England","When it comes to heritage, historical appeal and plain good looks, York is practically unmatched in England. The city can be traced back to the 1st century, and during medieval times was England&#8217;s second city after London. York was held in such high esteem by the Georgians it was safeguarded from the chimneystacks of the Industrial Revolution. And so you&#8217;re left with an unspoiled warren of cobblestone streets, corbelled timber houses and 18th-century flat-fronted townhouses. York Minster is one of Northern Europe&#8217;s largest gothic cathedrals and an enduring masterwork of medieval art. When the railways arrived in York the city became an integral transport hub between London and Edinburgh, and you can dip into this history at the peerless National Railway Museum. "
Whitby,"Penned to the coast by the North York Moors, Whitby is a town around a former whaling harbour lodged in the River Esk estuary. The older east bank of the river is all fishing cottages, cobblestone lanes and maritime inns, with a listed building every few steps. Looking down on that east bank are the spectral ruins of Whitby Abbey, claimed to have inspired Bram Stoker to make the town his point of arrival for Dracula. The town has cinematic beaches, historic churches, loads of fragments of its old whaling industry and a museum for Captain James Cook, the first western explorer to reach Australia, New Zealand and the Hawaiian Islands. This attraction is in the former home of the Walker Brothers, ship-owners who employed Cook while he was in Whitby. "
Scarborough,"Packed onto rocky limestone terrain, Scarborough could well be the cream of England&#8217;s seaside resorts and has been attracting tourists since the 1500s. It was the Victorians who made an industry of tourism in Scarborough, engineering promenades between the North and South Bay and atop the South Cliff. The Regency and Victorian architecture in these areas of the old spa resort is appropriately rich. On the seafront next to the fine sandy beach are English seaside essentials like fish and chip shops, ice cream parlours, stands selling cockles and winkles, and the marvellous 19th-century spa complex, now a regal entertainment venue. "
Harrogate,"In the middle of rural North Yorkshire, Harrogate&#8217;s 88 springs became all the rage in the 17th century, and an exclusive spa town was soon born. Harrogate has lost none of that historic lustre, and is replete with dignified Georgian houses, hotels and old pump rooms on cobblestone lanes and grand avenues. Now the name is a synonym for luxury, as illustrated by Betty&#8217;s Cafe Tea Rooms, possibly the finest place for afternoon tea in England and frequented by the Queen when she&#8217;s in town. "
Ripon Cathedral,"England&#8217;s third-smallest city is also the oldest in the country, having been founded more than 1,350 years ago. There are sights in Ripon that will leave you speechless. And this certainly applies to the Studley Royal Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site. This 18th century country garden in the romantic style was designed to complement the atmospheric ruins of Fountains Abbey, which was built in the 12th century and then abandoned in the 1500s. Ripon Cathedral is the other indispensable attraction, designed mostly in the early English gothic style. Look out for the 35 &#8220;misericords&#8221; , carvings on the underside of the choir seats, commissioned in the early-1490s. "
Yorkshire Dales,"Taking up massive swathes of the northwestern side of the county, the Yorkshire Dales are hills and river valleys on a limestone bed. This geology grants the park majestic cave systems that, like Goyden, Stump Cross, Ingleborough and White Scar, are open as show caves for tours. Many others are the preserve of experienced cavers and potholers, and if this interests you there are lots of guides waiting to take you on subterranean adventures. For everyone else the Dales mean hikes in one of the most secluded areas in England where your friends and loved ones, and herds of Swaledale sheep, may be your only company. "
North York Moors,"Those who crave the outdoors are spoiled in North Yorkshire, as the county also has the North York Moors National Park. This is 1,430 square kilometres of heather moorland and forest to the east of the county, continuing right to the North Sea coast where it yields to cliffs and magical sandy beaches. The uplands, with hills rising above 400 metres is dramatic heather moor, while this falls away to deep dales with seams of ancient woodland. There are more mature trees on the North York Moors than any other place in Northern England. Only a few thousand people live on the North York Moors, so settlements are limited to hamlets and villages with pubs that will be a welcome sight for hungry or weary walkers and cyclists. "
Malham Cove,"No settlement in the Yorkshire Dales are blessed with as much limestone formations as the village of Malham. On treks around Malham you&#8217;ll reach a host of minor natural wonders in a matter of minutes. Most photographed is Malham Cove, a sheer wall, 80 metres high and shaped by an ice age river. Climbers love to scale the cliffs, while cave divers explore the maze-like cave system and the base, which is at least 1.6 kilometres long. There&#8217;s an awe-inspiring raving at Gordale Scar, painted by Turner and eulogised by the poet William Wordsworth. Then there&#8217;s Malham Tarn, England&#8217;s highest lake and a National Trust site for its unusual alkaline waters and biology. "
Helmsley Castle,"This market town straddles the boundary of the North York Moors National Park and is the trailhead for the long-distance Cleveland Way, which curls through the park and along the coast down to Filey more than 110 metres away. If there&#8217;s one monument you must see in Helmsley it&#8217;s the ruins of Rievaulx Abbey. The ruins are managed by English Heritage and are some of the most complete of any abandoned abbey in the country. This was once one of England&#8217;s wealthiest Cistercian monasteries until it was dissolved by Henry VIII in the 1500s. There&#8217;s much more to the town than this though, as Helmsley features a castle brewery a centre for birds of prey and an exquisite walled garden from 1759. "
Knaresborough,"People travel  a long way to Knaresborough just for the sight of the town teetering on the steep gorge on the east bank of the River Nidd. And what sets the view off is the lovely Knaresborough Viaduct crossing through the gorge carrying trains into the town. Knaresborough&#8217;s sharp gradient only makes it prettier, as you clamber up the cobblestone streets and staircases that rise from the riverside. On the west bank is a spring with such high mineral content that objects left hanging here take on a stony appearance after a few years. This is also Mother Shipton&#8217;s cave, where the notorious 15th-century prognosticator was supposedly born. "
Grassington,"In the Yorkshire Dales the smart market town of Grassington has a village-like feel and is one of the best places to stay if you&#8217;re thinking of a hiking holiday in the park. There&#8217; a park authority information centre to clue you in everything you can track down in the wilderness close by, and a cute little folk museum depicting traditional costume and trades. The picturesque village of Linton close by has the Linton Falls, a man-made weir with a high volume of water crashing on the rocks below. These waters were channelled to power old textile mills, and a hydroelectric plant here that had been defunct since the 40s was restored in 2012 and now produces power for the village a century after it was installed. "
Saltburn-by-the-Sea,"Up to the mid-1800s there wasn&#8217;t much in Saltburn bar an inn  and a few cottages. That was until the railways arrived, and with them the Pease Family of industrialists from Darlington. The story goes that Henry Pease, a Quaker, had a heavenly vision of a city here resembling Jerusalem in 1858 and ventured to bring it to life. Notice the &#8220;Jewel Streets&#8221; , a series of parallel roads with sea views, named after precious stones (Amber, Pearl, Diamond) and claimed to be inspired by that original vision. The resort had a whole load of innovations, like the water-powered &#8220;Cliff-Lift&#8221; funicular, which still rattles from the pier to the cliff-top. The Zetland Hotel, now apartments,  was remarkable for being one of the first hotels with its own private train platform. "
Hawes,"Like many places towards the North of England Hawes has an Old Norse name, which means &#8220;mountain pass&#8221;. This comes from the Buttertubs Pass, an upland road that now links Hawes with the villages of Muker and Thwaite to the north. And as for the name &#8220;Buttertubs&#8221;, these are the 20-metre limestone potholes on the way, where market traders would store their butter on hot days. Hawes market has been trading since the early-1300s and got its official charter in 1699. Now it takes place on Tuesdays, and the must-buy is Wensleydale cheese, which is produced in Hawes at the Wensleydale Creamery. Inquisitive cheese-lovers can stop by to see how George Orwell&#8217;s second-favourite cheese is made, and try it for themselves afterwards. "
Pickering,"On the southern verge of the North York Moors, Pickering is the town that many travellers choose as their accommodation for their excursions into the park. It&#8217;s a given that the moors are a big draw in Pickering, but there&#8217;s also a weekend&#8217;s worth of interesting things to see in and near the town. Take St Peter and St Paul&#8217;s Church, which has a captivating set of frescos on the walls of the nave, with images like St George slaying the dragon, painted around 1450. Also here are the spectacular ruins of Pickering Castle, with a 13th-century ruin with a chapel and much of the outer walls and towers remaining. Finally, the Beck Isle Museum is a celebrations of all things Victorian, and recreates life in a Market Town in the 1800s. "
Robin Hood&#8217;s Bay,"The achingly pretty Robin Hood&#8217;s Bay is a seafront village with cliffs, beaches and a little nest of alleys and lanes to explore. You&#8217;re also on Yorkshire&#8217;s Dinosaur Coast, where it&#8217;s not too difficult to find fossils in the local shale rock, and dinosaur footprints have even been identified. The village rests in a gap in the cliffs and has no more than a few streets of red brick fishing cottages. The beach is below, and at low-tide seems to never end. You can step inside the old Coastguard Station, which is a National Trust property commanding wonderful coastal views, or walk to the Georgian St Stephen&#8217;s Church in Fylingdales, which has a 200-year-old Georgian interior that has hardly been touched. "
Northampton Guildhall,"The county town is home to almost half of Northamptonshire, and the short commutes to both London and Birmingham continue to make Northampton a desirable place to settle. A good place to start a visit is the Cultural Quarter, which has polished Georgian architecture and one attraction that people travel cross-country to see: 78 Derngate is a Georgian house with an interior redesigned in 1917 by none other than Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of the leading lights of art nouveau and the arts and crafts movement. Northampton Museum is also in the Cultural Quarter and offers a window on the town&#8217;s first boom in the 19th century when it was the centre of the leather and shoemaking industries. There are also some breathtaking country estates very close at Castle Ashby, Althorp House, Coton Manor and Delapré Abbey. "
Kirby Hall,"A large chunk of Northamptonshire&#8217;s population lives in and near this former steel town in the north of the county. One of the peculiar things about Corby is the large number of people with Scottish heritage. Up to a fifth of the town was born north of the border. For sightseeing there&#8217;s an array of country estates outside the town. The most spectacular of these is Kirby Hall, once owned by Sir Christopher Hatton, who was Lord Chancellor to Elizabeth I. Deene Park meanwhile has been in the Brudenell family for more than 500 years, and the regal house and gardens with boulevards and parterre welcome visitors in summer. The medieval Rockingham Castle also merits a visit, and has loads of stories to tell about the English Civil War. "
Oundle,"The historic town of Oundle is constructed with limestone that has wonderful golden tones, and in many ways resembles somewhere like Cambridge but without the colleges. The infamous Fortheringhay Castle is just outside the town, even if there isn&#8217;t much remaining. You can make out the earthworks and masonry of a building that was once a favourite residence of Richard III, who was born here in 1452, and also saw the execution of Mary Queen of Scots in 1587. The castle was dismantled shortly after, and a lot of the stone was used in Oundle, notably at the historic Talbot Inn. Have a wander around Oundle and go by old pubs like the Ship Inn, a coaching inn from the 1300s and the Rose &amp; Crown on the marketplace, serving customers the 17th-century. "
"St Mary Church, Higham Ferrers","Although a relatively minor settlement in the Nene Valley, Higham Ferrers deserves a detour for its history and very charming ensemble of period properties. St Mary&#8217;s Church has one of those Northamptonshire spires, and was founded in the 13th century. Much of the original architecture is still in place, and the stonework on the west port is likely to have been crafted by the same masons responsible for London&#8217;s Westminster Abbey. College Street is particularly historic and is the site of a college from 1422, set up by Henry Chichele, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time. There&#8217;s a hall belonging to this long-defunct institution, now putting on occasional art exhibitions. "
Rushden,"Part of one of the larger urban areas in the county, Rushden&#8217;s biggest landmark is the medieval Church of St Mary, which has a 60-metre spire. And for repose there are the lawns and paths of Rushden Hall Park, surrounding a historic manor house that opens for exhibitions about the town in summer. An intriguing relic from the days when Rushden was on the railway network can be visited at the Rushed Transport Museum. This attraction preserves the old Victorian train station and ticket hall, which opened in 1894, and also has a real ale bar for grown-ups. "
Daventry,"If you&#8217;d like to dawdle around the market town of Daintry for a while, Sheaf Street is a good entry point. In the middle of the town&#8217;s pedestrianised shopping precinct, Sheaf Street has many of Daventry&#8217;s period properties, comprising former staging inns and handsome Georgian townhouses. There are more than 70 listed buildings in all, and if you show up on Tuesday or Friday you&#8217;ll be in time for the street market on the high street. Daventry won the privilege to stage a market back in 1255 during the reign of Henry III. Also, in Northamptonshire you&#8217;re never far from a marvellous stately home, and so it goes in Daventry which is a minutes north of Canons Ashby House, dating to 1550. "
Kettering,"In the centre of the county, Kettering is a working market town that serves as a shopping destination for people from the villages around. If you&#8217;re coming from outside the region the main motive for visiting is to bring children to the superb family days out in the area. Wicksteed Park opened its doors all the way back in 1921, making it the second-oldest theme park in England. There&#8217;s a nostalgic glamour about the Wicksteed Park, typified by the narrow gauge steam railway, and the park was a sensation when it opened, needing special train services to bring in visitors from across the East Midlands. Kids will also be wild about Bugtopia a hands-on zoo where they can handle all kinds of creepy crawlies. "
Brackley,"The marketplace in Brackley is one of the most arresting townscapes in Northamptonshire, with rows of historic inns and flat-fronted houses around the Town Hall. This elegant, quoined building is from 1704 and you can see the arches on the ground floor where there used to be a covered market and which have since been closed up. Americans may be interested in the village of Sulgrave, just north of Brackley. Open to visitors is Sulgrave Manor, the ancestral home of the Washington family, who sold it off in the mid-1600s after George Washington&#8217;s great grandfather emigrated to Virginia. "
Helmdon Church,"A little way outside Brackley is a quaint village made from a fetching pale limestone. This stone  has been quarried in the area since the 1300s, and became the material for some of the region&#8217;s grandest country houses like Stowe House in Buckinghamshire and Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. There&#8217;s a quintessential Nottinghamshire spire in Helmdon, belonging to Mary Magdalene Church, built in the gothic style around the 13th and 14th centuries. And on a very different tack, if your idea of a fun day out is crushing cars with a tank or firing a vintage musket, go nuts at Tanks-Alot, which is every military enthusiast&#8217;s dream come true. "
Silverstone Circuit,"Also minutes from Brackley in the south of Northamptonshire is a village with a name that will be known to all Formula 1 racing fans. Silverstone is at the midway point between Northampton and Oxford, and has been the circuit for the British Grand Prix since 1948. The story of this track echoes that of many around Britain, as it started out as an airfield, in this case a bomber station for the RAF. During most weeks, apart from when there&#8217;s a major even on, the circuit has a menu of driving experiences in Ferraris,  Porsches, Aston Martins and single-seater race cars. The village of Silverstone also has two golf courses that welcome pay-and -play, and for a complete change of pace, Catanger Llamas in neighbouring Towcester, is a llama farm in bucolic farmland. "
Lille,"Right against the border with Belgium, Lille wasn&#8217;t even part of France until a siege by Louis XIV in 1667. Up to then it had been firmly Flemish, within the Duchy of Burgundy. This Belgian influence manifests itself in the architecture of beautiful Vieux-Lille, at Grand&#8217;Place and Place Rihour. See the 16th-century Vieille Bourse, with its Flemish mannerist style, and the neo-Flemish building for the Voix du Nord newspaper. As you wander these cobblestone streets you&#8217;ll be enticed by another Belgian hallmark: The sweet smell of waffles. The cuisine is Flemish too, an nothing beats carbonnade flamande (beef stew) on wintry days. "
Quimper,"In an idyllic green valley where the Steir and Odet Rivers join, this dreamy city is the capital of Brittany&#8217;s Finistère department. You could pass a carefree afternoon simply walking the streets, admiring the 17th century colombage houses or taking in the city from the bridges on the Odet. If you need refreshment after walking these cute, pedestrianised streets, just plonk yourself at a crêperie or bar for a glass of Breton cider. A lot of the architecture is from a time when Quimper generated a lot of wealth through its hand-painted faience ceramics, still sold by many shops in the historic centre. But there&#8217;s an obvious sight you have to tick off: The medieval cathedral with its famous twin spires. "
Arras,"You could come to this city just to see its great squares: The Grand&#8217;Place and the Place des Héros, will tell you almost everything you need to know about Arras. They total 17,000 square metres and have rows of exquisite houses in the Flemish-Baroque style. These are from the 17th and 18th century, and have arcades on the ground floor. You&#8217;ll want to inspect each one closely, as there&#8217;s always a piece of sculpture or other unique feature to meet your gaze. Beneath these squares is a large system of tunnels dug in the sandstone over centuries and used as shelters during the many wars that have beset this part of France. You can explore these, as well as the UNESCO-listed belfry &#8211; if you don&#8217;t mind climbing the 326 steps to the top! "
Honfleur,"Chances are you may already know Honfleur, even if you&#8217;ve never been there. That&#8217;s because the harbour at this seaside town in Normandy has been the subject of paintings by Monet, Courbet, Eugène Boudin, among many others. It&#8217;s an image you need to see for yourself from Quai Saint-Etienn, gazing across at the implausibly narrow old fishing houses, many clad with slate. This isn&#8217;t the only wonder in Honfleur ; another is the all-wood Sainte-Catherine Church, built by ship carpenters in the 16th-century and separated from its equally endearing bell-tower in case of fire. Both were crafted without the use of saws, as the shipbuilders of Honfleurs preferred axes, in a Norman tradition that went back to before William the Conqueror. "
La Roche-Guyon,"On  a bend in the River Seine, La Roche-Guyon is a lovely old settlement at the foot of a château built into a cliff in the 1100s to control the river crossing. It&#8217;s open to the public, and you can get a sense of the ingenuity here, with a keep connected to the lower fortress by tunnels cut from the rock. The view from the tower, and the path on the ridge behind will be the pride of your facebook page! A few minutes away in Giverny is Monet&#8217;s house, which is exactly how the famous artist left it. Even if you&#8217;re not a student of his art you&#8217;ll know many of the scenes in the gardens, which Monet painted many times. "
Amiens,"One building that can&#8217;t be avoided in Amiens, visually or otherwise, is the enormous gothic cathedral. It&#8217;s a World Heritage site, and is one of the largest medieval churches in the world, filled with precious sculpture, both on the jaw-dropping west facade and inside, and with a soaring nave and choir that are flushed with light by the innumerable stained glass windows. There&#8217;s also no denying the charm of the Saint-Leu quarter on the north side of the cathedral. It&#8217;s where much of the city&#8217;s nightlife can be found, in a neighbourhood of little brick or timber houses next to canals. Jules Verne also lived in the city for the last two decades of his life, and his house is now a museum, full of little curiosities to thrill fans of his work. "
Rouen,"A weekend is not nearly enough to see and do everything in Rouen: This city on the Seine is Normandy&#8217;s cultural and historic capital, a historic river port where English kings held court in the middle ages, and where Joan of Arc met her end at just 19. There&#8217;s a new museum to this French heroine in the city, appropriate given the medieval feel of the place. The old quarter is an evocative maze of creaking timber-framed houses ushering you to sights like the Gros Horloge, an astronomical clock from the 1300s, or the cathedral, once the tallest building in the world. Monet famously painted the cathedral in a series of works done in different lights and seasons of the year. "
Saint-Valery-sur-Somme,"Joan of Arc is the thread between Rouen and this seaside commune at the mouth of the Somme in Picardy. She was held here before being dispatched to Rouen for her execution. Saint-Valery was host to a number of interesting events like this because of its strategic position, on a promontory next to the Estuary. The high old quarter, a former citadel, still has its ramparts, and the original gates still mark the entrance to this part of the town. On the water Saint-Valery is equally quaint with a boardwalk that goes on for a couple of kilometres, passing painted fishing cottages and plush old villas, while giving perfect vistas of the Somme Estuary all the way over to Le Crotay on the other side. "
Lyons-la-Forêt,"In Haute Normandie, this small town is surrounded by the kind of idyllic farmland that people dream of when they think of the Norman and Breton countryside. This is known as &#8220;bocage&#8221;, pasture for cattle and orchards bounded by thickets. Lyons-la-Forêt is also one of those classic villages with timber-framed houses, kept almost exactly as it was in the 1600s after it was rebuilt following a fire. What&#8217;s great about Lyons-la-Forêt is that it also feels lived in: The covered marketplace and its wooden columns still shelters market stalls on Thursdays and the shops all around buzz with trade. "
Beuvron-en-Auge,"Normandy is loved for its many towns and villages with half-timbered (colombage) houses, but few are as beautiful as the little village of Beuvon-en-Auge. The star here is a 15th-century manor house, with cream-coloured daub and a jaunty turret on one corner. There&#8217;s a small square where you could sit for a few moments, and every direction you look there&#8217;ll be a charming old house with a cafe, restaurant or village amenities, all decorated with geraniums and other flowers. You&#8217;re in Normandy&#8217;s cider country in Beuvron-en-Auge so there&#8217;s no excuse not to have a glass of cider or Calvados, apple brandy. "
Le Havre,"Where most of Northern France&#8217;s favourite tourist destinations are medieval settlements with ramparts and wooden houses, Le Havre is one for those who appreciate modern architecture. After this port city was badly damaged in the war, the city consulted the architect Auguste Perret whose designs recently earned the city World Heritage status. One that mesmerises all-comers is St. Joseph&#8217;s Church, the 107-metre tower of which is held up only by the concrete&#8217;s internal reinforcement. You can pause beneath this hollow structure, lit by geometric stained glass windows, and just stare in awe! The modernist Hôtel de Ville has a lookout from its gallery, while you&#8217;ll also struggle to miss Oscar Niemeyer&#8217;s Cultural Centre, known as &#8220;The Volcano&#8221;. "
Vannes,"Set in Morbihan, this old city is blessed with nearly all the things people associate with the best of Brittany. It&#8217;s a walled city, with ramparts still in place and enclosing quaint streets and squares with overhanging half-timbered houses. Some of these are five storeys tall, with beams buckled from the weight, and you&#8217;ll be left wondering how they&#8217;re still standing. The suitably grand entrance to old Vannes is the baroque Porte Saint-Vincent, named for the city&#8217;s patron saint. Equally splendid are the Jardins des Remparts, flawless parterres on the west side of the walls. "
Bayeaux,"The first thing many will picture when they think of Bayeaux is the tapestry, and with good reason. It&#8217;s a lasting piece of medieval storytelling, and the purpose-built museum presents it such a way that you can see the individual stitching made almost 1,000 years ago. As you come to the city, the tapestry may dominate your plans, but what dominates the city is the gothic and romanesque cathedral completed in 1077: William the Conqueror was here for the consecration. There are also several sites relevant to the Normandy Invasion in 1944, including the British War Cemetery and the Museum of the Battle of Normandy. "
Reims,"As with Bayeaux you may have only one thing on your mind when you come to this city in Champagne. Most of the most vaunted champagne houses are headquartered in Reims, and nearly all open their doors for walking tours of the caves, and tasting sessions. Reims&#8217; chalky foundations has a part to play in this, as the man-made caves underneath the city provide just the right environment for champagne to ferment in the bottle. Start with Maison Veuve, Clicquot, Tattinger and Lanson, and you&#8217;ll still hardly have popped the cork! In between tastings, you have to spare some time for the cathedral, not least because it was where almost every King of France was crowned. "
Beauvais,"The highlight of this city in Picardy is the exquisite &#8220;unfinished&#8221; cathedral, which would have been the largest building in the world had it been completed. Unfortunately the design was too ambitious and there were fatal structural problems, though it does still contain the highest gothic vault ever built. Around this buildings are lots of intriguing old sights from the 1100s to the 1500s, like the Episcopal palace, which now contains exhibitions about the history of the Oise Department, of which Beauvais is the capital. On Rue de Paris to the south of the city,  spend some time at the Maladerie, a 12th-century hospital for plague and lepers victims, run by monks. "
The Alnwick Castle,"A market town full of poise, Alnwick has terraces of limestone flat-fronted townhouses with second-hand bookshops, coffee shops and pubs. The big sight is the town&#8217;s castle, which is the second-largest inhabited castle in the UK, after Windsor. You&#8217;re free to poke around in the summer, and there&#8217;s extra incentive for Harry Potter fans as the property was Hogwarts in the movies. You&#8217;ll also be spellbound by The Alnwick Garden, landscaped hedges and flowerbeds around a water cascade. To arouse morbid curiosity there&#8217;s a Poison Garden growing hemlock, foxglove and the plants to make ricin and strychnine. Also, make excursions to the castles at Chillingham, Edlingham and Dunstanburgh and to experience the awesome beachscapes at Low Newton and Embleton Bay. "
Berwick-upon-Tweed,"England&#8217;s northernmost town is a couple of miles short of the Scottish border at the mouth of the Tweed. You&#8217;re left in no doubt that this community has been wrested from both English and Scottish grasp down the centuries. When Richard I captured Berwick from the Scots in the 1300s he built the town walls, which were adapted to withstand artillery in the 1500s during Elizabeth I&#8217;s reign. Most of these defences are still here, which is very rare for English towns. There&#8217;s much more to see, from the three sandy beaches to the Tweed Estuary, crossed by Stevenson&#8217;s imposing Royal Border Railway Bridge. The Berwick Barracks date to the early-1700s, at the time of the Jacobite risings and have enthralling exhibits about the last conflict fought on British soil. "
Lindisfarne,"This beautiful, mysterious and ancient island can be reached on foot via an ancient route known as the Pilgrim&#8217;s Way, but obviously you&#8217;ll need to keep an eye on the tide times before you set off. At Lindisfarne you&#8217;ll encounter a priory that was first established in the 600s and then resurrected by the Normans a few centuries later. At this site you&#8217;ll be going back to the earliest years of Christianity in Britain, but also the English language, as a biography of the 7th-century St Cuthbert is the oldest surviving English text. The English Heritage centre has astounding Celtic religious carvings, and recounts the violent Viking raids that wrecked the island in the 800s. "
Northumberland National Park,"The least-inhabited national park in England encompasses 400 square miles of remote uplands littered with abandoned historic sites. In the north are the Fleck Towers, small fortresses standing as watchtowers and beacons in the Scottish Marches in the middle ages. And slicing across the south is the bulk of Hadrian&#8217;s Wall, with fragments of the forts that were stationed every few miles along the route. Meanwhile, walkers, horse-riders, mountain bikers and anyone else aching for peaceful open spaces can fill their boots in this far-off land. At night the skies are darker in the park than anywhere else in the country, another happy consequence of the lack of large settlements and literally heavenly for stargazers and amateur astronomers. "
Hexham Abbey,"If you want to know more about Northumberland in Roman times, you couldn&#8217;t pick a better place than Hexham, which is directly on the wall. The only trouble will be knowing where to start, as the forts in this part of the county, like Vindolanda, Cilurnum and Housesteads, are in good condition considering their antiquity. The Roman Army museum adds another layer of interest and the Temple of Mithras at Carrawburgh is a reminder of just how much activity there was in this land 2,000 years ago. Newer but no less enthralling is Hexham Abbey, with Early English Gothic architecture from the 12th century. Go below to investigate the crypt built entirely with Roman stones that still bear their ancient inscriptions. "
Seahouses,"On the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Seahouses is an uncommonly pretty fishing village with a working port. Many of your activities will be centred on the handsome harbour, where you can climb aboard boats for seal-spotting trips or adventures to the Farne Islands just offshore. And after all that crisp sea air you can retire to the warmth one of the village&#8217;s inns for a pint and meal. There are sand dunes and enormous sandy beaches both up and down the coast, and if you&#8217;ve ever fancied horseback riding you can saddle up for a ride here by the water in the most romantic setting imaginable. "
Morpeth,"A cultivated town in the south of the county, Morpeth has kept hold of most of its historical buildings. Among them is the clock tower from the 1600s and Morpeth Chantry, a 13th-centruy chapel that holds the tourist information centre. Harmonising with the elegant townscape is the Sanderson Arcade, a shopping gallery that looks like it could be 100 years old but was completed just a few years ago. Young ones can make some animal friends at Eshott Heugh Animal Park and the Whitehouse Farm Centre, while there&#8217;s culture too at Belsay Hall and Wallington, two acclaimed country piles minutes outside the town. "
Bamburgh,"Also in the Northumbria AONB, Bamburgh draws holidaymakers for St Aiden Beach, hilly sand dunes and an exceptional castle. This mighty landmark stands on a volcanic plateau and was the throne of the Norse Kings of Northumbria, boasting medieval Norman architecture, but with a tale that begins as far back as the 400s. There&#8217;s another angle to Bamburgh&#8217;s allure: The village has a museum for a Victorian resident, Grace Darling who was the daughter of the Longstone Lighthouse keeper on the rocks off the coast. In 1838 she helped rescue nine people from the wreck of the Forfarshire paddle steamer, becoming a national folk hero in the process. "
Kielder Observatory,"In the county&#8217;s remotest western fringe, the village of Kielder is about as far as you can be from civilisation in England. And yet despite (and because of) this remoteness there&#8217;s a great deal going on. Near the crest of Black Fell, Kielder Observatory is an Eldorado for amateur astronomers, and if you&#8217;re new to the science there are even volunteers to show you how to use the telescopes. In the village, Kielder Castle is actually a hunting lodge constructed by the Duke of Northumberland in 1775, but has an informative visitor centre. And for total seclusion there&#8217;s Kielder Forest Park, which was only planted in the 1950s when it became the largest man-made forest in Europe at 250 square miles in size. "
Warkworth,"On the southern cusp of the Northumberland AONB, Amble is a cute old seaport where the Coquet empties into the North Sea. Nature-lovers arrive in summer for cruises to Coquet Island, when 35,000 puffins jostle for space to make their nests. The cute waterside village of Warkworth has a boundless sandy beach, as well as a tremendous landmark in Warkworth Castle. During the Anglo-Scottish Wars in the 14th century this was a much-coveted stronghold and came under siege twice by the Scots. And if you&#8217;re willing to go the extra mile you can go on a quest to discover Warkworth Hermitage, a medieval chapel that is cut from the cliffs on the Coquet and can only be reached by boat. "
Corbridge,"Right away something that might excite you about Corbridge is that many of the buildings are made from recycled Roman stone from the abandoned town of Corstopitum. You can go and see what&#8217;s left of this garrison, which is still one of the most complete archaeological sites on Hadrian&#8217;s wall, and furnished with information boards to bring the foundations to life. There&#8217;s medieval history to uncover at Aydon Castle, a medieval manor house that owes its defensive appearance to centuries of conflict along the Scottish border. Put the first weekend in June in your diary, for the Corbridge Festival, which has street theatre, market stalls, a real ale talent competition and an excellent lineup of live music. "
heritage colliery at Woodhorn,"Up to the 1840s Ashington was little more than a hamlet, but the area&#8217;s coal seams were soon exploited and the town grew to become one of the largest settlements in Northumberland. This being a working town the blockbuster attraction is the heritage colliery at Woodhorn, moments east of Ashington. Very little of this turn-of-the-century mine has been altered, and the winding house, towering headframes, engine house and a great ensemble of original outbuildings are as good as new. For smaller visitors there&#8217;s the Woodhorn Railway, that uses two locomotives that had industrial uses, one at the Seaham Colliery and another at the Channel Tunnel. "
Alesund,Alesund is on a narrow peninsula on the west coast and is considered the gateway to the majestic northwestern fjords and alpine mountains.  It’s home base for the countries massive cod-fishing fleet and is considered by all who visit to be a picturesque and quintessential Scandinavian town.  Alesund is built entirely in the Jugendstil art nouveau style of architecture after a fire in 1904. You can visit Jugendstilsenteret (Art Nouveau Centre) to learn more about this brick and stone style.  You can also take a quick hike up the 400 steps to Fjellstua lookout point to see absolutely amazing views of the mountains and nearby islands. 
Tromso,"This is northern Norway’s largest city and is best known for the 18th century wooden houses and the gorgeous natural surroundings. Located on Tromsoya, one of many islands in the region, are beautiful forests to ramble through and the Fjellheisen cable car trip to the top of Storsteinen is highly recommended. Visit historical and cultural spots like the Polar Museum and Polaria &#8211; the arctic aquarium.  And for those seeking the glory of the northern lights, Tromso is one of the best places to see them. "
Trondheim,"The third largest city in Norway serves as a perfect base for exploring the surrounding region. Trondheim has many faces – it’s known for culture, technology, students, food, and cycling! The city hosts year-round festivals like the St. Olav Festival – the largest cultural and church event in the country. It’s been called an “intimate big city,” which captures the modern and energetic atmosphere but also lets visitors know that history has not been forgotten. Trondheim was the country’s capital during the Viking era and you can visit places like Sverresborg castle (12th century) and the Nidaros Cathedral – a pilgrimage site for almost 1000 years. Don’t forget the farmer’s market, the excellent restaurants, and the incredibly local breweries. "
Jotunheimen National Park,"As the Home Of The Giants, Jotunheimen is Norway’s leading national park. The park is located in the south centre of the country and covers several mountain ranges; include the 29 highest peaks in all of Norway. There are hundreds of hiking routes that take you to fantastic glaciers, clear deep woodland lakes, and to panoramic valleys.  At least one of them will take you to Vettisfossen, the highest waterfall in Norway (275m). The park is always busy with adventure seeking fun-lovers and tour companies will put together some incredible packages that showcase the best of what this well-loved park has to offer. "
Svalbard,"Svalbard means “cold coasts” and this small group of islands is known as the home of the polar bear.  Located in the Arctic Ocean between Norway and the North Pole, this is the northernmost spot that is permanently inhabited. Untouched arctic wilderness combined with rare and unusual wildlife creates an environment that is rugged and fascinating to travellers. The majority of people live (and visit) Longyearbyen, which is the largest settlement in the archipelago. It’s a tiny yet energetic town that has grown from a traditional village into a surprisingly modern place complete with festivals, exhibitions, concerts, and other cultural activities. For the adventurer, this is the place to see striking craggy mountains, untouched glaciers, polar bears, reindeer, caribou, whales, walruses, and more. "
Oslo,"As one of Europe’s fastest growing cities, the atmosphere in Oslo is confident, modern, and relaxed. It’s a cosmopolitan destination with world-class restaurants, and art galleries, but still manages to make you feel like you’re in a much smaller town. Sitting just inside the “U-shaped” Oslofjord, Oslo is two-thirds forest and green space which make this the perfect spot for biking and hiking. Olso is Norway’s capital and home, not just to the royal family, but to major cultural establishments like National Theatre and the National Museum of Art, the Nobel Peace Centre, The Munch Museum (Edvward Munch’s The Scream is housed in the permanent collection), and the Norwegian Opera and Ballet. A must-see is Folkemuseet, an interactive outdoor museum that features 150 historic buildings like the famous Stave Church. "
Stavanger,"This town is different from the majority in Norway because of the sandy beaches and warmer climate.  Stavanger is the preferred summer destination for travellers who want a taste of Scandinavia mixed with sand and surf. Because of its location in the southwest of the country, the harbour here is a major stopping point for tours and cruise ships.   You’ll want to see Rogaland Kunstmuseum which has a fantastic collection of Norwegian art, as well as the country’s best example of a medieval church, the Stavanger Cathedral.  In the Gamel Stavanger district you’ll slip back in time to explore 18th century Scandinavia at its best. "
Lofoten Islands,"It’s a bit unbelievable just how beautiful the Lofoten Islands are. Best known among those who prefer to go off the beaten trail and get personal with Mother Nature, this wonderful wilderness outpost highlights untouched landscapes of deep fjords, grand mountain ranges, unique colonies of seabirds, and exquisite beaches. Though it’s located at about the same latitude as Greenland, the climate in this archipelago is rather mild thanks to the Gulf Stream. If you want a truly unforgettable experience in nature, Lofoten is your place.  You can kayak between the islands, surf, fish, scuba dive, go ocean rafting, hike, ski, and more. Don’t forget to check out some of the oldest Viking relics in the entire country. "
Bergen,"Bergen is the second largest city after Oslo and is considered to be the gateway to the fjords. It’s an appealing mixture of living history as Bryggen, the 15th century waterfront, is a major modern port for Norway as well as a popular tourist destination. Here you’ll find small-town values and atmosphere as locals happily direct you to the best meal in town (in their opinion!). There are seven mountains that surround the city which lead to lovely views no matter where you are. Enjoy the fish market at Hanseatic Wharf and after you explore the town, head out to explore the most breathtaking fjords in Norway.. "
Naeroyfjord,"It’s true that there are remarkable fjords all over Norway and all of them worth seeing.  But, the most famous and awe-inspiring are found in West Norway between Molde and Stavanger. The Western Fjords are home to both ancient and modern glaciers and deep sea drenched valleys that are marked by rocky terrain. The two you don’t want to miss are Naeroyfjord and Geirangerfjord. Because of this beauty, this entire area is one of the most unique and sought-after destinations on the planet. And although you’ll go for the fjords, you’ll also fall in love with the sublime coast.  Travel around by ferry, where you’ll get the truly spectacular views, and enjoy trekking through forests and across glaciers. "
Bodø,"Bodø offers a lively urban atmosphere and serves as the starting point to the true north of Norway – specifically the Lofoten Islands. You can tour the archipelago on a tourist speed boat, kayak at midnight when the sun is still out, or fish in the incredibly strong tidal currents of Saltstraumen. The town itself, with the northern lights at your fingertips, has much to discover. Concerts in city park, shopping at charming boutique shops, cocktails on the quay with sea eagles soaring across the ocean, and the well-preserved trading post at Kjærringøy are all a part of this laid-back town. If you’re travelling in August, enjoy Nordland Musikkfestuke and Parkenfestivalen, Bodø’s two major music festivals. "
Fredrikstad,"With a population of around 350, Fredrikstad is a quaint town with significant historical roots. Though much of Norway is cold for much of the year, the warmth of the locals is so sincere, that you won’t feel the temperature as much!  Home to the most well-preserved fortress in all of Scandinavia, Fredrikstad dates back to the 16th century and has a ton of history to discover.  Old town is a popular and charming spot for tourists.  You can relax over a bottle of wine or an Italian coffee before heading out to the Fredrikstad Museum, or one of many art galleries or shops in the market. The nearby Hvaler Islands are, geographically speaking, the sunniest part in Norway.  In the summer, domestic tourists love this region for a relaxing getaway and to explore Ytre Hvaler National Park. "
Alta,"Perhaps the best Norwegian destination to view the northern lights, Alta has a ton of activates you’ll enjoy. For starters, try a snow mobile safari or dog sledding. The first ever observatory for the northern lights was built here at the end of the 19th century. Popular attractions include the UNESCO Word Heritage designated rock carvings of the Sami culture (dating to 4200 to 500 BC) and the Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel (yes, all interiors and exterior are made of snow). The climate is mild but because of its extreme north location, Alta has 24 hours of daylight from May to August each year and “blue season” is from November to January. Take in the Alta Fjord, coasts, and mountains while you enjoying biking, hiking, and fishing in this dazzling town. "
Røros,"Founded in 1644, Røros is an important mining town entirely made up of wooden buildings. It’s grown into a modern community even as it maintains its historical status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Because it still has so much of its original character, it feels like you’re visiting a living museum. Take a stroll through old courtyards and narrow streets where you’ll find craftsmen selling locally made clothing, ceramics, and delicious food. Named a Sustainable Destination in 2013, Røros is committed to reducing its tourism footprint and maintaining its history and quality experience for guests. "
Helgeland,"With so much natural beauty and top-quality outdoor adventure in Norway it’s no small feat that Helgeland stands out as distinctive in this area.  Explore countless white sand beaches on countless pristine islands when you visit the Vega archipelago, just off Helgoland’s coast. Island hop with a kayak or a bike through this UNESCO-protected area.  If you’re a bird watcher, you’ll have the chance to spot over 200 species in Lånan, including sea eagles and eider ducks. Each April locals help the ducks prepare the nesting site and after nesting season is over, they harvest the down in order to make their famous high-quality duvets. While there make a visit to Svartisen, the second largest glacier in the country and enjoy a long hike across the surface. "
Nottingham,"Among England&#8217;s top-ten picks for a city break, Nottingham has the shops, dining, entertainment and culture that you demand of a historic destination. The revamped centre has been pedestrianised and is a breeze to get around on foot. Nottingham also has the kind of attractions that don&#8217;t come along very often, like the Galleries of Justice, which gives you the chance to tour a Victorian gaol and courtroom, where people were sentenced and executed. The City of Caves invites you to explore the 1,000-year-old man-made tunnels below the city centre, while Wollaton Hall is a spellbinding Elizabethan palace that has been wowing visitors since 1580. "
Newark-on-Trent Castle,"In the east of the county, not far from the boundary with Lincolnshire, Newark is a town that many students of English history will recognise from the civil war in the 17th century. During Britain&#8217;s deadliest conflict Newark was a royalist stronghold, and the base of their power was Newark castle, which is in good shape remembering that it was partially destroyed and  left to crumble after the war ended. In the centre of the town at Appleton Gate is the National Civil War Centre, that will walk you through the causes and pivotal events in this conflict, while there&#8217;s also a Civil War trail around this handsome old town pointing you to the many riveting sites. "
Southwell Minster,"In what may well be Nottinghamshire&#8217;s loveliest town, the showpiece in Southwell is the wonderful Norman and gothic Minster. The pair of western towers are held as one of England&#8217;s romanesque masterpieces, while the 14th-century choir screen is also a marvel for its dainty traceries. Southwell saw vicious fighting in the Civil War and landmarks like the Minster and Episcopal Palace bear 400-year-old damage from this conflict. As you potter around these streets with local shops and pubs in flat-fronted and timber-framed houses, keep the Saracen&#8217;s Head in mind. This inn was where King Charles I spent his last night of freedom in 1647 and the end of the war. "
Mansfield Market Square,"If you know and love the works of D.H. Lawrence you can see a slice of industrial Nottinghamshire described in novels like Sons and Lovers around Mansfield. A brief drive west is the Pleasley Colliery, which operated up to 1983 and since then has been cleaned up and conserved as a museum. The Victorian engine house, chimney stack and headstocks are a part of the region&#8217;s legacy that has almost disappeared. A sightseeing tour of Mansfield will focus on Market Place, where the town&#8217;s 700-year-old market sets up. In the 1800s this was moved from the Buttercross to the west, which was marked by a stone pillar in the 1500s. "
Major Oak,"Everybody has heard of Sherwood Forest from the Robin Hood tales, but what you may not know is that Sherwood was actually known as Birklands and Bilhaugh in medieval times. This was a vast royal hunting forest that spread into several counties and covered a quarter of modern Nottinghamshire&#8217;s territory. Some 430 hectares of heath and woodland of birch, pines and oak have been preserved outside the village of Edwinstowe. The county is keen to play up the Robin Hood angle, putting on the medieval-themed Robin Hood Festival in August, with jousts, minstrels and markets. Any other time be sure to see the ancient Major Oak, cited as one of England&#8217;s natural wonders and dated to the 11th century. "
Mr Straw&#8217;s House,"On the northern side of the Sherwood Forest, Worksop is also bounded by a district of stately  homes known as the Dukeries, which we&#8217;ll come to next. One of the most compelling attractions in Worksop is a slightly more modest building: Mr Straw&#8217;s House. This is an ordinary Edwardian home that was bequeathed to two brothers when their parents passed away in the 1930s. It remained untouched for the next 60 years until it was opened as a National Trust property in the 1990s and serves as a perfect time capsule of a middle class family in Edwardian times. Outside Worksop you can hike through Creswell Crags, a limestone gorge with caves inhabited by prehistoric humans. These dwellings have the most northerly examples of cave art in Europe. "
Thoresby Hall,"It doesn&#8217;t get finer than this district in the northwest of the county, where four ducal estates are found close together just south of Worksop. So if grand houses and country gardens are up your alley the Dukeries should be in your plans. The trouble with Worksop Manor, Clumber House, Thoresby Hall and Welbeck Abbey is picking just one or two to visit, because they all have something  to recommend them, whether it&#8217;s history full of intrigue or beautiful walled kitchen gardens. Another property, Rufford Abbey, wasn&#8217;t a ducal seat, but is part of the trail, having been turned into a country house after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1500s. "
Open Field &#8211; Laxton,"Far from Nottinghamshire&#8217;s main roads and motorways, Laxton would be any other sleepy country village, but for a system of land management that is straight out of the medieval period. Laxton has the last open field system in Europe, where the village&#8217;s three fields are divided into strips and farmed by different landowners. It&#8217;s not easy to explain, but there&#8217;s a heritage centre at the Dovecote pub in the village explaining everything you need to know. Just north of Laxton you can make out the earthworks of what used to be Laxton Castle, a Norman motte and bailey fortress from around the start of the early-1200s. "
Tuxford &#8211; St Nicholas,"An idyllic village with a peculiar history, Tuxford was once vital to the transport system in the East Midlands. It is on the Great North Road, a coaching route that ran from Smithfield Market in London to Newcastle. Today the A1 road traces much of this route. Tuxford was a coaching town, where stagecoaches would change mounts or where people travelling cross country would spend the night. You don&#8217;t need to look hard to see signs of this role: The Museum of the Horse is in a former coach house and tells you all about the history of horse-drawn transport in England. Unmissable in the countryside just north of the village is the Tuxford Windmill, which still mills flour for you to buy, and has a sweet tearoom in its outbuilding. "
Chesterfield Canal &#8211; Retford,"In the county&#8217;s northernmost reaches, Retford is a distinguished market town centred on a large market square with regal Georgian townhouses and little shopping streets that invite you to see what you can discover. If the Town Hall on the square looks a little out of place, that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s slightly newer than the buildings around it, and was built in Victorian times in the French renaissance style. The littlest holidaymakers will be crazy about Sundown Adventureland, an acclaimed amusement park aimed exclusively at u10s. And for grown-ups there&#8217;s the Bassetlaw Museum where you can investigate the ties between northern Nottinghamshire and the USA. "
St. Wilfrid&#8217;s Church &#8211; Scrooby,"A rather large number of the people who were on the Mayflower for its momentous voyage to America in 1620 came from a couple of villages just west of Retford. People like William Brewster were Brownists, who were disaffected with the Anglican Church and wanted to make further reforms on top of the ones that had taken place in the previous hundred years. So for anyone who&#8217;d like to unearth the very roots of America you could spend some time visiting All Saints&#8217; Church in Babworth and St Wilfrid&#8217;s in Scrooby where Separatist ideas were first shared. "
St Mary Magdalene &#8211; Hucknall,"Just five miles apart, in Nottinghamshire&#8217;s mining region, are two towns associated with three of the most influential figures of the 19th and 20th centuries. Start with the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, which is where the Bryon family vault is found. So not only is the romantic writer Lord Byron interred here, but also his daughter Ada Lovelace, who is considered the first computer programmer. Then, Eastwood is where  the early-20th-century novelist D. H. Lawrence was born in 1885: His first home is the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum and has everyday items belonging to what was a working class mining family. "
Kelham Hall,"After that last night of freedom in Southwell in 1647, Charles I surrendered and was duly brought to Kelham Hall where he was held by the Scots. Kelham Hall is a Grade I property that got a gothic-revival facelift in the 19th century. Today the estate is a 20-hectare country park, with pristine gardens and even a campsite by the River Trent if you&#8217;d like to stay a night or two in summer. The Hall meanwhile is hired out for events like weddings, but you can call in at the tea rooms for a cuppa in a location imbued with a riveting history. "
"East Markham, St John the Baptist church","In the Bassetlaw district, East Markham is a small and very peaceful village with not much more than a single pub. A strange characteristic here is that the Parish Church of St John the Baptist is on the southern edge of East Markham and not surrounded by it. The explanation for this is that the entire village was shifted during medieval times because of plague. As the village is nestled in a conservation area, East Markham has some of Nottinghamshire&#8217;s most pleasing countryside, a patchwork of orchards, vegetable and cereal farms crossed by remote country lanes, footpaths and bridleways. "
"The Square, Gotham","We know you&#8217;ve heard this name somewhere before. Well the relationship between an idyllic village in Nottinghamshire and Batman&#8217;s city isn&#8217;t as coincidental as you might think. DC&#8217;s Gotham is named after New York, and New York got the complimentary nickname &#8220;Gotham&#8221; in the early 19th century from the writer Washington Irving. He recalled a famous story about residents of the original Gotham&#8217;s ingenuity in medieval times, in which they feigned madness (then believed to be contagious) to avoid having the king&#8217;s road built through the village, and so avoiding all the obligations that came with it. And as for the name&#8217;s meaning, it&#8217;s &#8220;Goat&#8217;s Home&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t sound so glamorous! "
Corkscrew Falls In Ohio&#8217;s Hocking Hills Region,"Hocking Hills is made up of cliffs, rock shelters, gorges and water falls.

Mount Hood, one of the seven wonders of Oregon, is home to a wide range of hiking trails, while there is also skiing, snowboarding and climbing available.

The Haystack Rocks,"The Haystack Rocks are one of Oregon&#8217;s most incredible natural phenomenons.

Alvord Desert,"Alvord Desert is perhaps the most magical place in Oregon, with the area home to incredibly rare light shows &#8211; known as The Happening as they are so far unexplained &#8211; that some photographers have been fortunate enough to witness. The desert itself is flat enough to drive across during the driest periods, while the area is also known for being where Kitty O&#8217;Neil set an unofficial women&#8217;s world land speed in 1976. Visitors to the desert have also been known to spot wild horses at springs, drinking in water at the eastern edge of the desert.

The Misery Ridge Hiking trail also takes visitors to Smith Rock, which is another of the seven wonders of Oregon. "
Sweet Creek Trail,"The Sweet Creek Trail is an easy 2.2-mile trip that takes in around a dozen beautiful waterfalls.

The trail is found only a few miles inland from Florence, at the mouth of the Siuslaw River. "
Wallowa Mountains,"Found in the Columbia Plateau in northeastern Oregon, the Wallowa Mountains boast perhaps the most varied and beautiful sights in the whole state. Another of the seven wonders of Oregon, the Wallowas are perhaps best experienced by riding a horse to the summit, but there is also the option of taking a gondola for a spectacular trip from Wallowa Lake Village all the way up to the peak of Mount Howard.

Yaquina Head Light And Cliffs,"The tallest lighthouse in the state, Yaquina Head Light used to be known as Cape Foulweather Lighthouse and can be found close to the mouth of the Yaquina River, near the city of Newport. The lighthouse is famous for its appearance in the 2002 film The Ring, when it stood in as the Moesko Island Lighthouse. Tours of the lighthouse are available and visitors should also take time to take a walk along the cliffs at Yaquina Head, although the weather here can be unpredictable &#8211; hence the extremely honest former name of the lighthouse. "
Cape Meares,"Cape Meares is highly popular with tourists who are travelling along the Three Capes Scenic route. Cape Meares itself, which is close to the city of Tillamook, is named after British explorer John Meares. The cape, a headland located over 200 feet above the ocean, is a great place to visit for wildlife enthusiasts, as it is home to nesting common murres.

Oxford,"At the oldest English-speaking university in the world, you should begin with a tour of the various colleges clustered around centre of the city. Most of these have wonderful architecture, and if you time your trip right you&#8217;ll be able to go inside. Christ Church, Magdalen College and Queens&#8217; College are vital, as is the 17th-century Bodleian Library. And with an internationally-respected university comes museums and cultural attractions that are a cut above: The Ashmolean, the Pitt Rivers Museum, the Museum of Natural History, all are world-class. After that there&#8217;s the Thames, which is still shallow this far upstream, so the best way to get around on the water is by punting. "
Henley-on-Thames,"A very genteel town in the far southeast of the county, Henley is synonymous with the regatta that makes a splash in the social calendar at the turn of July. Thousands of spectators crowd the grassy banks for rowing events entered by both seasoned Olympians and crews new to competitive rowing. At other times you can simply bask in Henley&#8217;s refined character and go for strolls in the meadows and wooden Chiltern hillsides that climb up from the river. The sublime Tudor country house and National Trust attraction, Greys Court, is on the edge of town and has appeared in TV shows like Downton Abbey. Also suitably plush is Nuffield Place, once the home of the car manufacturer William Morris. "
"Burford, England","On the steep sides of the Windrush Valley, Burford is seen as Oxfordshire&#8217;s &#8220;Gateway to the Cotswolds&#8221;. Burford&#8217;s stiff slopes make it somehow more picturesque, especially when you see town&#8217;s rustic stone cottages, half-timbered buildings and regal townhouses on the high street. Wandering down towards the medieval bridge on the Windrush River you&#8217;ll be enticed by the little side streets, which have tea rooms, pubs and specialty shops. And if you&#8217;d like to spend the night there&#8217;s a good choice of bed &amp; breakfasts and inns for such a small town. Allow some time to see the medieval Church of St John the Baptist, which is lavish in the true Wool Church style. "
Witney,"Like a few of the former weaving towns in Oxford, Witney is often placed among the best places to live in Britain. The market square makes a very persuasive case, with its graceful period architecture and  17th-century Butter Cross, where local women once gathered to sell butter and eggs. Across the street is the early-18th century town hall, made with that fetching Cotswold stone. For some local flavour come by the Wychwood Brewery on weekends to be shown around and to taste the much-loved Hobgoblin brown ale. And then at Cogges, right next to Witney, is a working Victorian manor farm that has also been a shoot location for Downton Abbey. "
Wantage,"The most famous son of Wantage has to be King Alfred the Great who was born here in 849 and ruled the Kingdom of Wessex until 899. There&#8217;s a statue of him in the middle of the market place, sculpted by Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a cousin of Queen Victoria. Wantage is a very sociable place to be on Friday and Saturday evenings in summer, when its many pubs and restaurants around the market are especially animated. Wednesdays and Saturdays are market days, and you should also browse the Vale and Downland Museum, which is set in a 17th-century clothmaker&#8217;s house. "
Abingdon,"On the Thames  a few miles downriver from Oxford, Abingdon is a large, thriving town with some very imposing architecture in its centre. Abingdon County Hall from 1670 is very grand, with tall arcades that would have provided a sophisticated space for markets and meetings. Now it&#8217;s a handy spot to have a quick cup of tea. Abingdon Bridge has spanned the Thames since 1416, despite needing running repairs down the centuries. The defunct Abingdon Abbey is enclosed in a lovely park in the town, and although the abbey church is long gone you can still identify the monastic buildings, including the Long Gallery, an evocative half-timbered hall. "
Blenheim Palace,"This dignified market town has historical links to nobility and royalty, as Woodstock Manor was the birthplace of the eldest son of King Edward III and was where Queen Mary I was imprisoned for a time by Elizabeth I. The Oxfordshire Museum can fill you in on the town&#8217;s fabled history, while the plush centre of Woodstock more than merits a saunter for its regal townhouses, clad with ivy and wisteria. But the biggest attraction around Woodstock is the UNESCO-listed Blenheim Palace, and what could be the most prestigious country house in Britain. One of the few monuments to be built in the briefly-fashionable English baroque style at the start of the 18th-century, the palace was the seat of the Churchill Family and birthplace of the statesman Winston Churchill in 1874. "
Wallingford,"Everything you could need in Wallingford is on hand at the town&#8217;s marketplace. This is the site of Wallingford&#8217;s most memorable landmarks, like the neoclassical Corn Exchange, the glorious arcaded town hall from the 1600s and the Norman church of St Mary-le-More. You can also come to the tourist information centre for leaflets about Wallingford&#8217;s heritage trail, which touches on the Saxon era when the town was a vital fortification for Alfred the Great. Wallingford Castle, built by the Normans, was one of the south&#8217;s most powerful strongholds until it was torn down in the Civil War and left as the ethereal crumbling ruin that remains today. "
Chipping Norton,"Although it&#8217;s just a small town, most people in the UK know about Chipping Norton for the &#8220;Chipping Norton Set&#8221;. A loose association of local movers and shakers including the former Prime Minister David Cameron, the Murdoch Family and the former editor of the Sun newspaper. Besides this connection Chipping Norton is a very charming place, well-known for its antiques shops, and being up in the Cotswolds it&#8217;s also the highest town in the whole of Oxfordshire. St Mary the Virgin is a quintessential Cotswold church and is flooded with light inside because of its uninterrupted clerestory windows. In the verdant countryside outside the town are the Rollright Stones, a Neolithic and Bronze Age stone circle. "
Faringdon Town Hall,"An adorable historic market town southwest of Oxford, Faringdon has much more going for it than you might expect for settlement of this size. In the centre, the Town Hall is the standout sight, dating to the 1600s and still a cornerstone of daily life. For all its serenity today, Faringdon Hill to the east has seen some big events, like battles in the succession crisis known as &#8220;The Anarchy&#8221; in the 12th century and again during the English Civil War when the Republicans had a fortress. Today the hill is topped with a 43-metre-high folly from 1935, with a neo-gothic design and giving you great views of the Vale of the White Horse. Also check out the 14th-century Great Coxwell Barn, and the Uffington White Horse, a chalk hill figure fashioned some 3,000 years ago. "
Banbury,"More of a working town than many of the destinations on this list, Banbury, in the far north of Oxfordshire, has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. This flourishing town attracts shoppers from miles around, and the pedestrianised centre with its fair share of history is the right location a wander. Banbury is also a springboard for the fantastic heritage in the area. There are three resplendent country houses: Sulgrave Manor, Upton House and Broughton Castle, all worthy of a detour. To pick one, Broughton Castle is a medieval fortified manor house that was extended in Elizabethan times  and has a magical walled garden. "
Bicester,"This historic market town is expanding quickly, building new homes for commuters working in London and Oxford. But Bicester is much more than just a bedroom community, as the fabulous architecture around the marketplace will show you, including gorgeous 17th-century townhouses and a smattering of older half-timbered buildings. But for many holidaymakers the town&#8217;s reputation is founded squarely on Bicester Village, an outlet mall that pulls in a staggering 6.3 million shoppers a year. More visitors from China come these luxury outlets than to any other attraction in the country apart from Buckingham Palace! "
Minster Lovell Hall,"A very small bundle of villages and hamlets in the west of the county, Minster Lovell may be an unassuming sort of place now, but in the middle ages one of England&#8217;s richest men called the shots from this place. Minster Lovell Hall is run by English Heritage, maintaining the beautiful ruins of a late-medieval manor house built for the Baron of Lovell and Holland. The building has been abandoned since the 1700s and the whole site is framed by the River Windrush and its picnic-friendly banks. Photographers and antiquarians won&#8217;t want to leave, but there are a couple pubs in the village to put a cap on a perfect day out. "
Thame,"Oxfordshire specialises in well-heeled market towns, and Thame is one of the prettiest. In its distant past it was a fortified town in the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex, and now it&#8217;s a very comfortable place to pass a few hours. Traditional amenities like butchers, bakers, tea rooms and pubs share Thame with posher boutiques and eateries. Be here on Tuesdays for what many agree is Oxfordshire&#8217;s best outdoor market, likened to an outdoor delicatessen, with local fruit and vegetables, cakes, chutneys  and a host of other home-made delights. "
Didcot Railway Centre,"In a county stereotyped for its refined towns and twee villages, Didcot swings the other way and is a gritty railway town that coalesced around Brunel&#8217;s Great Western Railway in the mid-1800s. For decades the cooling towers of the Didcot Power Station have been a landmark identifiable from miles around, but with hi-tech industries and research centres moving in and the power station being decommissioned, Didcot is now all about innovation. For tourists though, the Didcot Railway Centre is just the ticket if you&#8217;d like to relive the halcyon days of steam locomotives. The attraction is based in a massive engine shed, with more than 30 locomotives, four of which are operational on then museum&#8217;s a heritage line. "
Asuncion,"A curious metropolis of more than two million people, Asuncion is the beating political, economic and cultural heart of modern Paraguay. The center clings to the eastern banks of the Paraguay River, which meanders around the downtown along the border with Argentina to the west. Here, visitors delve into what is – believe it or not – actually one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Americas. First raised by the conquistadores, Asuncion was actually the base from which the Spanish ventured out westwards, to the wilds of Peru and Patagonia. Today, the town is gilded with the great National Pantheon of the Heroes, along with one throbbing nightlife along up-and-coming Paseo Carmelitas. "
Encarnacion,"The so-called ‘Pearl of the South’ reclines carefree on the banks of the Parana River, drawing crowds of Asuncenos (people from the capital) during the summer with the promise of pristine riparian beaches and the country’s most up-and-coming boardwalk boulevard. The best sands are found at the end of Curupayty, groomed and managed and dotted with bikini-clad fashionistas and sunbathers alike. Water sports are popular too, with jet skis buzzing around the meanders of Parana, below the shimmering high-rises of the city’s all-new residential neighbourhoods across the bay. And when the relaxation is done and dusted, be sure to get a culture hit at the UNESCO-attested Jesuit ruins on the edge of the town. "
Cerro Cora National Park,"This pint-sized natural reserve is unquestionably one of the most dramatic and breathtaking sections of backcountry in all of Paraguay. Only recently established, it encompasses a great swathe of undulating savannah and highland terrain, where otherworldly hills peak above the swaying grasses and mosquitoes buzz around the shuffling carapaces of armadillos. Muralia peak is a great place to start here; offering sweeping panoramas of the region’s arid forestry and plains, while there are also curious cultural encounters to be had with the indigenous tribespeople and a smattering of mysterious ancient petroglyphs to evoke the curiosity. "
Ciudad del Este,"Like a Moroccan bazaar, the markets of Ciudad del Este sprawl out along the courses of the Parana River, the sounds of Middle Eastern hagglers and Taiwanese electronics hawkers echoing between the rows and rows of blinking electronics and branded clothes. Yes sir, there’s a reason why this unashamed hub of the Paraguayan black market is hailed as the ‘Supermarket of the Americas’. Thousands of Brazilians cross over to the town every day to catch bargains amidst the emporiums of Camilo Recalde, while visitors typically make a beeline for the colossal engineering masterpiece that is the Itaipu Dam – another of Paraguay’s major economic generators. "
Ybycui National Park,"Capuchin monkeys swing through the canopies while howlers scale the tree trunks at Ybycui National Park, a small and tight-knit protected section of what’s remaining of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest. Most travelers make the relatively short 150 kilometer drive here straight from the capital, eager to see the gushing waterfalls that cascade down through the rocky undergrowth of the forests in steps and plunge pools. Another attraction are the ruins of a onetime iron foundry, where the forces of the hard-fought Paraguayan War once created weaponry and munitions while hidden in the hills. "
Yaguaron,"This small backwater town set in the shadow of the bulbous cliffs and rocky hills just south of the capital at Asuncion began life as a Spanish mission intended as a settlement spot for the Guarani natives back in the early decades of the 1600s. Today, and the striking church that was raised by the Europeans here to make their mark still stands on the grassy fields where it did all those centuries ago. It’s one of the prime examples of the Franciscan tradition in the country, and is a fine cultural addition to an exploration through the exhibition rooms of the nearby Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia Museum &#8211; the onetime home of the Paraguayan dictator, located just a stone’s throw away down the road. "
Playa de Areguá,"Just a short drive from the heart of the buzzing downtown streets of Asuncion, and now almost contiguous with the capital thanks to the ceaseless expansion of its outer suburbs, little, lakeside Aregua is a fine place to go to escape the heat and energy of Paraguay’s only real metropolis. Travelers can expect a pretty maze of cobbled streets and alleyways where the lingering facades of colonial Spain still stand tall. This all abuts the waters of Ypacarai Lake, sail boats and ferries heading to San Bernardino forever bobbing on its sky-blue waters. Then there are the fascinating hexagonal geological formations of the Koi and Chorori hills, looming just on the edge of the city. "
Itaugua,"Famed for its distinctive tribal art and traditional Paraguayan folk music scene, the small city of Itaugua is a great place to while away a few days as you make your way through the very heart of South America. Its inner streets come lined with swaying, shady eucalyptus trees and there are countless workshops where it’s possible to buy nanduti – a beautiful and intricate form of Paraguayan embroidery that originated in this region long ago. Meanwhile, the looming hill of Cerrito offers viewpoints on the edge of town and a smattering of colonial houses offer a glimpse at Itaugua’s deeper, Spanish-influenced past. "
Filadelfia,"Filadelfia sits just on the edge of the Gran Chaco, where the forests and undulating hills of the Region Oriental give way to the great boreal plains that form the very heartlands of the continent as a whole. That makes this far-flung town – the so-called ‘Capital of the Chaco – a very different place to the small southern cities of Aregua and Itaugua. But the curiosities don’t stop there either. Filadelfia is also German speaking, and plays host to the people of the Fernheim Colony, a transplanted Mennonite community that fled here from Stalinist Russia in the 1930s. Add to that a dairy farm and an earthy agricultural vibe, and you’ve got yourself a truly interesting spot smack bang in the middle of the nation! "
San Estanislao,"Named after a Polish saint, founded by Spanish Jesuits, intended to convert the native Guarani Indian peoples of San Pedro in central Paraguay, and infused with the cultures of immigrants from Italy, Germany and Eastern Europe throughout the last two centuries, the pint-sized yet interesting little stop-off of San Estanislao is like the history of the country writ small. In the 1800s it boomed with tobacco production, while today soy and pulses are the main crop raised in the surrounding fields. Travelers can come and see pretty tree-lined plazas and wallow in the bucolic feel of the place, all whilst meeting a lively crowd of students, beers in tow, during the later hours. "
"Concepcion, Paraguay","Located just on the cusp of the Grand Chaco and benefitting from great river connections to the larger cities of the south, Concepcion enjoyed an economic golden age before being plunged into conflict during the Paraguayan War. Today, its central streets and cobbled alleys still bear all the hallmarks of a colonial outpost that did very well indeed from its various agricultural pursuits. Visitors embark and disembark from their hop-on, hop-off river cruises up the meanders of the Paraguay River, wonder at the elegant facades and painted Spanish-style churches, and enjoy the sultry tropical airs as they go. "
La Santisima Trinidad de Parana,"Paraguay’s historical piece de resistance can be found set just north of the fun-loving southern hub of Encarnacion, rising from the rolling hills just a stone’s throw from the Parana River. A UNESCO World Heritage Site (the most-visited in the country no less), the spot is a fine example of a South American Jesuit Reduction. These would once have peppered the Latin lands from Argentina to Bolivia, and worked to convert the local Indian populations to Christianity in a non-invasive (at least as non-invasive as possible) way. Nowadays, the site showcases crumbling churches and priests’ living quarters, many adorned with European art works, others complete with a curious intermingling of Indian and Italianesque styles. This one’s simply not to be missed! "
San Cosme y Damian,"Jutting its way out into the colossal oxbow lakes and flooded plains that swell where the Parana River weaves along the borderline with Argentina to the south, the village of San Cosme y Damian is a real sight to behold. It comes encompassed by shimmering, palm tree-spotted, yellow-sanded dunes, which ebb and flow across the landscape before plunging down directly into the waters. There is also an interesting old Jesuit mission situated nearby, while boat trips and hiking excursions across the shores are a great way to explore the otherworldly vistas and shifting sands. "
"San Bernardino, Paraguay","Barred off from the chaos of the capital by the great liquid curve of Lake Ypacarai, San Bernardino has firmly established itself as one of the prime gateways for the moneyed jet setter Asuncenos. Ferries buzz across several times a day from the outer districts of Aregua, depositing folk on the waterside boulevards of Bernardino, between swaying palm trees and the artificial sand stretches that have been set up there. Of course, the town has oodles of pubs and discos to let loose in, and partiers flock to the plazas with beers and salsa-ready hips right throughout the summer high season (typically running from December to March). "
"Villarrica, Paraguay","Set in the shadow of the rugged Ybyturuzu highland ridges, Villarrica is a proud and historically rich Paraguayan town; a place where monuments to national heroes pepper the plazas, and some of the country’s most important cultural institutions and traditions are on the line-up. Take the Maestro Fermin Lopez Museum in the heart of town, which showcases collections of old munitions and arms from the Chaco War next to ancient Indian weaponry. Then there are the booming Easter celebrations, which erupt on the squares and between the gorgeous Spanish-style towers of the Franciscan church &#8211; one seriously handsome relic of the colonial era to say the least! "
"Soldiers And Sailors Memorial Hall And Museum, Pittsburgh",The Soldier and Sailor’s Memorial Hall is one of the best-known attractions in Pittsburgh. The museum tells the story of the servicemen that have served the United States since the civil war. The building has stood in memory of the country’s veterans since 1910. 
"Cathedral Of Learning, University Of Pittsburgh","At the centre of the University of Pittsburgh’s main campus, the Cathedral of Learning is a well-known attraction and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The cathedral is an imposing building, standing an impressive 163m over the campus. It has been described as a gothic skyscraper. Construction on the 34-story building was completed in 1931. "
"Pittsburgh Skyline, Pennsylvania","Pittsburgh is known for great food, adventure and a fascinating history. In 2015 Pittsburgh was named as a “Top Place to Go in 2015” by Conde Nast Traveller. The city is the second largest in Pennsylvania and has a population of 306,000 people. In 2016, the city of Pittsburgh will celebrate its bicentennial. "
"Delaware River, Penssylvania","The Delaware River passes through New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland in addition to Pennsylvania. In Northampton County, the river meanders past 17 miles of stunning farmland, historic sights and small towns. The welcome centre in Riverton provides a great introduction to the area as well as walking routes. "
Rural Pennsylvania,"The countryside in Pennsylvania is known for its great food, extensive history and countless outdoor activities. The countryside is stunning in all seasons and has plenty to offer in winter, such as snowboarding and skiing, or in summer, such as white water rafting and hiking. In autumn, the colours are particularly beautiful. "
"Codorus State Park, Pennsylvania","Codorus State Park, Pennsylvania "
Philadelphia,"Philadelphia certainly has plenty to offer and a trip to the City of Brotherly Love is always a pleasure. Known for its music, art and food, the city has not been affected by crushingly high real estate prices and still makes for an affordable but exhilarating place to live. "
"Duquense Incline Vertical, Pittsburgh","The century old Duquesne Incline cable cars allow for great views of Downtown Pittsburgh. The cable cars were first opened in 1877 and, after many year of use, were subsequently restored by local residents in 1963. Those taking a trip to the incline can see the inner workings of the machinery and visit the museum at the upper station, which explores Pittsburgh’s history. "
"Waterfall on Oakland Run, in York County, Pennsylvania",The waterfalls of York County come in various shapes and sizes but are all stunning and well worth a visit. Hiking is very popular in all seasons and there are a number of well-marked routes to follow that include views different waterfalls however there are also rewarding views for those willing to walk off the beaten track. 
Washington County Courthouse (Pennsylvania),"Another building in Pennsylvania with a remarkable history is the Washington County Court House. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, having been admitted in 1974. The building, which was first opened in 1900, is still in operation today. "
"Adam&#8217;s Fall, Glen State Park","The Glen State Park Fall Trails includes over 20 waterfalls and attracts thousands of visitors each year, all of whom come to marvel at its natural beauty. Sullivan falls is more difficult to reach than many of the others in the area but this means it is more peaceful and worth the adventure through the surrounding woodlands. "
"Salt Springs State Park, Pennsylvania","Salt Springs State Park in North-eastern Pennsylvania covers a massive 405 acres and is best known for its giant hemlock trees, estimated to be about 300 years old.  The park is also home to three waterfalls and a rocky gauge and is maintained by a group of volunteers known as the Friends of Salt Springs Park. "
Machu Picchu,"The great fortress in the clouds, the masterpiece of the Incas, the Andean citadel to rival all others, Machu Picchu rarely fails to draw a gasp. It sits perched a whopping 2,400 meters up on the spikey ridges above the winding Urubamba River; the jewel of the iconic Sacred Valley and reachable only by foot. Various treks weave their way up to the UNESCO heritage wonder from below, passing rustic Peruvian mountain towns and offering up breathtaking vistas of the Andes as they go. Then the prize itself emerges: a glorious conglomeration of terraced houses and temples, crumbling altarpieces and animist sculpture, draped dramatically between the cloud forests and oozing pre-Columbian history from every one of its cracked and weathered pores. Not even the conquistadores made it here! "
Lima,"Butting up to the Pacific rollers in lines of condominiums and lurching high-rises, Lima sprawls out over the Peruvian coastal plain in a patchwork of the new and the old. It’s a place where the elegant remnants of a colonial past rub shoulders with ancient ruins; where 500-year-old relics pepper the museum rooms close to bustling food courts bursting with South American ceviche and Pisco sours to knock your socks off. Of course, there’s a throbbing nightlife scene worthy of its 10 million people; erupting between the streets of Miraflores and Barranco every night of the week. And that’s not even mentioning the beaches that line the coast to the north and south of the city, awash with surfers at Cabo Blanco, sunbathers at Vichayito and cocktail sippers at Los Pocitas. Nice. "
Chan Chan,"The ancient gateway to the arid desert lands of the Moche Valley is now one of the most fascinating pre-Columbian dig sites in all of Peru (and that’s saying something!). It’s thought that the sprawling ruins of the city that can now be seen here, popping up like a cardboard cut-out almost organically from the beige dunes and ridges of the desert, were raised in the middle of the 9th century AD. Chan Chan was once the epicentre of the powerful Chimor Empire until the conquistadores established nearby power bases in Trujillo in the 1500s, and today the remains of monolith defence walls, countless temples and court rooms, and elaborate irrigation systems can all be seen. "
Huacachina,"Just a short dune ride (preferably by 4X4) from the city of Ica, little Huacachina rises like a tropical gem from amidst the shifting sands. An oasis town par excellence, this tiny settlement hugs its own small pop-up lake and comes dotted with lanky date palms which sway and wobble in the dry, dry breezes. Given its fantastic location on the rolling ochre-beige ridges of the Ica wilds, the town has become a regular favourite on the Peruvian travel trail, and now boasts a clutch of top-quality backpacker guesthouses, boutique hotels and even a surprising nightlife scene that’s fuelled by Pisco sours. By day, be sure to try your hand at sandboarding! "
Huaraz,"Everyone from intrepid mountaineers to casual hikers to view seekers flock to the high-perched town of Huaraz, which comes shrouded on all sides by the chiselled and precipitous peaks of the great Cordillera Blanca (many of which rise to a whopping 6,000 meters above sea level!). Earthquakes have long been the nemesis in this metamorphic corner of Peru, which means the town here has been built and rebuilt countless times. Still, it’s not really about the urban side of things. Not with the mint-white massifs of the Huascaran National Park beckoning to the east, complete with curious blooms of titanka plants, prehistoric cave art, dinosaur footprints and the craggy tops of Tawllirahu alike. "
Trujillo,"Trujillo is the largest city in Peru’s Moche Valley. Once trodden by the Spanish conquistadores, it still oozes a colonial charm from each of its marble plazas and technicolour churches. The clip clop of paso horses and the mellifluous sounds of Spanish chatter twist and turn around the palm-spattered Plaza de Armas at the metro’s heart, while Rococo elegance abounds on the Cathedral’s faces and the desert peaks of Moche rise to a bulwark on the horizon. It’s a truly beautiful place to while away some time in the north, and offers unrivalled access to the bucket-list attractions of Chan Chan and the Huaca del Sol just to the south. "
Tingo Maria,"Tingo Maria sits nestled deep in the Andean ridges, blooming in a thousand shades of green thanks to the wet and fertile climate of the Amazonia side of the mountains. Once considered virtually inaccessible, the spot soon became one of Peru’s prime commercial coffee growing centers, and the streets still enjoy the aromas of freshly-brewed beans and the energy of weekly farmer’s markets to boot. However, Tingo Maria is perhaps better known – at least to the gringo tourists who now flock here out of Lima – as the gateway to the jungle. The Tingo Maria National Park beckons just on the peripheries, home to the tunnels of the Owl Cave and the soaring summit of Pumarinri alike. "
Puno,"Laid-back and relaxed as it runs along the shores of Lake Titicaca, Puno is a real treat. With its cascading barrios of breeze-block buildings and dust-caked streets, it may not look the part. But Puno’s draws are on the water, not on the land. Boat trips are hugely popular, taking travelers out to see the likes of Amantani, with its earthy Quechua farmers and crumbling pre-Columbian temples, or Uros, and its iconic reed villages. Trips across to Bolivia and the Isla del Sol are also possible (this is the world’s highest navigable body of water after all!), while Puno itself offers up a great range of budget guesthouses and hotels to choose from. "
Tarapoto,"Fringed by swathes of montane jungle and blooming with its own resident population of palm trees, the so-called ‘City of Palms’ is a great place to sample real, raw Peruvian life right on the edge of the Andes. Eateries tout platters of local highland foods, spice-doused chicken and rice dishes, and refreshing sugarcane juices all along the central streets, while night time parties erupt in Morales and travel groups depart to swim in the roaring waterfalls at Ahuashiyacu and Huacamaillo. Outdoors adventures are never too far away, with the tropical reaches of the Amazon and its many rivers and jungle-clad valleys beckoning just to the east. "
Tarma,"Cascading its way down the mountain ridges of the Southern Sierra in a dash of pretty Spanish-style bungalows with terracotta roofs, Tarma is one of the lesser known stop-offs in the Junin Region. Despite lurking just a little from the tracks of the Inca Trail, the town only draws a humble crowd of visitors each year. Those who do come can enjoy chacta-packed teas in the cafes, wonder at the colours during the Festival of Flowers in September and unravel more than 500 years of history to boot (Tarma was one of the first hill stations in this section of the Andes to be established by the conquistadores). Hiking is also popular, with treks around the foothills and mountain lakes here weaving in and out of the Andes and the Amazon alike. "
Puerto Maldonado,"Straddling the waterways of the Tambopata and Madre de Dios Rivers as they join to form one of the tributaries to the mighty Amazon in the east, Puerto Maldonado is Peru’s jungle city par excellence. Once only accessible by boat, the town has recently joined the country’s ever-expanding road network and now booms with hikers and wildlife seekers during its high-season. They come to spy out the multi-coloured macaws and old -rowth rainforests that the enticing trio of the Tambopata National Reserve, the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park offer to the north-west and south-east alike. If you do head to those wilds, expect everything from cultural encounters with Peruvian tribes to giant otters and spectacled bears! "
"Arequipa, Peru","Peru’s onetime capital and second most populous metropolis, 850,000-strong Arequipa is the buzzing metro hub of the country’s southern reaches. It can be found spread out over the highlands of the Huayco Uchumayo, set in the shadow of three mighty volcanos: brooding Misti, the snow-mantled massifs of Pikchu Pikchu, soaring, 6,000-meter-high Chachani. The town bears one glorious UNESCO core of old-style mansions and Spanish colonial churches, all fused with the traditions of Peruvian building to create the unique architectural look now hailed as Escuela Arequipena. To see this first hand, check out the 16th-century Santa Catalina Monastery, the neoclassical Basilica Cathedral, or the almost Petra-esque Church of the Jesuits. "
Urubamba,"Situated between the green slopes and cloud forests of the much-visited Sacred Valley of the Incas, Urubamba is the gateway to some of Peru’s most bucket-list sights. In the town, the streets are thronged with everything from classy hotels to earthy guesthouses, gringos and walkers fresh from the Incan Trail flitting between the bars and Plaza de Armas on rumbling auto rickshaws. It’s one of the top bases for exploring the various ancient sites that adorn the ridges here, whether that means scaling to the heights of Machu Picchu, hitting the agricultural terraces of Tipon, seeking the mysterious ruins of Choquequirao, or enjoying ecotourism in the cultural attraction of Chichubamba. "
Cusco,"The onetime epicentre of Incan power in the Americas is now a thriving tourist hub, touting everything from glorious Spanish churches to the crumbling remnants of the city’s former pre-Columbian masters. With century upon century of Peruvian past concealed beneath the town’s throbbing streets, it’s easy to see why so many travelers make their way here. Just check out the whitewashed cottages of Barrio de San Blas, awash with Incan treasures below their floors, or the glowing Plaza de Armas, where Andalusian arcades rise and fall beneath the baroque majesty of the Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin. And when it’s time to leave the city, Peru’s most iconic backcountry awaits: the cloud forests and Incan treasures of the Sacred Valley! "
Nazca Lines,"Nazca is best known as the jumping off point for seeing the famous Nazca Lines: centuries-old petroglyphs and markings carved out of the rolling pampas on the edge of the Chilean Atacama. The air is dry and dusty in the town, and most of the city is pleasant and walkable. Tour operators here will clamber over one another to offer travelers flights out over the mysterious UNESCO site in the desert, while trips to Cahuachi and Paredones, and the prehistoric cave systems and walking trails of the Palpa Valley, are also fine options for any looking to combine adventure and history in one. "
Wroclaw,"Pronounced VRAHTS-wahv, Wroclaw is the fourth-largest city in Poland.  Built in the medieval period, the city covers several islands and maintains several beautiful bridges and stunning architecture. Wroclaw has been busy racking up recognition lately.  In 2015 it was named one of the “Best Cities To Live” by Mercer consulting company; and due to their high living standard it’s classified as a global city by GaWC.  In 2016 the city will become the European Capital of Culture as well as the World Book Capital. Those who know Wroclaw best will tell you not to miss Salt Market Square, Centennial Hall (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), or St Mary Magdalene Church (13th century). "
Warsaw,"This sprawling city is Poland’s capital. It’s long and turbulent history can be seen in the distinct forms of architecture.  You’ll find Gothic churches, Soviet-era blocks, modern skyscrapers, and neoclassical palaces. Warsaw has a thriving music scene and a vibrant nightlife. Though the city was largely destroyed during WWII, Old Town has been restored to mirror its pre-war glory, complete with cobbled alleys, charming cafes, and a unique sense of the past. Also not to be missed are the old royal residences which have long been associated with the ruling class and important events in history. Round out your visit by stopping at the Museum of the History of Polish Jews to see exhibits on their 1000 year history. "
Gdansk,"Gdansk is one of the three cities in the Pomerania area that are popularly known as Tri-City (Polish: Trójmiasto). This city on the Baltic coast has a unique vibe that separates it from the rest of the country. It’s a place that’s been shaped by the wide variety of wealthy merchants attracted by its port. In the heart of Gdansk lies the reconstructed Main Town with colourful facades, shops, and restaurants. The crowning glory is the Neptune Fountain, built in the 17th century; it serves as a symbol of the city. When you’re done with St. Mary’s Church or Oliwa Archcathedral, enjoy a pleasure boat cruise upriver and a brew at a beer garden along the dock. "
Gdynia,"Polish people have voted Gdynia to be a “freedom city.” Since the first free elections, held in 1989, the city has transformed itself by building up living standards and concentrating on growth and progress. One of the three Tri-Cities, Gdynia is another great port town perfect for water lovers and maritime enthusiasts. Visit the Dar Pomorza, a full rig sailing ship built in 1909.  There’s also the National Marine Fisheries Research Institute and the Gdynia Aquarium. Each summer, the city hosts the Open’er Music Festival which attracts amazing headlining artists from across the globe. "
Sopot,"The final Tri-City destination, Sopot is a small seaside resort town.  Directly between Gdansk and Gdynia, it’s been a get-away for the royals and elite for centuries – even through the Communist era. Sopot has sparkling beaches and glitzy resorts all along the coast, giving it an exclusive air.  You’ll often find the beach packed with sunbathers and volleyball lovers. Locals will tell you about the Wooden Pier (the longest in Europe), exciting Monte Casino Street, and Forest Opera set in a beautiful wooded area. Tourists will tell you not to miss Krzywy Domek, also known as the Crooked House because of its unusual Gaudi-like shape. "
Cracow,"Once the capital of Poland, Cracow is now considered the cultural capital of the country. Best known for its medieval core and Jewish quarter, the city is centred on Rynek Glówny (market square), built in 1257 and now one of the largest markets in Europe. The well-planned streets and tree-line pedestrian avenues make it enjoyable to stroll through the city. Stop and visit Jagellonian University or Wawel Castle – home of the Polish kings for almost 600 years. Don’t forget Old Town (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), 14th century St. Mary’s Basilica, and Cloth Hall, a wonderful Renaissance-era outpost. "
Szczecin,"This small coastal town is definitely off the beaten track (at least for non-Germans).  Szczecin is a mix of several cultural and architectural influences from several different ages. Reconstruction has been long and difficult here which means that you’ll find German-era Art Nouveau buildings alongside modern steel and class buildings – both of which are alongside crumbled and overlooked ruins from the war. You’ll want to stop at Bismarck Tower and the National Museum located primarily in the Landed Gentry House. And finally there’s the Ducal Castle, home of the dukes of Pomerania-Stettin for roughly 500 years. "
Poznan,"This town, located in west-central Poland, is best known for its renaissance old town, which, like most of Poland, was complete destroyed during WWII, has been beautifully rebuilt, and now thrives.  A ramble through Poznan&#8217;s market square will fill you with the energy and bustle of the town.  Morning or night, this place is always buzzing thanks to the pubs, clubs, and restaurants that can be found here. You must visit Ostrów Tumski cathedral, The New Zoo, and enjoy water sports at Lake Malta. Porta Posnania Interactive Heritage Centre shares the birth of Poland through technological and interactive displays, and the Monument to the Victims of June 1956 can be found on Plac Mickiewicza. "
Torun,"Torun is well known as the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543). It’s also well-known for its fantastic gingerbread. The city has combined these two well-known’s into one:  you can buy gingerbread made in Copernicus’s image.  Located in Northern Poland on the Vistual River, Torun is one of the oldest cities in the country. This is the place to come to take a break from the main tourist circuit.  Largely untouched by WWII, there is quite a bit to see here.  Visit the Bronze Donkey statue to learn its sinister history, the House of Copernicus, Pied Piper Fountain, and several UNESCO World Heritage sites amidst the city’s medieval defences. "
Malbork,"Malbork has one thing that attracts most of its visitors, but that one thing is pretty incredible.  Malbork Castle stands at the top of the list for all people travelling to Poland. Stunning both inside and out, this UNESCO World Heritage Site completed in 1409 is Europe’s largest Gothic castle. Also not to be missed is Skwer Esperanto, located just past the ruins of the old city walls.  Within this park are commemorative stones placed by well-known international speakers, all of them honouring Ludwig Zamenhof and the world language he created. "
Rzeszów,"Located on both sides of the Wislok River, in the heart of the Sandomierska Valley, lies Rzeszów; one of Poland’s most important cities. Rzeszów appears to be a quiet small town by the river, but it’s actually a progressive centre of economics and culture. There quite a few things you don’t want to miss here, including Market Square, Town Hall, the 1890 public library, the “small” and “big” synagogues, the Old Cemetery and Jewish Cemetery, the Wanda Siemaszkowa Theatre, and the “Revolution Acts” Monument. Perhaps the towns crowning jewel is the Lubomirski Palace, which dates back to the 18th century. "
Lódz,"Lódz (pronounced Woodge) is located in the centre of the country and has a challenging history.  Known for its high-quality textiles, the city fell to ruins during the 20th century and has struggled to regain its sense of self. Recently, a major re-building was begun; considered by many to be one of Europe’s biggest renovation efforts.  Newly re-finished is the main pedestrian walkway, ul Piotrkowska. Still in the middle of their rebirth, Lódz is a fascinating city to visit for just this reason. In addition to textile, Lódz is the home of the Polish film industry and is nicknamed “Holly-woodge.” Enjoy Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (1884), the Cinematography Museum, Museum of Ethnography and Archaeology, the Jewish Cemetery, and the Annihilation Monument of the Litzmannstadt Ghetto – a chilling reminder of the effects of the Holocaust on the cities Jewish population. "
Zakopane,"Zakopane is a resort town popular with domestic and international tourists – perhaps the best known in Poland.  Situated at the base of the Tatras mountain range, you’ll find hiking and mountain climbing in the summer and skiing, snowboarding, and more during the winter.  Centrally located, it serves as a good home base for nearby Gubalówka and Kasprowy Wierch – two ski destinations accessible by funicular. Everywhere you look you’ll find breathtaking mountain views. Travel to Morskie Oko, an emerald-green mountain lake just outside of town.

No matter your beliefs, Fátima is an impressive site to see; it’s an interesting look into some of the religious culture of Portugal. "
Faro,"The entire Algarve region is famous in Portugal, and the Algarve’s most famous destination is Faro. This capital city feels more Portuguese than most resort towns which is too bad because most people just pass through. There’s a lot to discover here, including a delightful marine, plazas and parks, the historic old down with outdoor cafes and wonderful pedestrian lanes, the archaeological museum and a Renaissance cathedral known as Bishops Palace. There’s a student population that keeps the nightlife interesting as well.  The medieval quarters are fabulously maintained and hidden within you’ll find unique little museums, churches, and even a bone chapel. The Parque Natural da Ria Formasa lagoons are also nearby and make a great spot for exploration. "
San Juan,"Tucked inside a tiny islet that protects the harbour, San Juan is an old town, settled by colonists roughly 100 years before the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts.

Rio Camuy Caves,"About one hour’s drive from the capital of San Juan is where the planets third largest river carves out roughly 220 caves over the course of ten miles. You can visit with one of the many organized tour groups or find an adventure operator who will show you what spelunking was meant to be. Geologists hypothesize that there could be as many as 800 undiscovered caves there. Run by the Parques Nacionales, the caves are located in a 300-acre park and park guides offer walking tours of the area. This is nature at her best and most stunning. And if you’re wondering what that heat is, it’s the heat that’s given off by the hundreds of sleeping bats that nest at the top of the caves. "
"Playa Brava, Culebra","Just seven miles from the mainland, the two spectacular gems of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean are Vieques and Culebra. After 50 years of military occupation (now over), you’ll be surprised by the completely laid-back atmosphere and the towns populated by expats, locals, and sailors on leave. There’s a ton of delights waiting to be discovered on the islands: endangered turtles and herds of beautiful wild horses. Most people go for the incredible beaches. Several are deserted, which allows you to stretch out and sink in and many say that Vieques and Culebra have the best beaches in all of the Caribbean. All in all, the islands haven’t been over developed yet which allows them to keep their quaint vibe. "
Mosquito Bay Vieques,"If you’re going to be spending time on the island of Vieques, most travellers will tell you that Mosquito Bay needs to be your home base. If the calming view of Sun Bay isn’t enough, the seclusion that you feel is often one of the major draws here. The beach is about two miles long, one of the few with public facilities and life guards on the island, and people love the feeling of getting away from it all. For that very reason, the beach is most popular in the evening time, around sunset. "
El Yunque National Rainforest,"The only tropical forest in the entire United States National Forest Organization, El Yunque is a huge favourite among those who love hiking and being in nature. Just 35 miles east of San Juan, the park receives over 100 billion gallons of precipitation each year. Remember to wear waterproof clothes and bring waterproof gear as well. There are 13 trails that range from easy to difficult. Be sure to check out Big Tree Trail and La Mina – both of which follow La Mina River and wind up near La Mina Falls. Another necessity is to plan for at least two days. Camping is a great option but there are plenty of accommodations in the area as well. "
La Vuelta Cycling Tour,"If you’re looking for a way to see the entire country at the perfect pace, consider participating in the La Vuelta Cycling Tour. You’ll see all 375 coastal miles of the country from the seat of your bike. Don’t be intimidated by the name, it’s more of a tour than a race, and people from all over enjoy the spirit and the community of it all. For three days each January, riders cycle through tropical rainforests, marinas, coconut plantations, cover some fantastic beaches, and go through over 42 towns. You probably do need to be relatively fit to enjoy La Vuelta, but the organizers set up rest stops along the route and many riders break and relax for a while during the day in order to take in their surroundings. At night, there’s incredible food and Puerto Rican hospitality to enjoy. "
Ponce,"Many consider Puerto Rico’s second largest city to be reflect the essence of the country. The often repeated saying, Ponce es Ponce (Ponce is Ponce) reflects its reputation for being a bit unique. When you walk through town and see the lovely fountains in the square, or stroll down the narrow lanes of the historic centre, you’ll get a sense of the wonderful history of the place. You’ll find all the urban problems of a modern city – like traffic congestion and crowding, but you’ll also find over a dozen museums, wonderful colonial architecture, and a fabulous boardwalk filled with restaurants worth visiting two or three times each. "
Castillo San Cristóbal,"Built to protect old San Juan from attacks, Fort San Cristóbal isn’t on many of the travel guides (like the more popular Fort El Morro), but it’s worth your time to get a sense of the history of Puerto Rico. The views of the shore from the fort are worth the trip alone. Spend an hour or two wandering through the sprawling complex, visiting the dungeons and picturing life gone by as you stand in the courtyard and take it all in. "
Condado,"If you’ve come to Puerto Rico for the beach, it’s entirely possible that you’ll never get any farther than Condado. Located in the middle of some unbelievable high rise towers and resort, Condado is the place for beach bars and any water sport you can think of. This is a beach in the heart of the city so it’s lively and something is always happening there. Waiters will cater to your every cocktail whim and its close proximity to so many hotels makes it easy to spend a day in the sun and then head out into the city at night. "
Carolina Beach,"Also in San Juan, Carolina is a public beach that’s popular with both tourists and locals. Families love it because the tides aren’t too strong and there’s a life guard on duty during the day. It’s popular, which translates to often crowded, but for many, that kind of energy is what makes a beach great. Great water sport rentals here too so plan to bring a cooler of your favourite beverages and spend a day relaxing. "
Guanica State Forest,"Calling all nature lovers! Guanica was designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1981 and this dry forest is one of the best in all of the Caribbean. Guanica is also well-loved by birds. More than 50 percent of Puerto Rico’s bird species make their home here. There are over 36 miles of trails to hike and discover the more than 700 plant species in the forest – 48 of which are, unfortunately, endangered. The forest covers about 1000 acres and gets about 30 inches of rain each year (compared to El Yunques&#8217; 200+ inches!) – enough to keep it green and beautiful. Bring your binoculars and enjoy. "
Fort El Morro,"Jutting out from San Juan harbour is El Morro, strategically placed there in the 16th century to defend the city against sea attacks. This six story fort is massive and is considered the number one place to explore when travelling in the city. The views are inspiring and the history is intriguing. If you’re feeling adventurous, go underground and explore the prison cells and extensive tunnels. It’s recommended that you plan half a day for El Morro as there is plenty of ground to cover here. "
Desecheo Island,"Designated as one of Puerto Rico’s “Galapagos of the Caribbean,” Desecheo’s history is a little bizarre and definitely unique. The interior is off limits due to the possibility of unexploded ordinance left over from military training in the 1940’s. There’s also a ton of Rhesus monkeys on the island. They were brought there in the 1960’s as part of a science experiment. Out by the shore, underwater, lie the real reasons you visit Desecheo. There’s an extensive network of undersea caves and canyons that make this the perfect destination for scuba diving. Just 12 miles from the mainland, the island is uninhabited and you’ll love relaxing on its beautiful beaches between dives. "
Mona Island,"Mona Island is 22 square miles of uninhabited ecological reserve. If you’re looking for unspoiled and pristine Puerto Rico, this is the place. The island has park rangers that oversee the camping facilities and you can stay there from May to November. Explore the island and discover ancient carvings created by the Taino Indians who once made the island home. Another of the “Galapagos of the Caribbean” islands, this place exudes mystery and rugged beauty. If you want off the grid you won’t do better than Mona Island. "
Hell Mile,"In Cerro de Nandy in San Lorenzo, you can take part in a killer extreme race known affectionately as Hell Mile. Attracting extreme athletes and wide assortment of interesting characters, the course is a one-mile run up and down a rather intense mountain. But it’s not just up and down once. During round two you make the same trek with a 15-25 pound bag. And then in round three the bag gets heavier. And if that isn’t enough, they hold the race in July, one of the hottest months everywhere. This well-known race is a point of pride not just for the survivors (er, participants), but also for the locals. If you’re not feeling up to three rounds of Hell Mile, consider stopping by and watching the extreme fun. Sure to make for some great stories back home. "

Like the Great Barrier Reef, most of the Daintree Forest is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site (Wet Tropics of Queensland), listed under the , and for good reason: it’s fascinating for nature-lovers and scientists alike, as it presents a uniquely detailed record of the processes by which Australian flora and fauna have evolved, with living relics of the Gondwanan era in the form of the closest surviving relatives to many ancient marsupials; also, its flora is considered to be the nearest example to what a Gondwanan forest would have been like. Tours are available to give you some fascinating insights into the science and history of the Daintree Rainforest, but you can also enjoy relaxing walks and soak up the gorgeous scenery: waterfalls, wild rivers, and forest and coastal vistas. It’s a wonderful example of the beauty of the Australian landscape. "

You can swim and search for seashells along South Shore Beach, splash in waves’ whitewash at Goosewing Beach Preserve, and talk a stroll through the tranquil Sakonnet Garden.

Near the Foster section of the trail is also the top of Jerimoth Hill, the highest point in the state. "
Burrs Hill Park,"If you’re a traveler in love with the arts, you’ll enjoy spending time in Warren. Warren is a small town with a big creative community. There are many art studios, live theater performances, live music venues, and handmade jewelry shops throughout town. Maybe their inspiration comes from the setting? Even the George Hail Library looks more like a castle than a public building. Outside, you’ll love spending time at Town Beach, Burrs Hill Park on the waterfront, and wandering through the Town Wharf. You can cycle along the shoreline and watch the boats sail in and out when it’s time to rest. "
Watch Hill Lighthouse Station,"Watch Hill is a luxury travel destination that is popular among affluent New Englanders and Americans hailing from all over the country.

The Frosty Drew Nature Center and Observatory and the National Wildlife Refuge are also great places to visit. The town center has over ten buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of the well-preserved colonial style architecture. The main funky attraction is the Fantastic Umbrella Factory that sells all types of plants, trees, and flowers with animals like goats, emus, and chickens roaming around the premises. It’s a menagerie of natural oddities with a fun souvenir and café to spend time at. "
Purple Cat Winery,"This small town has a lot of personality despite its small size. Many travelers come by just for the Purple Cat Winery. Not a typical winery – the grapes aren’t grown on site – the Purple Cat Winery is a funky place where you can enjoy wine without any of the wine snobbery or pressure to purchase. Purple lightbulbs create an interesting ambience, and there are purple cats in various forms all throughout the venue. You can even take yoga classes upstairs, shop at the onsite boutique, or grab a healthy lunch before you go. Many visitors love staying at the White Rock Motel, a family owned 1950s style single story motel that has great customer service and cozy décor. Lakes, ponds, hiking trails and all types of outdoor sightseeing points surround the town as well. "
Tilted Barn Brewery,"Exeter has a few sites in Rhode Island that can’t be found anywhere else and is a hotspot for outdoor activities. It’s nearby Yawgoo Valley, a recreation dedicated to snow sports and is the only ski resort in the state. The Beach Pond is a great fishing site with many species of fish to cast a line for. In town, there’s a lot to admire as well. Lawton’s Mill is an 18th century house and wood-frame mill that many people come to photograph.

The museum offers insightful exhibitions that connect visitors to American history – all while fostering the community. "
Harrisville,"Love spooky sights? Visit Harrisville, the site where a horror movie, The Conjuring, was filmed. The really freaky thing is that the movie is based on a true story. In the 1970s, the Perron family moved into a Harrisville house with their five daughters. They were tormented by evil ghosts and spirits. A look into the past reveals that many people throughout history have been violently killed on the property. Though the house is private, you can view it from afar. Even when you walk through the town and away from the property, it’s common to feel a cold chill. "
Westerly Town Beach,"If you’re traveling through Rhode Island with public transportation, you’ll want to hop off the Amtrak train in Westerly. This small town is located on the beach and has tens of restaurants, shops, and outdoor activities to choose from. It’s also incredibly beautiful – with over ten buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Spend the day in the sun at Wilcox Park or Westerly Town Beach, a perfectly clean and undisturbed stretch of sand that anyone can access. "
Bucharest,"Romania’s capital and commercial centre has a great energy and the locals know how to have fun. Without doubt, Bucharest’s most iconic landmark is the communist-era Palatul Parlamentului government building.  With 1,100 rooms and its massive blue-print, it’s the second largest building on the planet. Enjoy everything from the nightlife in the Lipscani district to the 15th-century Curtea Veche palace where Vlad the Impaler once ruled. Must-sees include the Romanian Athenaeum and Cismigiu Garden. The city is a combination of modern capitalism and remnants of the communist era, but tucked away in surprising pockets are graceful villas, 17th century churches, lovely parks, and trendy cafes. "
Brasov,"Located in Transylvania and ringed by the Carpathian Mountains, Brasov is one of the most visited tourist locations in Romania. Home to the towering Black Church with its 4,000 pipe organ (13th century), it’s definitely worth your time.  It combines city life and old world charm with stunning landscapes and rich history.  You’ll want to see Piata Sfatului (Council Square) and the Casa Sfatului (local museum).  But the real reason to visit is Bran Castle &#8211; otherwise known as Dracula’s Castle. There’s a ton of myth to sort through, but Bran the setting of Bram Stokers Dracula and is now a museum open to tourists. You’ll love strolling through Brasov’s maze of streets, boho cafes, and real life gingerbread houses. "
Sibiu,"A couple hours north of Bucharest is Sibiu, situated on the Cibin River in Transylvania. Considered a cultural gem, the baroque squares and quaint cobblestone streets have a unique appeal. Voted the European Capital of Culture in 2007, Sibiu created the countries first library, pharmacy, and hospital. There’s a large handful of “must visit places,” but the top of the list includes the Brukenthal National Museum, the Gothic church with 6,002 pipes and a dizzying church tower you can climb, the tomb of Prince Mihnea the Bad, who was murdered in front of the church, and the ASTRA National Museum Complex. Sibiu has more festivals than any other city in Romania – not to mention plenty of theatre, opera, and exhibitions. "
Sighisoara,"Step back in time in Sighisoara, a 12th century Transylvania-Saxon town; perhaps the best preserved medieval town in all of Europe.  This UNESCO World Heritage site is a completely intact gem dating from the 16th century.  With nine towers, burgher houses, cobbled streets, and stunning churches, it’s drenched in ambiance and atmosphere. There’s more to discover about the Dracula legend here – it’s the birthplace of Vlad Dracula, a.k.a. Vlad the Impaler.  Vlad ruled during the 15th century and is Bram Stokers inspiration for the fictional Count Dracula. Visitors can stop by his home as well as the Church on the hill, the Dominican Monastery, and the Venetian House. "
Sulina,"If you’re looking for a sleepy fishing port to put your feet up for a bit, then Sulina, and its tranquil beach, is just the place. The town is Romania’s easternmost point and possibly the loveliest stopping point on any Danube journey. Most tourists use Sulina as their home base for deeper explorations into the delta and along the Black Sea.  Explore the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, visit Argamum and Enisala, medieval fortresses, and discover Saon and Celic Dere, two orthodox monasteries. No matter what, you’ll be amazed at the diversity of wildlife and the beauty of this tiny town. "
The Deva Citadel Ruins,"The standout attraction in Deva is Citadel Hill, a nature reserve being protected because of the rare floral species found there as well as the horned adder. Built in the 13th century, the ruins of the citadel remain on top of the hill – which you can climb or reach by cable car.  For those on their way to Corvin Castle, it’s a perfect overnight stay. You can enjoy the Arts Theatre, Patria Cinema, and the Old Centre.  Some trivia for you: Deva is the gymnastics capital of Romania (remember Nadia Comaneci?) "
Baile Herculane,"Archaeological digs confirm that humans have inhabited the area of modern day Baile Herculane since the Palaeolithic period. You can visit Pestera Hotilor (The Cave of Thieves) to see proof for yourself. The town is now famous for its luxurious thermal springs.  Legend holds that Hercules himself once stopped here to bathe and rest.  The city is so fond of its famous visitor that no less than six statues of him have been discovered here. Since WWII, people have come for the healing properties of the hot springs.  Baile Herculane is a funny mix of senior citizens enjoying their retirement and the university crowd, looking for a great holiday. "
Cluj-Napoca,"The unofficial capital of Transylvania, Cluj-Napoca is a vibrant university town. It boasts an energetic nightlight as well as historical landmarks dating back to Saxon rule. Everyone will tell you, this is a town that’s big on charm.  It serves as the film capital of Romania and each May the Transylvania International Film Festival is held here.  Visit Piata Unirii, a Gothic-style church, the baroque-era Bánffy Palace, now home to a Romanian art museum, and a dramatic statue of King Matthais Corvinus (15th century). Cluj often serves as a launching point for trips to the Apuseni Maramures mountain ranges. "
Suceava,"Suceava is considered the gateway into all things cultural, historical, and natural in the Bucovina region.  It’s also home to the Painted Monasteries. Once the capital of Moldavia, the city has some incredible landmarks, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Saint George’s Church, the Buconvina Ethnographic Museum, and the Princely Court. At first glance, this is a pretty unassuming town. However, it makes a perfect base camp for visiting the many fortresses in the area. Plus, it’s a great place to return to every night as the food here is phenomenal and the laid-back nightlife enjoyable. "
Timisoara,"Timi?oara is the main social and cultural centre in western Romania. It’s a popular destination among urbanites who love its diversity. Often called Primul Oras Liber (First Free Town), the first anti- Ceausescu protests broke out here and ultimately led to the demise of Ceausescu and his wife in 1989. City planning dates back to the 13th century and over the years the Romans, Turks, and Serbs, and Austrians have laid claim to the place.  With such a unique history, Timisoara’s public squares, gorgeous parks, neighbourhoods, and beautiful gardens have incredible cultural influences. The city’s second nickname is “Little Vienna,” because of the year-round music festivals, theatre, art exhibitions, and museums. "
Vama Veche,"Near the border of Bulgaria and sitting right on the coast of the Black Sea is Vama Veche.  This city knows what its word is, and that word is: Party! (Exclamation point required!). All summer long you’ll find enticing beach-front bars, restaurants, and clubs with non-stop 24/7 service. Thousands of people flock here at the end of the work week to let loose on the beach. Grand opening weekend is always May 1st weekend and the season closes with the Stuff Stock Music Festival at the end of August. Swim in the Black Sea, fall in love with the Boho free spirit attitude, and soak up as much sun as you want. "
Maramures,"Travel to Maramures, a mountain region in northern Romania in order to relax and take a long deep breath of fresh air.  The region is famous for its wooden churches, most of which are several hundred years old. The place to be in Maramures is Baie Mare, the capital. For over 2,000 years, people have been mining for silver, gold, and other metals in this traditional Romanian town. Much of its medieval past has been preserved in the main square, Piata Libertatii. Baie Mare is the best place to get a taste of traditional Romanian life. While there visit Piata Izvoarelor, the open air food market, and Butcher’s Tower. "
Hunedoara Castle,"Ask any Romanian and they’ll tell you that, hands down, the best castle in the country is Corvin Castle, found in Hunedoara.  Located in Transylvania in the Poiana Rusca Mountains, the city is a mix of Romanians, Hungarians, and Germans. Lush trees flank the streets making it an idyllic setting as you make your way to the castle. Also known as Hunyadi Castle, it’s one of the largest in Europe and for those that love visiting European castles, this one is always at the top of the lists. Don’t let the castle blind you, there is plenty to see and do in Hunedoara.  Cinci Lake is nearby, as are Nandru Cave, the Furnace of Govajdia, and St. Nicholas Church.  Many tourists also use the city as a staging point for trips into the Poiana Rusca Mountains. "
Peles Castle,"Sinaia is named for Mount Sinai and high above the town, you can see a cross on the mountain, placed there by a nobleman in 1965 who later went on to found Sinaia monastery there. This mountain resort has a number of things to attract the average tourist, not the least of which is Peles Castle; dating from 1883, it’s an extraordinary site and home of Romania’s first king. It’s filled with hidden passages to tease the imagination. Sinaia is situated in a small valley filled with marvellous fir-trees.  It’s a quaint town that fills with hikers each summer and skiers each winter.  Set against the breath-taking crags of the Bucegi Mountains, many tourists come just for the dramatic day hikes. "
Turda salt mine,"Ranked as one of the top 22 spectacular tourist destinations, Salina Turda is a salt mine in Durgau-Valea Sarata that’s been open to tourists since 1992.  Roughly two million tourists find their way there each year to see the eclectic coloured Hapsburg facades of the village. Visit the Turda Gorge and the eerie, yet still awesome, salt mine. Strangely, there are some 1000 varieties of plant and animal species in this small area, some of which are quiet rare or endangered. Just an hour outside of Cluj, it makes a great day excursion "
Kigali,"Since the dark days of the Rwandan genocide, the city of Kigali really has done a U-turn. Where once marauding gangs and death patrols roamed, today there are bustling markets and spice-scented street stalls. The ramshackle barrios now ooze the energy of day-to-day bustle, while the appearance of shimmering steel skyscrapers on the horizon is just another sign of the flow of foreign investment in these parts. There are a couple of things you simply need to see: the moving Genocide Memorial and the grand presidential palace. Apart from that, it&#8217;s just a case of taking in the newfound national confidence, shopping Rwandan handicrafts in the bazaars, and sinking cold ones in the raucous nightclubs. "
National University,"Huye was once known as Butare, and most locals still call it that today. But whatever its moniker may change to, there&#8217;s no altering this one&#8217;s prestigious history. Huye is the home of the National University and the National Institute of Scientific Research, along with countless other revered learning centers. That makes it something like Rwanda&#8217;s answer to English Oxford, or Massachusetts&#8217; Cambridge. It also makes it a place rich with cultural attractions. Visitors can hear tales of the old Tutsi monarchs at the National Museum of Rwanda; they can eat alongside erudite students, and they can delve into the stalls and handicraft emporiums of Huye Market. "
Volcanos National Park,"While most African hinterlands away from the Great Rift Valley are forced to compete with the likes of Kruger and Maasai Mara, Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, when it comes to the wild, mist-topped backcountry of Rwanda&#8217;s Volcanos National Park, all bets are off! Yep, this truly breathtaking conservation area – contiguous with Virunga across the border – is topped by the once-smoking calderas of mighty mounts like Karisimbi and serrated Sabyinyo. All around these craggy volcanic peaks, visitors discover lush montane forests and thick groves of African redwoods. And within those there&#8217;s another treasure: the uber-rare mountain gorilla! "
Kibuye,"Kibuye juts its way into the blue-brown waters of Lake Kivu in a series of curved headlands and steep-sided bays. Surely one of the most handsome towns in all of Rwanda, it&#8217;s surrounded by high hills that come dressed in wisps of mist by morning and offering sweeping views of the lake waters and the islands by afternoon. Between the streets, there are some earthy little eco lodges on the shores, along with one interesting Catholic church, and a memorial to the Rwandan genocide. There&#8217;s also a smattering of empty beaches around the center, and oodles of boats available for tours away from the banks. "
Akagera National Park,"Akagera National Park is the same savannah and riparian swamp mosaic you&#8217;d expect to find in the super-famous game parks of the East African Rift. That&#8217;s because its 1,200 square kilometers of land abut right up to the border with Tanzania, giving rise to roaming herds of giraffes, antelopes, jackals and more. Safaris are slowly becoming popular, with outfitters now organizing game drives and game walks from the smattering of lodges that exist. And the environments are beautiful too, with the meanders of the Kagera River giving way to shimmering Lake Shakani, oodles of papyrus swamps and protected birding areas aplenty. "
Gisenyi,"The gateway to that great speck of blue that is Lake Kivu, sitting amidst the verdant hills and mountains of the Albertine Rift Valley, Gisenyi is a place where the African jungles cascade down grassy hills in sporadic bouts of palm trees and exotic cassiyas. They fall to meet the muddied waters of the lake, where flitting insects and boatman flies cause ripples on the surface. Although shared with larger Goma across the border with DRC to the west, the banks of the lake are the real draw. They are peppered with bamboo built shacks and eco lodges – perfect for those eager to immerse themselves and escape in the Rwandan wilderness. "
"Royal Palace, Nyanza","There was once a time when Rwandan royalty trod the dusty lanes and roadways of far-flung Nyanza; when ancestral monarchs wandered under the great bulbous domes of the adobe and thatched ancient King&#8217;s Palace. One of the last capitals of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Rwanda, this spot in the southern reaches of the country is steeped in history and tradition. Come and trace the story of the nation&#8217;s onetime leaders, unravel sobering and moving episodes of the Rwandan Genocide, and tour the museum collections that lurk in the old court rooms. Nyanza is also the home of the Rwesero Art Museum; perhaps the most prestigious and rich in the country. "
Nyungwe Forest National Park,"There are few protected forests that can boast the same kind of superlatives as Rwanda&#8217;s mystical Nyungwe Forest National Park. For starters, this vast area of more than 940 square kilometers is the single largest enclave of montane forest remaining in this corner of the continent. What’s more, the thick canopies of mahoganies and clambering jungle vines hide one of the most diverse arrays of simian life in the world. There are chimpanzees and rare golden monkeys, grey-cheeked mangabeys and big baboons all swinging through the boughs here! "
Lake Kivu,"While Lake Kivu is hardly a single destination, it&#8217;s worth a special mention on its own simply because of the sheer wealth of attractions and activities it offers travelers to Rwanda from its place on the extreme western border of the country. Covering a vast area of more than 2,700 square kilometers, it ranges from Gisenyi in the north to the multicultural island of Ishwa in the south. Along the way, visitors will be able to spot rustic fishing villages on stilts, clusters of trademark catamaran skiffs on the water, a speckling of pretty tropical islands, and perhaps even the more modern outlines of industrious natural gas extractors above the lake. "
Gisuma,"Gisuma is Rwanda&#8217;s coffee king. Set amidst the foothills and sylvan valleys that rise to the Nyungwe Forest, the town is just a small speck on the map. But, thanks to its tasty beans and potent caffeine-infused brews, it&#8217;s risen to become well-known by baristas and coffee enthusiasts the world over. Today, the industry is headed by the ethical Gisuma co-operative organization, which has increased the take-home pay of local growers in the region by as much as 45% since it began. And even if you don&#8217;t like the black tipple, the area around Gisuma is beautiful to behold: rolling fields of coffee bushes peaking and dipping with the topography of the mountains all around. "
Nyagatare,"Nestled deep in the granite-carved valleys of Rwanda&#8217;s north-eastern provinces, the city of Nyagatare is not only the best gateway for exploring the verdant and biodiverse reaches of the Akagera National Park, but also an interesting little backwater town in its own right. As many as 100,000 people call it home, breathing life into the ad hoc craft markets and the university campus that pepper the city center. And then there are the rustic hamlets that dot the hills close by, encompassed by landscapes of croc-spotted rivers and hippo-heavy swamps. "
Ruhengeri,"Visitors to the northern town of Ruhengeri can&#8217;t help but look up; up to where the mist-shrouded peaks of the mighty Virunga Mountains raise the horizon; to where great beasts like the mountain gorilla roam the verdant forests. In fact, those natural draws (namely the Volcanos National Park) are pretty much the main attraction here, and the wealth of safari outfitters and package touts offering gorilla stalking expeditions is testimony to the fact. That said, Ruhengeri is a decent, charming place on its own. There are some great guesthouses, lively beer bars, and seriously awesome views from almost everywhere you go! "
Lake Muhazi,"Winding and weaving like an East African snake through the hills of Rwanda&#8217;s Eastern Province, the waters of Lake Muhazi have long represented a favorite rest, recuperation and relaxation spot for dwellers of the capital at Kigali. The banks are spotted with secluded picnic points, and there&#8217;s even a popular country club offering volleyball courts, quiet cabanas on the shore, eateries, and bike and boat rentals. The enchanting towns of Gahini and Rwesero are perfect stopovers for people making their way here, with just a clutch of great homestays to kick-back in before touring the nearby coffee fields and Catholic cathedrals. "
Kibungo,"For a taste of off-the-beaten-track Rwanda, why not make a beeline for the little town of Kibungo. Set in the east of the country, this provincial capital boasts a collection of higher education institutions (cue a population of term-time students to boot), and the lively stalls and shopping areas of the Kibungo Central Market. The spot also has a small offering of places to stay, making it a convenient one in which to rest the head on the way through to the Tanzanian border in the south, or to the waters of Lake Muhazi just to the north-west. "
Gishwati Forest National Park,"Sprawled over the hilltops just a short distance from beaches and resorts of Lake Kivu and Gisenyi, the Gishwati Forest National Park is now right on the forefront of Rwandan conservation. After mass migrations of refugees to the hinterland in the 1990s, during the genocide, the area suffered heavily from deforestation. Today, evidence of this can be seen in the bare ridges and rolling meadows within. However, efforts are being made to rejuvenate the wilderness, and there are programs in place to plant thousands of new trees by 2020. Still, there&#8217;s no denying the reserve is beautiful, with green highlands and woods that house L&#8217;Hoest&#8217;s monkeys and chimps! "
Rocca Guaita and Torre Cesta,"Perhaps the best known of all of San Marino’s attractions, Rocca Guaita and Torre Cesta are two fortress towers situated on a ridge at the summit of Mount Titano. The towers are part of a set of three that feature on the official flag of San Marino, and visitors can visit and tour the towers, the earliest of which, Rocca Guaita, dates from the 13th century. The two towers are usually visited together and Torre Cesta has a traditional weaponry museum on site. From the top of the towers there are stunning views that stretch as far as the Dalmatian Coast, as well as over the nearby Apennines. On top of Mount Titano, and surrounding the towers, you will find food and drink stands, souvenir stalls, and tourist kiosks. "
Torre del Montale,"The third tower atop Mount Titano, Torre del Montale, can be accessed by walking a little further along the bluff from Torre Cesta and Rocca Guaita. Torre del Montale is sadly not open to the public, but it is well worth making the trip along the marked footpath that skirts the ridge of Mount Titano to see it, as you will find even more spectacular views over San Marino, as well as several quaint spots to relax with a picnic as you take in the unspoilt scenary. "
Mount Titano,"Aside from the main path that leads to the tower, there are other marked walking trails that take you through picturesque and lush woodlands that give you a different perspective to the more crowded city centre down below. You will find old stone benches dotting the mountain that are the ideal place to relax as you take in the vistas, and as Mount Titano is found at an elevation of 750 metres above sea level, the mountain air is crisp and bracing, so be prepared for it to be cooler than the lower regions of the state and plan accordingly. "
Vampire Museum,"San Marino, the capital city of which is also called San Marino, may be small but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have a lot going on in terms of the museum scene, and anyone who likes a stroll around an exhibition won’t be disappointed here. San Marino seems to specialise in quirky museum topics and with that in mind, and apart from the National Museum, there are a whole host of niche museums to visit on a trip here. One of these is the Museum of Torture, featuring a range of torture devices through the ages that is a slightly macabre but highly interesting place to visit. If you are in the mood for something a little lighter then you can head to the Wax Museum that features a wide selection of famous historical characters through the ages as well as several nods to the history of San Marino so you can learn about its development and influencers at the same time. There is even a coin and stamp museum for those who want to learn about the history of the currency and postage of San Marino. "
Faetano,"The town of Faetano is one of the nine communes that make up the catelli of San Marino and used to be part of neighbouring Rimini in Italy until it became part of San Marino in the 15th century. A sleepy area of San Marino with little over 1,000 inhabitants, visitors make the trip to Faetano to see the Church of San Paolo Apostolo as well as the quaint town hall. Visitors can spend a tranquil day wandering the small streets of Faetano and taking in the local atmosphere as well as trying some of the local food and wines. "
Montegiardino,"Another of the nine communes of San Marino, Montegiardino is most famous for being a university town, the only one in San Marino in fact, and home to the University of the Republic of San Marino. The town is often described as the most beautiful of all San Marino and it has the relaxed and intellectual vibe of university towns the world over. Said to date from the Roman period, Montegiardino is stepped in history and you can enjoy the well established cafe culture here as you while away a few hours trying the local food and drink including special flat bread sandwiches called piadina that are also popular in the neighbouring provinces of Italy. "
Borgo Maggiore,"Borgo Maggiore started life as a sleepy village and has grown into the modern town which is one the largest residential areas in San Marino. Borgo Maggiore is most famous for its street markets that are held every Thursday from early in the morning until around 2pm. The first markets ever held in Borgo Maggiore (previously known as Mercatale) are said to have taken place in the 13th century, so if you come here know that you are shopping in a place with a long and proud history. The markets used to sell cattle but in the present day you are more likely to find fresh local produce and household wares as well as arts and crafts from the region. The town is also connected to the city of San Marino by a funicular which allows you to enjoy the beautiful vistas over the state as you ascend. "
Serravalle,"Another of the castelli of San Marino, Serravalle is the largest municipality in the state and lies at the foot of the Apennine Mountains. The town dates from medieval times and was previously a small village named ‘The Village of the Elm Trees’. Places of interest in Serravalle are the Serravalle Castle which feature on the castello’s coat of arms, as well as Saint Andrea’s Church built in the 19th century. In terms of modern architecture, check out the Olympic Stadium, something of a misnomer and not actually linked to the Olympic Games, but rather the national stadium used predominately for football matches. "
San Marino Jazz Festival,"If you enjoy festivals and happen to be visiting San Marino during the month of July, then you will have plenty of choice, as the state features the renowned San Marino Jazz Festival in the city of Borgo Maggiore, as well as the Adriatic Music Festival. For something more quirky, look out for the Medieval Days festival which features period costumes, food, games, and arts and crafts as San Marino goes back to its roots and celebrates all things medieval in the state. "
Piazza della Liberta,"Come to Piazza della Liberta for one of San Marino’s best loved traditions, the changing of the guard ceremony with the Guardie di Rocca. The Guardie are known for their green uniforms and red pompom hats, and the changing of the guard happens on the hour every hour during daylight hours in the summer months. After you have enjoyed this engaging traditional spectacle, head down the single main street that leads off Piazza della Liberta which is packed with restaurants, cafes, and charming boutiques that sell local handicrafts including San Marino’s most famous items, its duty-free products and exquisite ceramics. "
Dogana,"The town of Dogana is found in the north of San Marino near the border with Rimini and as such the town is used as the main entry and exit point for visitors wishing to travel to San Marino. The name Dogana literally translates as ‘Customs House’ although there are no border checkpoints as you enter or exit San Marino, and the main buses that run from Italy into the state usually stop at several shopping malls that are located in Dogana. Here you can pick up duty-free items and souvenirs including local arts and crafts products. "
National Museum,"Wander down to Palazzo Pergami Belluzzi where you will find the National Museum that has an eclectic mix of Neolithic pieces, Roman artefacts, and even Egyptian and Byzantine historical works. The museum also features a range of artwork dating from as early as the 17th century as well as early examples of San Marino currency. There are over 5,000 excellently preserved and presented curiosities in the National Museum which will take you through the history of San Marino as well as that of the wider region. The museum has been supported over the years by a great many prominent Italian public figures, from politicians, to artists, to celebrities, and many of the works on display here are the result of donations. "
Righi la Taverna,"The food in San Marino is, as you would expect, heavily influenced by Italian flavours and ingredients, with an emphasis on pasta dishes, fresh local produce, and plenty of flowing wine. Distinctly Sammarinese however, are Faggioli con le cotiche, a kind of bean and bacon soup that is perfect for the milder winter months, as well as Torta Tre Monti, a favourite Sammarinese desert. Many visitors from surrounding Italy also come to San Marino for two famous products, the wine and the local truffles which are quite the delicacy here. The city of San Marino is said to have some of the best restaurants in the whole of the state. "
Palazzo Pubblico,"Palazzo Pubblico is easily recognisable in San Marino due to its Gothic style and the ornate facade. Palazzo Pubblico is the official Town Hall of the state and all the main government events and ceremonies take place here. The building is made from stone taken from neighbouring Mount Titano, and dates from the 1800s. As you approach you will notice a square clock tower that tops the building and features battlements that echo Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Well worth a visit, there is a staircase located inside the building that leads to the top tower. "
Basilica di San Marino,"Dating from the early part of the nineteenth century, the Basilica di San Marino was actually built upon the remains of a Roman church that originally stood in the fourth century. The Basilica is famous for housing the bones of the patron saint of San Marino, Saint Marinus, which are stored in an urn, and there is a high alter that features a statue of the saint. The basilica has seven alters in all that are ornate and intricate in design, and visitors should also take the time to explore the paintings within Basilica di San Marino which are exquisite in their craftsmanship. "
Sao Tome,"A chocolate box of beautiful Romanesque churches and ornate colonial buildings, palm-lined boulevards and pretty plazas, Sao Tome is the only real city on these islands. The capital, and the economic hub, the political center and the main marketplace, it&#8217;s loaded with the likes of the Presidential Palace and Independence Square – marking the year that this Atlantic archipelago gained freedom from the powers of Europe. Delve into the Central Market here and weave between terracotta-tiled townhouses, beautiful Baroque facades and the cannon-dotted bulwarks of Fort Sao Sebastian, all before hitting the fascinating exhibitions of the National Museum. After that, you&#8217;ll discover lazy coffee shops spilling onto the cobbles, and plenty of places for strolling along the shoreline of beautiful Ana Chaves Bay. "
Obo National Park,"Otherworldly and awesome, the Obo National Park is one that rarely fails to take the breath away. Covering a vast area of more than 230 square kilometers on the southern side of Sao Tome, the great wilderness ranges from salt-washed mangroves on the shore to virgin Atlantic rainforests in the highlands. And what highlands they are! Crowned by the mighty, needle-like bluff of Pico Cao Grande, the park soars straight into the clouds. And along the coast, the mountains take the form of great square-cut escarpments; lofty and proud above the waves of the Atlantic Ocean below. Safaris and treks here will reveal beautiful tropical backcountry, along with grey parrots, mona monkeys and oodles of uber-rare birds! "
Santo António,"The capital of tiny little Principe – the smaller half of this archipelago – is a pint-sized town on the north shore of the island, and home to the bulk of its population (and that&#8217;s just above only 1,000 individuals!). A sleepy place of age-stained colonial edifices and mud-splattered pueblo-style homes, it&#8217;s got a certain authentic charm. The winding channels of the Palhota River cut through the heart of the town, bisecting the seaside streets as they weave along the shore through palm groves and swamp flats. Meanwhile, the verdant volcanic hills of the island&#8217;s inland beckon on the horizon, and local fishermen bob in their boats by the riparian jetties. "
Club Santana Resort,"A popular spot for beach lovers and luxury seekers in search of Sao Tome&#8217;s fabled cocktail of sand, sea and sun on the Atlantic, the little town of Santana spills down to the shoreline on the eastern edge of the island, emerging from the lanky palms of the jungle and the volcanic hills like some forgotten village in the land of Robinson Crusoe. It&#8217;s known mainly for the acclaimed Club Santana Resort, which offers bungalows and pretty cabanas just a stone&#8217;s throw from the golden sands of the Santana Beach. There are also rooms set atop the craggy bluffs along the shore, along with diving operators, boat tour opportunities and more. "
Monte Café,"You&#8217;ll have to head deep into the volcanic mountain ranges that rise to the skies in the heart of Sao Tome island to find the aged colonial factories and coffee-growing haciendas of Monte Cafe. As you might imagine, even the drive there is one for the travel journals: sweeping vistas of primeval rainforest; endless valleys of misty woods; the occasional rusting hamlet of tin-shack homes. Once there, you&#8217;ll enjoy beautiful views of the palm-dotted highlands of the country, along with one acclaimed coffee museum, chronicling the cultivation, sales and history of the island&#8217;s major industry. "
Rolas Island,"Languishing in the Atlantic like the teardrop of Sao Tome, just a short boat ride away from the southern tip of the island, the speck on the map that is Rolas Island is famed for its sparkling white-sand beaches and paradisiacal veneer. The sands are invariably totally secluded, cascading down from the jungle-covered coast in a medley of boulder-spotted coves and long stretches of sun-splashed ivory hues. There&#8217;s also an acclaimed hotel resort here (perfect for a remote and romantic tropical stay away from the archipelago&#8217;s more-trodden spots), along with a monument to the courses of the equator, which crosses right over the middle of Rolas. "
Trindade &#8211; Sao Tome,"Trindade is one of the few possible destinations in Sao Tome that&#8217;s not on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, this small town sits high above the capital, atop the rising ridges of the inland hills. It&#8217;s surrounded by the great swathes of coffee plantations and cacao growing fields (the main economic drivers here) that make up the larger Me-Zochi District. However, it’s the haunting and dilapidated character of the old colonial frontispieces that really strike visitors to the town &#8211; they stand like ghosts of a former age all along the pot-holed roads. "
Boca de Inferno,"The curious geological formations that poke out to meet the swells of the Atlantic on the eastern shore of Sao Tome find their zenith with the strikingly-named Boca de Inferno (that&#8217;s Hell&#8217;s Mouth in English). Visitors flock to this spot just a short drive south of the capital, to see as the salty whitecaps crash against the shore, and the currents draw water into a subterranean cave, all before they shoot sky high like some marine geyser. The sight is really something on its own; made all the better by the gorgeous black-rock cliffs and volcanic headlands jutting out and erupting from the coast all around. "
Jale Beach,"For folk who flock to Sao Tome to see the rare phenomenon of turtles clambering over the beaches and laying their eggs, there&#8217;s perhaps no better destination than the arc of golden sand that is Jale Beach. Curving its way around the bends of the southern coast, this bay is known as one of the top places to spot endangered sea turtles during the mating season. It&#8217;s also popular with local swimmers, and there&#8217;s a clutch of rustic beach huts made out of bamboo and palm boughs – if you don&#8217;t mind bedding down to a backing track of crashing Atlantic waves, with no electricity and mod cons, that is! "
Porto Alegre,"Porto Alegre is hardly anything like its Brazilian namesake. Instead of one million inhabitants, this one clocks up just over 500 in total. Instead of endless barrios and sprawling modern districts, this town is a ramshackle conglomeration of earthy huts, stilted longhouses and faded fishing canoes. Still, it&#8217;s got real charm, and is one of the starting points on the Sao Tome whale watching circuit (which runs the length of the east coast). It&#8217;s also a great place to launch further explorations along the pretty beaches of the south shore – Jale, paradisiacal Praia Piscina – and the gorgeous reaches of Rolas Island to boot. "
Dakar,"Dakar has seriously outgrown its perch on the Cap-Vert Peninsula. It now sprawls eastwards into the arid dust plains to the east, and bursts out over the dockside jetties in a medley of lively trader ships and fish-scented marketplaces. The port is what has driven the boom in both population and size, not to mention imbued the city with an enticing multiculturalism and energy. So, be sure to drop by the curious Soviet-esque rises of the African Renaissance Monument, the acclaimed Museum of African Arts, and the old Dutch slave trade ruins on Goree Island, before delving into the curious medley of Lebanese eateries African embroidery bazaars, roasted peanut stalls and raucous beer bars around wild Sandaga Market. "
Faidherbe Bridge,"There&#8217;s actually not as much separating the Saint-Louis of northern Senegal and its namesake across the great Atlantic pond in the Deep South of America as you might think. Check out the arched steel construction of the Faidherbe Bridge, straddling the Senegal River like something on the Mississippi. Or, delve into the heart of the old city of Saint-Louis to discover the French-style colonial builds, whitewashed frontispieces in the plantation style, and shady arcades. There are even famous jazz fests held here every May! Still, the similarities do end eventually, especially as you dip into the salt-washed fishing hamlets of Guet N&#8217;Dar, or begin wonder at the craggy cliffs and exotic creatures of the Barbarie Peninsula. "
Ziguinchor,"A patchwork of pastel-painted colonial builds and age-stained frontispieces dressed in European filigrees and Parisian designs, there&#8217;s no denying the immersive colonial character of Ziguinchor. And while the major sights here are few and far between – the bustling Marche Saint Maur des Fosses, the curious roundabouts of the Place Jean-Paul II – the real draw is the earthy African character of the place. What&#8217;s more, Ziguinchor also happens to be the gateway of choice to the Casamance region: a place where pirogue canoes weave along the river ways, and the plains of the Sahel begin to transform into verdant Guinean woods. "
Natural Reserve of Popenguine,"Located south of the capital, on the panhandle of the Cap-Vert Peninsula, the small town of Popenguine is the gateway to one truly beautiful medley of natural attractions. The main draw has to be the protected Natural Reserve of Popenguine, which boasts a clean and pretty boulder-peppered beach, nestled between two arid headlands of dramatic cliffs. The area also boasts the rugged rock walls of the Cap de Naz, jutting out into the Atlantic, and a particularly famous lagoon, where nesting birds of all shapes and sizes draw crowds of spotters throughout the year. "
Great Mosque,"The epicenter of the mystical Mouride order of the Sufis, Touba emerges from the rolling Sahel of central Senegal with its colossal Great Mosque, looming minarets, and countless other pilgrimage shrines and attractions (not least of all the tomb of the Mouride founder himself: Shaikh Aamadu Bamba Mbakke). The town booms with visitors during the yearly Grand Magal, when thousands come to honor the social and Islamic programs of the Sufi scholar and teacher. The focal point is the majestic mosque, which is strictly run and has some gorgeous arabesque interiors and one soaring 87-meter-high minaret known as the Lamp Fall. "
Joal-Fadiouth,"The fascinating fishing town of Joal-Fadiouth is one that time forgot. Alive with salt-stained timber pirogues and oodles of bobbing jetties, the town&#8217;s locals still utilize the age-old hand catching techniques of centuries gone by. They can be seen haggling over prices of huge swordfish all along the coast by morning, while the eateries – unsurprisingly – serve up some of the best seafood in the country. Meanwhile, the island of Fadiouth across the bay is another one to write home about – it&#8217;s almost totally formed from accumulations of sea shells! "
Casamance coast,"Laid-back little Kafountine is the place to come and sample the undeniable beauties of the Casamance coast. Great long stretches of golden sand are what draw most of the people here. They run the gamut from wide bays washed by the rollers of the Atlantic to bustling strips peppered with the faded fishing pirogues of the locals closer to the town. And then there&#8217;s the croc-spotted riparian habitats of the Foret des Narangs nearby, where rare birds flit through the canopies, macaques swing overhead, and wild West African creatures roam the undergrowth. "
Tambacounda,"Sat on a far-flung crossroads, the town of Tambacounda is often visited by travelers starting a West African odyssey through the countries of Gambia, Guinea-Bissau or Guinea to the south. However, those who can suffer the scorching Sahelian climate just a little longer will discover an interesting spot; a place where a couple of French colonial remnants still mark the streets and earthy farming communities dominate the backcountry. Tambacounda is also one of the best jump off points for explorations in the legendary Niokolo-Koba National Park – the upland reaches of the mighty Gambia River. "
Kaolack,"Situated on a small headland that bubbles out into the meanders of the Saloum River, the town of Kaolack is known as a center of Islamic teaching, and as an industrial hub of Senegalese salt production. Its attractions start with the vast central square of Medina Baye – look up to see the turquoise-domed tops of the great minarets. Kaolack Market then comes with a heady fray of lean-to shops and ramshackle sellers, while the rustic reaches of Coofog are dotted with bulbous baobab trees and tell stories of the historic Serer Kingdom that once ruled in these parts. "
Kedougou,"Nestled in the far south-eastern corner of the country, where the Guinean forests spill out and down to the Sahelian plains, the city of Kedougou has a character all of its own. For starters, its geography and topography are unlike any other area in the nation – expect lush rainforests and verdant, mist-topped hills. Kedougou also gets quite a lot of rain, giving rise to oodles of agricultural land in the surrounding region (for those who don&#8217;t mine gold, that is). And then there&#8217;s the wonderful reaches of the Niokolo-Koba National Park: a huge swathe of greenery where the Gambia River erupts in the company of hippos, lions, elephants and leopards. "
Mboro,"Mboro is an interesting little place that can be reached in just over an hour from the capital city at Dakar. It&#8217;s the hub of one of the most fertile regions in the nation, and produces oodles of vegetables to fill the bustling markets of the city to the south. Mboro has an immersive market of its own too, and visitors love flitting between the food stalls and colorful farmer emporiums here, haggling for the curious local tie-dye costumes and tasty preserves. The beach is another must, and although swimming can be risky, simply settling on the sands and watching the fishermen and luminescent plankton in the rollers is a real treat! "
Palmarin,"Encompassed by great swathes of verdant mangroves, brackish lagoons and salt flats to the east, and stretches of chart-topping Atlantic beachfronts to the north, the town of Palmarin might be hard to get to (there are hardly any real roads connecting this one with the greater infrastructure of Senegal), but it&#8217;s certainly got its fair share of attractions. There are dense groves of palm trees to wander, palm tree wine to taste, and some excellent sands close to the center, not to mention packs of wild hyenas around town, folksy wrestling competitions, and even ancient burial mounds attributed to the Sereer folk. "
Fatick,"While Fatick itself is hardly a chart-topper, and will likely never make the headlines of travel brochures with its humble boulevards and dusty cottages, its surrounding region is certainly something to write home about. Peppered with the relics of ancient Serer prehistory, the hinterlands on the edge of the town are home to curious carved megaliths and totems dating as far back as the 9th century. You&#8217;ll find thousands of old tumulus houses between the xeric woods of the old Baol, countless religious shrines, and places holy to the Serer religion. "
Thies,"Cheaper than the capital and a cheerful place all round, Thies is often used as an alternative overnight stop for expats and visitors who don’t like the frantic energy of Dakar. It fulfils the role perfectly, and the dusty streets here are laden with smiling and welcoming locals, a few charming (if ramshackle beer bars) and some decent shops. Thies is primarily a market town too, which means you can get a taste of the haggling and hawking that defines Senegal&#8217;s mercantile side. There are also some good spots to sample local menus of benachin rice and fish – just look for the joints in the center. "
Richard Toll,"Curiously-named Richard Toll, a town just a stone&#8217;s throw from the border with Mauritania in the extreme north of the country, still finds a way to honor its one-time park planner, the botanist Jean Michel Claude Richard. An interesting place that fuses cultures, it comes to life with the bustle of Xhouma Market, awash with sugar traders and craft stalls aplenty. There are also some relics of the French colonial age to see, like the muddied face of the grand Chateau de Baron Roger. Richard Toll also has an industrial edge, with refineries and fishing depots lining the river. "
Belgrade,"Serbia’s capital Belgrade is located at the intersection between the Danube and the Sava rivers, and is an eclectic, if sometimes arresting, mix of old and new styles, from 19th century buildings to Art Nouveau structures. There is a little bit of everything in Belgrade, including the dominating Kalemegdan Fortress, located in Kalemegdan Park, the remains of which stand today. The park is also home to the Military Museum that even features the remnants of a US Stealth Bomber for those keen to learn about the military history of the region. Aside from the fortress there are Orthodox churches, colourful facades, and quaint squares aplenty, but for something more unexpected head over to the island of Ada Cinganlija or ‘Gypsy Island’ in the south of Belgrade to find yourself at something of a self styled beach resort. Here you will find beaches that stretch along the banks of the Sava, and you can enjoy swimming, water sports like waterskiing, and a large area of parkland for those who enjoy checking out the local plant and wildlife. <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>Tip</strong></span>: Have a look at the <a href=""http://bednbeerhostel.com/"">Bed &#8216;n&#8217; Beer Hostel</a> if you&#8217;re looking for a place to stay. <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Tours</span></strong>: For tours check out <a href=""http://tetserbia.com/"">Travel &amp; Event Team Serbia</a> "
Fruška Gora Mountain and National Park,"Located in the region of Syrmia, Fruška Gora Mountain is found on the border with neighbouring Croatia, and is affectionately known as the ‘Jewel of Serbia’. The mountain region includes a protected area known as Fruška Gora Park, and is studded with vineyards and wineries that are well worth a visit for grape enthusiasts. Rambling, hiking, climbing and picnicking are all popular pursuits in the region, but perhaps the biggest draw here are the Orthodox monasteries that are scattered all over the countryside, some of which are said to date back to the 12th century and are now protected. The scenery here is spectacular, and many visitors come to enjoy the stunning views and unhurried pace that allows you to explore the region at your leisure. "
Sokobanja,"Serbia is well known for its spa towns, once the retreat of choice of Roman emperors, and none more so than the town of Sokobanja in the east of the country. Locals and celebrities flock here for the thermal waters that are said to have deeply healing properties, and there is a public ‘hamam’ or steam room that dates from the 17th century. As well as the hot springs, visitors also travel to Sokobanja for the crisp air said to be high in negative ions and free from air pollution due to the increased elevation, leading to the phrase ‘climatic spa’ to describe the treatment that breathing in the fresh air provides. "
Vinca,"The region of Vinca, located outside of Belgrade, is one of the most important places in the history of Serbia, as it is home to the archaeological site Belo brdo, meaning ‘White Hill’. The area was made famous by the archaeological finds uncovered in Vinca, many made of stone or bone, including statues, ornaments, and drinking vessels, and visitors can tour the site as well as the museum that showcases these examples of Neolithic culture that are said to date from approximately 5,000 to 4,000 BC. Vinca is also known as a stop off point for river cruises along the Danube, and the local docks are famous for the fish restaurants that dot the neighbourhood for those who want to try some of the freshly caught fish on offer. "
Kopaonik,"If you like winter sports and happen to be visiting Serbia during the winter season, from December to April, then come to the Kopaonik mountain range and get ready to hit the slopes, whatever your level of ability or previous experience. There are a whopping twenty four ski lifts that service the area, and categories of slopes of all levels to choose from, as well as skiing and snowboarding available at the Kopaonik Ski Resort. If you happen to be travelling out of ski season, then there is still plenty to enjoy in Kopaonik, as you can partake in mountain climbing, hiking, and bird watching. Also of interest for hikers or ramblers are the wooden buildings that are plentiful in the region and include timbre shrines and churches. "
Lepenski Vir,"A famous site in the central Balkan Peninsula, Lepenski Vir dates from approximately 9,000 to 6,000 BC and features important archaeological relics that budding archaeologists are sure to love. The site features displaced and preserved buildings and sculptures, many of which feature fish motifs, as well as shrines and river stones said to represent ancient gods. The site also displays figurines from 7,000 BC in the form of pre-historic men and women in expressionistic styles. "
Niš,"The third largest city in Serbia, located in the south of the country, Niš is known for being a university town as well as the birthplace of the Roman emperor Constantine. As such, there is a relaxed and fun-loving vibe to the city, as well as a number of attractions of historical importance, not least the Memorial of Constantine the Great, proudly on show in the centre of the city. Another place of historic note in Niš is the Niš Fotress, built in the 18th century, and it is here that the two sides of the city expertly meet, as the area in front of the fortress is home to rows of cafes that are much loved by the student population looking for some rest and relaxation. "
Zlatibor and Zlatar mountains,"The Zlatar Mountain Range, topped by the highest peak Golo brdo, is not a particularly well kept secret in Serbia, as locals flock here to enjoy all that the region has to offer. The area is full of meadows, lakes, and forests, and its elevation and fresh air have put it on the map as a kind of spa location for those looking to relax and commune with nature far away from the sprawling cities. During the colder months, those who enjoy winter sport can indulge in skiing on the many slopes accessible via a dedicated ski lift that provides stunning views over the lush valleys beneath. There are also three artificial lakes that offer opportunities for boating, rafting, and fishing, as well as a number of picturesque wooden churches and monasteries scattered around the countryside. "
Leskovac,"If you come to the city of Leskovac in southern Serbia for one thing only, then make sure that it’s the meat. The city attracts hordes of visitors for its annual Roštiljijada or Barbecue Week held in September, a festival that celebrates all things grilled meat over a period of five days of revelry. To fully get into the meaty spirit, the main section of the city is closed off from cars, and food stalls set up in order for traders to show off their wares, and cooking competitions, music events, and performances are also held. "
Oplenac Mausoleum,"Oplenac, in western Serbia, offers a completely different view of the country, and is an important cultural and historical site due to the St George Church and the Oplenac Mausoleum. The church, also known as Oplenac Church is an Orthodox church built in the 1900s that is also the final resting place of King Peter I, and the mausoleum section itself houses the remains of 26 members of the Karadordevic royal family. The church and mausoleum are said to be some of the most beautiful buildings in all of Serbia, in particular due to the decorative and impressive mosaics that cover the inside. "
Novi Sad,"The second largest city in Serbia, Novi Sad is the capital of Vojvodinia Province, and is a stop on the tourist circuit that is definitely not to be missed. The city is perhaps most famous for its dominating landmark, the Petrovaradin Fortress, a protected building that dates from the 17th century and keeps a watchful eye over the city, as well as the EXIT music festival that is held annually in July, and is said to be one of the key summer music festivals to attend in the whole of Europe. Picturesque spots in the city are also plentiful such as the Varadin Bridge that spans the Danube, and you can also enjoy river cruises to take in the city from the water if you prefer. For those who like history and culture, visit the Stari Grad area of the city, where you will find war memorials, museums, art galleries, bars, and cafes that make it the perfect place to wander the streets and soak in the atmosphere. "
Mokra Gora,"Mokra Gora is a lush valley with spectacular landscape that also houses the village of the same name whose claim to fame is its period railway. The village has been restored to resemble its original state in days gone by, and a must-do activity here is to visit the famous railway station and take a train ride through the Mokra Gora valley, taking in all the sights along the way. The track is shaped like a figure eight and neatly loops back to Mokra Gora at the end of the trip. "
Drvengrad,"If you fancy doing something a little different in Serbia then don’t miss out on another attraction in the Mokra Gora valley, this time Drvengard or ‘Timber Town’. The village was actually originally built as a film set by local director Emir Kusturica for the film ‘Life is a Miracle, and the village has stood ever since and is now a fully running ethnic open-air museum. With a strong dedication to the arts, there are film festivals, music concerts, art classes, and workshops held at Drvengrad throughout the year. "
Sirogojno,"Close to Mokra Gora you will find the quaint village of Sirogojno that also features an open-air museum or self styled ‘ethnic village’ that includes period timbre structures like a traditional Serbian dairy, an inn, and a bakery. Locals are on hand to demonstrate traditional arts and crafts from the region, and Sirogojno is said to be an excellent place to sample the local food and drink, with traditional Serbian dishes lovingly prepared from recipes handed down over centuries. If you want to try the local tipple then you can have a glass or two of ‘rakija’, a Serbian brandy. "
Drina River,"If you want to experience an adrenalin rush in the great outdoors then head to the west of Serbia to explore its wealth of majestic scenery and extreme sports options. Of these, the Drina River is known as a great spot for those who want to try their hand at white water rafting, and you can sign up with a number of local companies who will take you out on the water with trained guides who will show you how to raft safely as well as talking you through the diverse flora and fauna in the region as you float by. "
Beau Vallon,"Beau Vallon is the Seychelles of the postcards and travel brochures. Lined with sand so white you&#8217;d think it had been painted, dotted with the red-roofed villas of countless resort hotels, and washed over by a sea of such perfect blue, it&#8217;s a quintessential image of the tropical Indian Ocean. It&#8217;s also really easily accessed from the capital at Victoria, and comes with countless beaches worth their salt: Anse Major with its cobalt shore; Baie Ternay, where sharks and manta rays flit through the water. International eateries tout everything from pizza to haute French cuisine, watersports abound, and prices are reasonable to boot. "
Silhouette Island,"Look for the silhouette of Silhouette Island across from the sands of Beau Vallon and Cap Ternay on Mahe and you won&#8217;t be disappointed – this great granite rock pokes high above the horizon just 20 miles away. However, it wasn&#8217;t actually named for its profile in the distance, but rather the French minister who discovered it. It&#8217;s the luxurious edge that really counts here, and the beaches. These come shimmering as white as a pearl, backed by opulent resorts bearing names like Hilton. And there are hidden coves of black sand too, peppered with boulders and shrouded by packs of palms. "
Victoria,"Victoria is a place that balances the responsibilities of a capital with the laid-back obligations of an Indian Ocean half-city. Small and walkable, this one oozes a sort of Creole Carib vibe that keeps things endearingly slow and chilled out. Colonial builds fringe the streets with their whitewashed faces and arcades out of New Orleans pop up on the corners. Colorful market halls bustling with equally colorful tropical fruits and veg; the locals chatter over coffees, and the scents of vanilla and fresh fish emanate from the bazaars. As the capital, Victoria is also home to the interesting National Museum – definitely worth a visit! "
Vallee de Mai National Park,"Black parrots meet coco de mer palm blooms amidst the verdant reaches of the Vallee de Mai National Park; one of the Seychelles&#8217; most amazing UNESCO reserves and a veritable dream come true for any nature loving traveler in these parts. Weaving, winding hiking trails follow three main routes around the area that sits in the heart of Praslin, and walkers can keep company with rare creatures like the tiger chameleon and chirping geckos aplenty. It&#8217;s hardly a wonder that the park was once thought to be the literal Garden of Eden, you&#8217;ll see! "
La Digue,"Great granite rocks crumble into the azure waves of the Indian Ocean and palms flap left to right in the Trade Winds all around the coast of picture-perfect La Digue. As the third-largest inhabited island in the Seychelles archipelago, this one often plays second fiddle to the touristic hotspots on Praslin and Mahe. But it shouldn&#8217;t. Not when the rock-studded sands of Anse Source d&#8217;Argent are amongst the country&#8217;s most romantic; or the craggy hills of the Veuve Nature Reserve host rare paradise flycatchers and giant tortoises stalk the beachfronts (slowly, mind you). "
the giant tortoise,"A whopping 1,100 kilometers south of Victoria, languishing on their own amidst the aquamarine waters of the Indian Ocean, is where travels will discover the islets and cays of the second-largest coral atoll on the planet: Aldabra. A mind-blowingly beautiful place, this one hosts powdery white sands and chiselled coral and rock formations that look like they&#8217;re from another planet. Way back in 1982, the whole atoll was designated by UNESCO for its rich biodiversity. That includes the likes of sharks, manta rays, coconut crabs, flying foxes and – last but certainly not least – the giant tortoise (Aldabra has more than 100,000 of these great beasts; the largest number on the planet!). "
Curieuse Island,"Curieuse Island has had its fair share of troubles. First, French colonists culled the local tortoise. Then mariners torched the whole rock in a bid to increase their yield of double-bulb coconuts (unique to the Seychelles). Finally, the whole place was designated a leper colony, and went untouched for decades. Today, the darker days are firmly gone, and Curieuse Island is now one of the top day trip destinations in the archipelago. Famed for its lush mangroves and rare coco de mer plant, its ochre-hued red soil and the biodiversity of the reefs and underwater habitats that surround it, there&#8217;s plenty on the menu for the nature lover. "
Cousin Island,"The stomping ground of the rare Hawksbill turtle, the uber-rare Seychelles warbler, and the Seychelles magpie robin (two of the exotic endemic species of the archipelago), Cousin Island actually started life as a coconut plantation. Today, the whole granite mass is a protected reserve, controlled under the auspices of international organisations like BirdLife, and drawing in crowds of bird spotters and turtle seekers during the season. The coast is also fringed with groves of coconut palms and casuarinas, there are eco-lodges and even a smattering of luxurious villas with spas, gyms and infinity pools overlooking the sea. "
Grand Anse,"A wide horseshoe curve of sparkling yellow-white sand that runs for much of the length of Praslin&#8217;s west coast, Grand Anse hails in as one of the longest beaches in the entire of the Seychelles. It&#8217;s also nice and close to the runways of Praslin Airport, comes peppered with charming hotels and guesthouses, and fringed by blooms of fragrant hibiscus and frangipani. The occasional whitewashed yacht dots the sky-blue waters, the Indian Ocean laps softly (making Grand Anse great for swimmers and snorkelers), and there are plenty of water sports outfitters hiding between the palm groves. What are you waiting for? "
Baie Lazare,"On the southern tip of Mahe island, the enchanting little salt-washed village of Baie Lazare marks the very spot where French mariner Lazare Picault first laid claim to the Seychelles for France, way back in the 1740s. History is one of the main draws, with the carved Gothic spires and frontispieces of one elegant church dedicated to Francis of Assisi standing as testimony to the European influence. However, the beaches are true chart-toppers too. They come in the form of uber-romantic Anse Soleil; its bendy palm trees bowing down to an ocean of perfect blue. Or they come with boulder-peppered Petite Anse – secluded, quiet and pristine. "
Morne Seychellois National Park,"Mist-topped canopies and chiselled cliffs cascade down from the highlands of northern Mahe island to form the great natural wonders of the Morne Seychellois National Park. A wild region, it encompasses the panoramic lookouts atop Morne Blanc, endless swathes of coastal mangrove, deep forest tracks and oodles more. Trekkers are invited to delve into the vast area and navigate through groves of ancient rosewood trees, seeking out Venus fly traps and brilliant white tropical birds, not to mention the age-old remains of some cinnamon factories. You&#8217;ll need good boots for this one folks! "
Aride Island,"Lost on its own between the swells of the Indian Ocean just north of Praslin island, the little speck that is Aride has become something of a focus for conservationists and naturalists in the Seychelles. Thanks to its resurgent population of interesting seabirds, protected marine reserves and relatively less development over the centuries than the archipelago&#8217;s other islets, it remains pretty feral. You&#8217;ll see the occasional bloom of coconut palms left over from the days when it was a plantation, along with rare blue pigeons and magpies, the shimmering sands of Turtle beach, and windblown cliffs to boot. "
Bird Island,"Rising just a couple of meters from the ocean some 100 kilometers north-east of Mahe, Bird Island is not only a far-flung speck on the map of the Seychelles archipelago, but also an untouched and untrodden break from the other tourist-heavy draws here. It really does live up to its name too, with everything from fairy terns and sooties, common noddies and more flitting through the salt-scented skies. And it&#8217;s not all about looking upwards either, because there are also winding hiking paths and huge giant tortoises to see – Bird Island is actually home to Esmeralda: the single heaviest giant tortoise in the world! "
Ste Anne National Marine Park,"Just a peppering of perfectly-sculpted islands rises from the protected seascapes of the Ste Anne National Marine Park: palm-studded Moyenne Island; the mountainous reaches of the beautiful Ile aux Cerfs; indelibly green Sainte Anne itself. And while these host luxury hotels and shimmering white beaches, they are certainly not the major pull. That honor goes to what&#8217;s under the water. SCUBA divers, free divers and boaters all flock to see the patchwork of seagrass meadows and coral reefs, the sharks and multi-colored schools of tropical fish, while others will come in search of the fabled treasure supposedly once buried in the sands! "
Denis Island,"Benefitting from its own tiny airstrip and a far-flung, off-the-beaten-track location on the northern fringes of the Seychelles archipelago, little Denis Island has nurtured something of a more Robinson Crusoe feel that its near compadres. It&#8217;s dressed in a blanket of coconut palms and pretty hardwood takamakas, and is home to turtle sanctuaries and driftwood-dotted beaches of pristine sands. The remoteness makes for a truly desert island experience, which means you won&#8217;t find any roaming internet here as you wander between the ramshackle salt-washed fishing villages and empty bays! "
Stokesay Castle,"A town of immense beauty, Ludlow has won constant acclaim for its architecture, food culture and enchanting street scenes. Some 500 buildings in the town are listed, and almost all of these are either half-timbered or have the flat fronts that were in style in the 1700s. Ludlow is a place made for milling around, not least because of its pavement cafes and markets six days a week. And when it comes to history Ludlow delivers in a big way: Stokesay Castle may well be the most complete medieval manor house in the country, while Ludlow Castle is a substantial ruin that&#8217;s a symbol of might for the Yorkist kings in the 15th century during the Wars of the Roses. Antiquarians can lose themselves in the drama that unfolded within these walls 500 years ago. "
Attingham Park,"Settled in a kink on the River Severn, Shrewsbury was the birthplace of naturalist Charles Darwin. There are Darwin references throughout the town, which is also rich with endearing Tudor and Georgian buildings. Like Ludlow, Shrewsbury is somewhere to get to know on foot, and has a lot of personality thanks to its independent shops on the high street and in the bustling Market Hall. As Shrewsbury is almost totally surrounded by water, a cruise on the Severn is a treat, floating below the town&#8217;s nine bridges. The Quarry, dating to 1719, is a heavenly park by the water with a landscaped parterre at the centre, known as the Dingle. Get to the Shrewsbury Museum to pore over the town&#8217;s former times and go see the neoclassical Attingham Park for a cultured excursion. "
Ironbridge,"This village is named for the original &#8220;Iron Bridge&#8221;, a 30-metre cast iron structure crossing the River Severn and breaking the mould when it was completed in 1779. The wider Ironbridge Gorge area is often labelled the &#8220;Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution&#8221;, and is a dreamland for scientists, historians or anybody fascinated by the technological advances made in the 18th and 19th centuries. And you can really indulge that interest because there are 35 historic sites and ten museums to uncover. What&#8217;s cool is that they all deal with a different trade or aspect of engineering, so there&#8217;s museum of iron, one devoted to china and one, the Broseley Pipeworks, where nearly all of the UK&#8217;s tobacco pipes were manufactured in Victorian times. "
Oswestry Shropshire Council,"In this ancient border town several locations and streets have Welsh names. This is the legacy of the Middle Ages when Oswestry was the subject of a tug of war between the English and Welsh. And as you go west from here the landscape becomes ever more rugged as you approach the Welsh Mountains. Closer to home you can investigate Oswestry&#8217;s ancient roots at the Iron Age Hill Fort, which is 3,000 years old and as intact as any in England. The playful and imaginative British Ironworks Centre combines an old-school forge with outlandish sculptures like a gorilla made with 40,000 spoons. "
Bridgnorth Castle Hill Railway,"The old town of Bridgenorth climbs precipitously from the banks of the Severn, and is split between the high town and low town by a sandstone cliff. In the 18th century this was one of Europe&#8217;s busiest river ports, with scores of barges laden with coal and pulled along the river by manpower. Earlier, in the 17th Century Charles I had declared the view of the Severn and meadows from the cliff-top to be the finest in all his kingdom. In the 19th century a funicular, the Bridgnorth Castle Hill Railway was installed and still makes 150 trips to the top every day. Embedded in gardens up here are the remnants of Bridgnorth Castle, which has a precarious-looking tower that makes the Leaning Tower of Pisa seem perpendicular. "
Hoo Farm Animal Kingdom,"Where Shropshire is mostly quiet and traditional, the largest town in the county is a fast-growing new town noted for high-tech industry. So Telford has a different quality to it, as a place of business, conventions at the International Centre and some serious shopping. In fact the core of the town is one gigantic shopping precinct, by far the largest in the county. The burgeoning population has a good selection of days out on hand, like the highly-rated Hoo Farm Animal Kingdom, while the 400-metre Wrekin Hill is a breeze from the town if you want some energising scenery. On the remnants of a Bronze Age hill-fort you can see as far south as Gloucestershire and as far north as Manchester&#8217;s Beetham Tower. "
Wollerton Old Hall Garden,"A cosy market town on the boundary with Staffordshire, Market Drayton is just the place if your idea of relaxation is to idle at florid country gardens. There are three to pick from, all a stone&#8217;s throw from the town. But expert green thumbs will love the whimsy and expertise on show at Wollerton Old Hall Garden, which is positively Tolkien-esque and laid out as a whole system of pockets and corners. Also look out for the Dorothy Clive Garden, which was plotted on top of a former gravel quarry in the 1940s and comes with a classic English tearoom. "
Church Stretton,"Woven into the Shropshire Hills in the southwest of the County, Church Stretton gained momentum as a holiday resort in the early-1900s. At this time it earned the sobriquet, &#8220;Little Switzerland&#8221;, which rings true when you see the bulky sandstone hillsides that press up against the town. The goal for most tourists has been the same for a century: To stride out into these landscapes and scale heights like the Long Mynd, a massive plateau that culminates at more than 500 metres. The paths aren&#8217;t to be taken lightly, but you&#8217;ll have heart-lifting scenes like the Carding Mill Valley as your reward. "
Wenlock Priory,"Frozen in time, the small town of Much Wenlock is like something out of a storybook for its black and white timber-framed houses, country pubs and cheerful speciality shops. The exceptional building here is the Tudor Guildhall, dating to the 1500s: A small flower market trades under the arcades on the ground floor and upstairs you can step inside the venerable room in which the town council would have met hundreds of years ago. Wenlock Priory is the romantic ruin of a 12th-century monastery suppressed by Henry VIII in the 16th century. Drop by Much Wenlock Museum, which tells the story of William Penny Brookes, the Victorian local doctor who founded the forerunner of the modern Olympic Games. "
The Mere,"In the low-lying northwest of the county, Ellesmere is a market town in the middle of a region of beautiful glacial lakes and ponds. The nearest and largest is simply known as &#8220;The Mere&#8221; and is a slice of paradise in summer. The banks are undisturbed and provide a nesting site for waterfowl like grey herons. You can wander along the waterside trail or hire a boat for a couple of hours before calling in at the Boathouse Restaurant. "
Whitchurch,"The oldest settlement in the county to still be inhabited, Whitchurch was founded by the Romans on a road that connected with the fortress at Chester to the north. Digs in the area have unearthed some enthralling artefacts that are among the 2,000 items displayed at the town&#8217;s Heritage Centre. Here you can also swot up on J.B. Joyce, the clock-making company set up in Whitchurch in 1690 and helped to build the iconic clock on London&#8217;s Elizabeth Tower. Whitchurch itself is a neat market town of quoined Georgian townhouses and the odd half-timbered building thrown in. And if you feel like stretching those legs, go for a light amble by the Llangollen Canal to see the impressive flight of Victorian locks up the hillside at Grindley Brook. "
Craven Arms,"Known as a Railway Town, Craven Arms was just a small village before the Welsh Marches line arrived and linked with the Heart of Wales railway. Owing to the majesty of the Shropshire Hills Craven soon began to attract walkers. Indeed, the Shropshire Hills Discover Centre is here and goes into some depth about the natural history of this sublime Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. And to round things off with a helping of kitsch, the Land of Lost Content is a strange assemblage of odds and ends like vintage sewing machines and vintage toys, and is deserving an hour or so. "
Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary,"Cascading down the green hills of the Western Area, right to the edge of its own horseshoe bay, the capital of Freetown is a fine place to begin your travels in the country. A cocktail of frantic port activity (the city is home to one of the largest natural deep-water harbors on the globe) and laid-back beachside living, it&#8217;s something of Sierra Leone writ small. You&#8217;ll see what we mean as you move between the powdery sands of Lakka Beach and Lumley, into the party strip of Aberdeen district, and out to the industrial sprawl of the suburbs. Oh, and don&#8217;t miss the amazing Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary, where mind-boggling primates will swing above your 4X4! "
Bunce Island,"Deep in the recesses of Tagrin Bay, just a short ferry ride from the jetties of the capital at Freetown, the rock that is Bunce Island offers a glimpse into the darker days of West African history. Just one of 40 individual citadels that were raised by the Europeans along the shoreline of the region during the heyday of the slave trade, the spot is known to have been one of the primary points where British vessels laden with captured people departed for the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia across the Atlantic. Today, visitors can come and see the preserved castile, and learn all about this sobering episode of Sierra Leone&#8217;s past. "
Banana Island,"Languishing off the coast of the Western Area, south from the capital at Freetown, the finger of land that forms Banana Island has all the shimmering, alabaster-hued beaches and lush rainforest you&#8217;d expect of a place so deep in the tropics. In fact, that cocktail of beautiful natural draws has made this one arguably the most popular weekend getaway from the big city, and there are now some good guesthouses in hotels in the fishing settlements of Dublin and Ricketts as a result. You can also head inland, and seek out the vine-clambered ruins of old colonial depots and slave processing centers. "
Tiwai Island,"Engulfed by the weaving, winding capillaries of the Moa River as the main channel splits in two in the heart of Sierra Leon&#8217;s Southern Province, Tiwai Island remains one of the most famous conservation spots in the country. A rare draw away from the coast, the riparian land is home to some of the last remaining virgin rainforest in Sierra Leone. And the wildlife is equally as totemic, with Diana monkeys and pygmy hippos, tool-using chimpanzees (a truly awesome feat) and curious pangolins all making the reserve their home. "
Turtle Islands,"The Turtle Islands might just be the most picture-perfect tropical paradise you&#8217;ve never heard of. Set out in the lapping swells of the Atlantic Ocean, this archipelago of eight is made from a patchwork of swaying palm blooms and mangrove, carved out by gorgeous white-sand beaches and empty bays of water so blue you&#8217;ll need to pinch yourself to believe it. Add to that a truly rustic set of locals and ramshackle bamboo-built villages, bobbing fishing skiffs and campsites right on the shore, and it&#8217;s easy to see why the Turtle isles deserve a visit. Just be sure to steer the boat away from Hoong, which is barred to visitors and used for coming-of-age religious rituals. "
Tokeh,"Bamboo parasols rustle in the Atlantic breezes; sands shimmer in gleaming yellow-golden hues; the salty whitecaps of the ocean buffet the palm-peppered shore: Welcome to Tokeh Beach – arguably the single most accomplished seaside resort in the entire of Sierra Leone. Thanks to its gorgeous coastal stretches, this little town east of Freetown and in the heart of the Western Area Rural District has grown up with countless luxury hotels and guesthouses. In fact, it&#8217;s been noted for its touristic potential since at least the 1960s, when one Shakib Basma built the first accommodations. The civil war ravaged all that, but things are now in full swing again, and sunbathing on the sand is back on the menu! "
Gola Forest Reserve,"As Sierra Leone&#8217;s last remaining swathe of Upper Guinean Tropical Rainforest, the Gola Reserve commands the attention of nature lovers and conservationists the world over. It&#8217;s been on the international map since the 1920s, and has risen to particular fame thanks to its booming population of resident chimpanzees (the number stands at over 300 individuals in total!). However, the park also displays the rare biodiversity of old-growth woodland, with layer upon layer of organisms residing from the undergrowth to the canopy: colorful butterflies; galumphing forest elephants; pygmy hippos – the list goes on! "
Bo Town,"Officially just Bo, though affectionately and colloquially known as Bo Town, Sierra Leone&#8217;s second city sits deep in the Southern Province. Down-to-earth and industrial by nature, the place is driven by diamond prospecting and mining. However, there are some lively (thanks largely to the student crowds of the Njala University) spots to settle for a drink and a bite to eat, along with some great natural attractions on the edge of the city – not least of all the Kangari Hills Forest Reserve to the north. Bo Town is connected with the capital by a long, paved road, and journeys here from the city on the coast take around four hours from start to finish. "
Outamba Kilimi National Park,"If you&#8217;re eager to keep company with chimpanzees and swinging mangabeys, then there can really be no substitute for the vast reaches of the Outamba Kilimi National Park. They sit in the extreme north of Sierra Leone, unfolding close to the border with the Republic of Guinea in a mosaic of savannah and woodland, groves of goomar teaks and hills that poke just above the canopies. Ecotourism is the main draw, and today thousands of safari comers head here to see hippos in the muddy waters of the Kilimi River, elephants in the forests, bongo antelopes on the ridges, and even chimpanzees overhead! "
Kenema,"Away from the coast and deep in the middle of the Eastern Province, the country&#8217;s third-largest city can be found cascading down the ridges of the Kambui Hills to meet the winding courses of the Moa River. Like many provincial hubs, Kenema has a colourful clock tower and lively medley of locals, who can often be seen purring on scooters over the dusty downtown streets, or roaring on the city&#8217;s duo of Sierra Leone National Premier League soccer sides: the Kamboi Eagles and Gem Stars. The city is also the best gateway to the chimp and colobus monkey-spotted wilds of the South Kambui Hills Forest Reserve. "
Makeni,"Close to the geographical heart of Sierra Leone, the bustling, mercantile and industrial city of Makeni ticks over to the sounds of Krio chatter and cheers for the local Wusum Stars football team. A lived-in place that&#8217;s not really got any standout attractions for the visitor, this provincial hub is a great town for getting a feel of what day to day life is like in this West African nation. And there is an all-new clock tower in the works, lots of infrastructure investment in play, and easy access to the greater region of Bombali – the home of the aforementioned Outamba Kilimi National Park! "
Lungi,"Although best-known for the bustling international airport (the Freetown International Airport) that it hosts, Lungi is actually a magnet for travelers who are eager to be in the action, but don&#8217;t want to bed down right in the midst of frenetic Freetown. Just a short drive north from the capital, the coastal stretch that runs to the south here is actually home to oodles of luxurious resort hotels. And there are sun-kissed beaches too, offering a seemingly endless stretch of golden sand that&#8217;s ripe for beachcombing and people watching. "
Kabala,"At the very heart of one of Sierra Leone&#8217;s fertile breadbasket regions, and set high amidst the breezy tops of the north-eastern hills, the town of Kabala is a welcome break from the sun-scorched, dust-caked places of the country&#8217;s lowlands. It&#8217;s also a pretty spot, peppered with low-rise bungalows and tin-roofed builds, imbued with lively local farmers&#8217; markets and surrounded by bucolic swathes. The main draws lie in the hinterland nearby though, where endless walking trails will take travelers through rural farming communities and up into the forest-dressed peaks of the Northern Province. "
Sherbro Island,"A large shard of land that fragments from Sierra Leone and points straight out into the Atlantic Ocean, Sherbro Island is cut-through by countless river channels and formed from sweeping vistas of wetland and swamp. It&#8217;s a sleepy and rustic place, with just a smattering of small towns like Bonthe and pint-sized San, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Sherbro people – contented, bucolic and curiously westernized fishing types. There&#8217;s a fascinating history to unravel here too &#8211; Sherbro Island went from British bastion of anti-slave trade enforcement to resettlement community for repatriated American slaves. "
Kambui Hills Forest Reserve,"Located just on the edge of the aforementioned backwater town of Kenema, the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve might not be Sierra Leone&#8217;s most famous natural area, but it&#8217;s certainly got charms all of its own. For starters, there&#8217;s the rare birdlife, which ranges from the white-necked rockfowl to the green-tailed bristlebill. That avian biodiversity is mirrored on the ground too, where duikers and forest elephants tread their own paths through the forest. And thanks to the proximity close to a regional city, trips here are relatively easy to organize! "
Bratislava,"The largest city in Slovakia, as well as being the capital, Bratislava lies on the River Danube and borders both Austria and Hungary. Come here for a trip to the imposing Bratislava Castle, perched on a plateau above the city and originally built in the 10th century. The city is located in an area of lush vegetation so there are a wealth of parks, open spaces, and lakes in and around Bratislava, including Rusovce Lake, although if you choose to venture there, be forewarned, it is also famous as an area for nudists!  If you head into Old Town in Bratislava be sure to take a ride around on the tourist train that will give you a whistle-stop tour of the city so that you can take in the history and culture from the comfort of a seat. Bratislava is also known for its eclectic music scene, from underground clubs that feature up and coming experimental artists, to its annual Bratislava Music Festival and jazz festival known as Jazz Days. "
Jasná,"The region of Liptov is considered by many locals and one of the jewels in the crown of Slovakia, and as such it is one of the most visited areas of the country. The largest ski resort in Slovakia, Jasná, is found in the Liptov region, and if you enjoy winter sports then there are a wealth of trails here for all different abilities to try, including both skiing and snowboarding options. If you prefer water to snow then you can visit Aquapark Tatralandia, one of the largest water parks in all of Central Europe, where all the water comes from thermal springs, said to have healing properties. For those interested in the local folklore, a trip to the sleepy village of Vikolínec, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is a must-do, and you will find log houses, a quaint wooden chapel, and a folklore museum. "
Slovak Karst Caves,"Slovakia is home to almost 2,500 caves, and more are being discovered as time goes on, with some 400 having been explored to date. The entire Slovak Karst region of caves has UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and if you like spelunking then you can’t miss a trip to one of the spectacular caves in the region. If you want to see one of only three Aragonite caves in the world then you should head to Ochtinská Aragonite Cave. If you are feeling brave, you can also visit a section of Domica Cave that features boat rides on a river known as the River Styx, the river in Greek mythology that passengers had to cross to reach the Underworld. "
Košice,"The charming city of Košice was named the European Capital of Culture in 2013 and has a cosmopolitan feel to it that expertly mixes the old with the new. Explore the Old Town where you will find medieval architecture and many of the buildings here are protected. For a fine example of Gothic style, head to St Elisabth Cathedral, built in the 14th century, as well as the St Michael Chapel that also dates from the same period. If you like culture then you can spend an afternoon in the East Slovak Gallery that pays tribute to Slovak art, or the East Slovak Museum to learn more about the history of Slovakia. "

In the town square you will find the Old Town Hall which is now a museum for those who want to learn more about the region, as well as the iron cage that still sits in the square with the rather alarming name, ‘The Cage of Shame’ which was used in days gone by to punish criminals. "
Pieštàny,"Known predominantly as a spa town, come to Pieštàny for some rest and relaxation as you bathe in the medicinal thermal waters as well as the sulphuric mud, said to cure a number of ills. The spa is located on the aptly named Spa Island and features a range of treatments and baths that make use of the geothermal properties created by mineral deposits from the surrounding mountains.

Ljubljana,"You might get a feeling that Llubljana is a special place when you wander around this dainty city and notice the myriad dragon statues that dot the streets. According to legend, Jason and the Argonauts slayed a similar monster in Llubljana in the days of old and, aside from the dragons, the city is packed full of gorgeous architecture that dates for the Baroque period.

"
Vogel,"Slovenia is not well known as a skiing destination although it really should be as it even snows in the summer months at higher altitudes. Rising above the impossibly pretty Bohinj Lake you will find Vogel, where you can enjoy either downhill or cross country skiing trails, and there are different sections depending on your ability and fitness levels. One of the best things about Slovenia is the fact that those who enjoy winter sports can indulge their passion from December through to May when crisp, powdery snow is pretty much guaranteed in the country. "
Laško,"If you feel like you might be in need of some rest and relaxation, or simply fancy a dip in a soothing warm bath, then the thermal waters of the town of Laško are not to be missed. The waters are said to have healing and rejuvenating properties and locals and visitors alike have flocked to the area to bathe for centuries. "
Rogatec Open-Air Museum,"If you want a slightly different museum experience then head outside and visit Rogatec Open-Air Museum that is based around a farm. The emphasis of the museum is to teach visitors about the local customs and folk traditions of Slovenia and there are arts and crafts activities and workshops that allow you to try your hand at bread baking, basket weaving, or even blacksmithing. There is also a nearby manor that dates from the Renaissance period that visitors can tour to learn all about Slovenian heritage and traditions from the 18th Century onwards. "
Postojna Cave,"Located just outside the town of Postojna is the Postojna Cave, a karst cave that takes the form of haunting bubbles and frothing rocks thanks to the natural limestone dissolved by the waters of the Pivka River from which the karst topography is created. The systems of caves are the second longest in Slovenia and highlights include a stalagmite named Brilliant which has also become the symbol of the cave. Other things not to miss are the underground railway the transports visitors deep into the bowels of the cave, the Concert Hall (actually a large cave known for its spectacular acoustics), and the Spaghetti Hall, so called because of the shape of the tunnels within. "
Logarska Dolina,"Logarska Dolina is a valley in the Alps that lends itself to gentle rambles through forests that have stood for centuries. The valley actually dates from the Ice Age and sits upon the site of a glacier than created the basin that makes the area resemble a trough. For the brave of heart this area is often used as the base camp for those wishing to scale the mighty peaks of the Kamnik-Savinja Alps. The valley falls into distinct areas, namely the lower, central, and upper parts, and in the lower and central areas visitors will find gorgeous meadows through which to meander. In the upper part of the valley the forests begin in earnest, and the entire area has now become a regional park that ensures that visitors can marvel at the local plant and animal life in a pristine environment of almost untouched natural beauty. "
Predjama Castle,"For a truly awe inspiring experience, head to Predjama Castle. Firstly, this is a feat of engineering like no other as the castle is built in the mouth of a cave atop a cliff that rises to over 120 metres. As if this wasn’t enough, the castle is said to be over 700 years old and was the former home of a Slovenian famous figure named Erazem Lueger, a knight and noble baron turned robber who famously stole from the elite and gave to the poor, also challenging the establishment in Slovenia as a kind of Robin Hood-like figure. Reenactments are often displayed at the castle including medieval jousting held in July. "
Triglav National Park,"Taking its name from Slovenia’s highest peak, Triglav, this is the only national park in the country and is found in the north-western region of the Julian Alps. The park is protected from extensive building work in order to preserve the natural beauty of the area, and the glacial Triglav Lakes as well as Mount Triglav are the bid draws here for visitors. "
Soca Valley,"Soca River that runs through the valley of the same name has to be seen to be believed, as it is actually a stunning shade of brilliant turquoise. The valley is spectacular in its own right and features a wide range of local flora and fauna for visitors to explore, but if you want to do something more adventurous then there are a plethora of outdoor activities available in this natural playground. Rafting on the river is popular and a great way to take in the views as you sail by on the water or you can take to the skies with other extreme pursuits like paragliding. If you want something a little calmer, then you can ride horses along mountain trails, or hike in the surrounding areas and stop at one of the many picturesque spots in the valley for a picnic. Cycling and mountain biking are also becoming more and more popular in Slovenia is you fancy tackling the mountain terrain. "
Maribor,"Having won the prestigious title of European Capital of Culture 2012, come to Maribor, Slovenia’s second largest city, to learn all about the local culture and in particular the wine. The city is famed for having some of the oldest vines in the world and for the superb wine that they create, and there are vineyards that stretch from the town of Maribor into the Pohorje forests. As you would expect there is also a Festival of Wine held annually, and Maribor is perfect for wine lovers looking to see how wine is made from vine to table. "
Vršic Pass,"Rising to over 1,500 meters, the Vršic Pass is famed as the highest mountain pass in the Julian Alps in Slovenia and has a road that stretches all the way along the pass before dipping down to the Soca Valley named Russian Road that dates from the early twentieth century. The pass is well known as an ideal place for climbers who want to tackle one of the peaks in the surrounding areas, some of which rise to over 7,000 feet, as well as with hikers looking for shorter excursions. If you want to stay in the area then there are a range of charming mountain lodges to choose from that will allow you to soak in the local culture. "
Piran,"Slovenia lies on the Adriatic Sea, and the town of Piran is one coastal attraction that you don’t want to miss. The town features Venetian architecture and has winding cobbled streets that allow you to explore on foot at a leisurely pace as you breathe in the salty air. You can also visit St George’s Church that dominates the skyline of the diminutive town from its vantage point on a hill and, should you make it up there, you can enjoy uninterrupted views all the way to the sea. "
Blejski Vintgar,"Known as one of the most popular attractions in Slovenia with locals, the Vintgar Gorge sits outside of the city of Bled near the village of Podhom. The gorge is neatly bisected by the Radovna River, and there are bridges, paths, and viewing galleries that run the length of the area so that visitors can take in the spectacular views in a number of ways and explore the gorge to its full potential. "
Hargeisa,"Ask anyone in Hargeisa and they&#8217;ll tell you that the city isn&#8217;t a part of Somalia at all, but rather the self-proclaimed capital of Somaliland – a break-away state that&#8217;s been governing on its own, without the sanction of Somalia&#8217;s federal government or the United Nations, since 1991. And while the political machine that&#8217;s housed in the mansions of Hargeisa officially doesn&#8217;t exist – at least in the eyes of outsiders – there&#8217;s plenty to be said for this onetime vassal of British East Africa. For starters, the place is relatively peaceful and non-violent. There are honorific monuments to the great struggles with Siad Barre&#8217;s totalitarian rule in the 90s, and signs of law and order not found elsewhere in the country: traffic lights; police; even the occasional tourist! "
Laas Geel,"Leading us neatly on from our last hotspot, the Laas Geel reside between the dusty ridges and hills just on the outskirts of the Somaliland capital, Hargeisa. Home to some of the earliest cave paintings ever discovered on the Horn of Africa, the various alcoves and underground tunnels here display a raw and haunting vision of prehistory in these parts. You&#8217;ll be able to make out colourful motifs of cattle, artistic renditions of shepherds tending to their flocks, and even what&#8217;s thought to be deified cows! The best thing though? The Laas Geel is hardly developed at all, leaving visitors alone with history. "
Ruins of the Adal Sultanate in modern Zeila,"Carrying on the Somaliland (as opposed to Somalia) theme, the town of Zeila (also known as Seylac) beckons adventurous travelers to the far-flung north-western corner of the nation, where the dry and arid land of sand dunes and rocky hills crashes into the pearly blue of the Aden Gulf. Sat just a stone&#8217;s throw from the Djiboutian border, the spot can only really be accessed by 4X4. Once in, visitors are treated to a mosaic of ruined Muslim palaces and aged colonial facades, standing like dust-caked spectres of a bygone era. Others will head to the gorgeous Zeila Coast, where rusting ship carcasses pepper the shore and the rollers of the Indian Ocean spray whitewash into the air. "
Sa&#8217;ad ad-Din Island,"The first half of the fabled Zeila Archipelago to make this list is also the most visited of the six islets that lurk just a stone&#8217;s throw from the coast of Somaliland off the ancient city of Zeila. Having only recently become one of the country&#8217;s rare national parks, this one&#8217;s got everything from sparkling coral reefs to bays of turquoise water, ivory-coloured beaches to craggy peaks of sandstone rock. You can expect to see kaleidoscopic schools of fish under the water, where the exotic creatures of the Red Sea mix with the larger animals of the Indian Ocean to create a real show of marine life. "
Berbera,"Once trodden by Ottoman imperialists, and having reigned as a focal point for traders from right across the Indian Ocean basin – from as close as Arabia and as far afield as Mumbai and Goa – the city of Berbera is closely linked to its mercantile past. It&#8217;s a history that was made possible by the presence of one of the few deep-water ocean ports on this section of the African Horn, and today, the city is still known as the major harbor in the area. Locals will champion Berbera&#8217;s gorgeous desert-like backcountry, along with the sun-kissed beaches of Batalale and Bathela that fringe the Gulf of Aden close to the town. "
Iskushuban,"One of the major attractions in the autonomous region of Puntland in the northern reaches of Somalia, the ancient settlement of Iskushuban has crenulated walls of dust-caked stone and beautiful arabesque fortifications from centuries gone by. It&#8217;s thought that the spot was one of the main powerbases of the Majeerteenia Sultinate that ruled the very tip of the African Horn for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, history aside, most people come here to see the waterfalls, which gush when in season and hail in as the second largest in the country! "
Lag Badana-Bushbush National Park,"A land of waxy palm trees and golden sands, where the slow wash of the Indian Ocean kisses the shore and stilted bungalows of bamboo shoulder their way into the coconut groves, you might think that the Lag Badana-Bushbush National Park is a veritable paradise. And, actually, it is. Or at least it would be, were it not for the brutal conflicts that have engulfed the southern regions of Somalia where the reserve makes its home. These have gone from the civil war of the nineties and noughties to encounters with extremists today. When they end, perhaps this wonderful land of tropical beauties will be on the menu once again. "
Mogadishu,"There&#8217;s no avoiding this tricky subject: Mogadishu is a city of warlords and marauding gangs (usually all rumbling over the pot-holed roads with a forest of AK-47 barrels rumbling with them!). In fact, there&#8217;s barely been a safe moment in Somalia&#8217;s capital since the tenuous end of the civil war, which raged in various forms here until 2012. However, there are some signs that things are beginning to change. Turkish investment in the Aden Adde International Airport have seen huge renovations, there are now flight routes to Istanbul and Dubai, and there&#8217;s always going to be potential in throbbing Bakaara Market, and that gorgeous Mogadishu Old Town, cascading down to the Indian Ocean in a dash of crenulated Italianesque mansions. "
Lamadaya,"Lamadaya is really only home to one attraction and one attraction only: waterfalls. The largest in the nation, they cascade over the sheer-cut cliffs of the Cal Madow ranges, which line-up against the Gulf of Aden and cross Puntland, Somaliland and the northern fringes of the country. Breathtaking to say the least, these natural wonders have carved their way through the ochre-hued rock of the earth, made deep plunge pools at their bottom, and crafted curious mineral formations beneath their flow. "
Bosaso,"The energy and action of Bosaso emanates directly from the huge seaport that fringes its coastal reaches. The main and largest harbor in all of Somalia, this city of 700,000 has boomed considerably in the years following the end of the civil war. Industry and enterprise have taken over, there are new schools and infrastructure investment, and Dubai funds have recently plumbed millions of dollars into the local airport too. And then there are the sandy beaches that line the shore to the east and west of town, the rugged peaks of the Cal Madow that beckon hikers to the horizon, and the local ostrich farms in the desert – see, there&#8217;s plenty to do! "
Xaafuun,"The Xaafuun of today is just a shadow of what it once was. Put simply: the history here is grand and immersive. Just to give you an idea, fragments of Mycenaean pottery from the Heroic Age of ancient Greece have been discovered in the dusty nooks and crevices of this town, while relics of the Majeerteen Sultanate pepper its headland by the multitude. In more recent years, the place has taken on an industrial veneer, with fishing conglomerates and Italian mining multinationals replacing the onetime spice depots with a less-than-attractive sprawl. Xaafuun really is a place to wallow in the more illustrious past. "
Garoowe,"Garoowe is the municipal center of the autonomous state of Puntland, which claims hegemony over the northern reaches of Somalia and the tip of the African Horn. Developing fast, the town has sprouted new libraries and paved roads, NGO offices and even hospitals in recent years. Historically, it was one of the urban centers that formed the Majeerteen Sultanate, before coming under the control of Italian Somalia in colonial times. Few of the old relics remains, and Garoowe is now a town looking firmly towards the future. "
Bardera,"Although now encased in the war-torn southern region of Somalia, there was a time when green Bardera figured as one of the nation&#8217;s agricultural kingpins. Set in the gorgeous Jubba Valley that cuts right through the heart of this part of East Africa, it&#8217;s encompassed by countless farming communities that produce leather and dairy and more. Also before the start of the sectarian violence here, people would come to see the pretty steel Dutch bridge and the winding courses of the Webi Jubba River. "
"<br />Bath, Somerset","If the Romans discovered Bath it was the Georgians who perfected it when they turned this city into the luxury resort of choice in the 1700s. Yet for all the magnificent architecture from this time the prime attraction in Bath is the Roman bathing complex established some 1,800 years before. The Roman Baths are one of the things people travel to England to see, and for a Roman site the level of preservation is rare in Britain and helped by Victorian reconstructions. The museum at the complex is a treasure chest of wonderful artefacts. The second period of glory came in the 18th century when the resplendent Royal Crescent was just one of many grand designs. Jane Austen set Northanger Abbey and parts of Persuasion in Bath after visiting at the turn of the 19th century. "
Wells Cathedral,"England&#8217;s smallest city may also be one of its loveliest, as Wells has some major sights for a place with just 10,000 residents. The undoubted pinnacle is Wells Cathedral, a building of unrivalled historical significance and beauty. Work began in the 12th century, and unlike other churches from the same period Wells Cathedral has no traces of Norman romanesque design, so is the first completely gothic building, not just in England but possibly the world. All of the cathedral&#8217;s ecclesiastical buildings survive, so you can see the imperious 13th-century Bishop&#8217;s Palace and the historic Vicar&#8217;s Close, remarkable for being a planned residential street unaltered since the 1300s. "
"Exmoor, Somerset","Most of Exmoor National Park is inside Somerset&#8217;s lines, and makes up a great deal of the western part of the county. In the north the hills arrive at the Bristol Channel in dramatic fashion, forming the highest sea cliffs in the country, brutal dark sandstone walls. The interior is tall hills clad with heather plunging to sheltered valleys that harbour ancient woodland. There are little medieval villages and hamlets with pubs, and between these are huge uninhabited spaces, where sheep and semi-wild Exmoor ponies graze on hillsides and large red deer are a common sight. "
"Grand Pier, Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset","On the Bristol Channel, Weston-super-Mare is an archetypal Victorian seaside resort. Its virtues now are the same as they were more than 100 years ago: There&#8217;s the sea, a gigantic beach that goes out for miles at low tide and two old piers, one of which (the Grand Pier) has just been refurbished after a fire in 2008. Sunny summer days are when Weston-super-Mare&#8217;s allure will be most obvious, and littler tourists will be pleased with the amusements, donkey rides and the timeless fun of building sandcastles on the beach. At other times it&#8217;s good for an invigorating dose of sea air and to see the Victorian architecture, composed of a creamy limestone quarried at the village of Uphill close by. "
Glastonbury Tor,"For 51 weeks of the year Glastonbury is a likeable old village with some exceptional history close by. Glastonbury Tor is a monumental sandstone hill with the 15th-century St Michael&#8217;s Tower at its crest, which is the last vestige of a long ruined church. Glastonbury Abbey is rooted in the 7th century and was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. And as for the final abbot, well he was hanged, drawn and quartered on Glastonbury Tor in 1539. On the lighter side, that other week of the year is in June when one of the world&#8217;s essential performing arts events unfolds at the dairy farm of Michael Eavis. "
Cheddar Gorge,"On the southern side of the Mendip Hills, Cheddar is a village amid strawberry fields with one of Britain&#8217;s natural wonders in its backyard. The Cheddar Gorge is the largest in the country, descending almost 140 metres at its deepest points. The limestone is riddled with caves and ancient quarries that you can visit, and it was here that Britain&#8217;s oldest complete human skeleton was found, dating back 9,000 years. We&#8217;ve come this far without mentioning cheddar cheese, which originates in this village and is traditionally stored in the caves to mature. The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company is a must, and sells the only cheddar still made in Cheddar! "
"Catherine Hill, Frome","Exploring the historic streets of Frome can be pretty addictive: There are more than 500 listed buildings in the town, some as old as the 15th century. Catherine Hill should be the first place on your itinerary, a steep hill that winds up from the old centre, with locally-owned shops and cafes on each side, all set in lovely stone buildings. In the 17th-century wool and cloth were the local business, and there are several streets of cottages built for mill-workers in the Trinity area, which is some of England&#8217;s oldest industrial housing. Ten minutes southwest of Frome are the striking ruins of Nunney Castle, damaged and abandoned during the English Civil War but with an exciting amount of detail still intact and still encircled by a moat. "
"Bridgwater, Somerset","Bestriding the River Parrett, about ten miles from where this tidal river enters the Bristol Channel, Bridgwater&#8217;s location has made it a hotspot for manufacturing and trade for hundreds of years. Bridgwater was the birthplace of General at Sea Robert Blake in 1598, considered one of the country&#8217;s most distinguished military commanders. The house he was born in is a museum for his career, and also paints a picture of everyday life in the this town around the 16th and 17th centuries. See the sights in the centre, like the 13th-century Church of St Mary, and the 18th-century Corn Exchange, which has an unusual circular portico. "
"Somerton, Somerset","This was the county town for little while in the 1300s, and may also have been the capital of the Kingdom of Wessex in the 10th century. Now it&#8217;s a town of less than 5,000, but you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find a more charming place for a quiet rural getaway. Nearly all the old architecture in Somerton is built with blue lias stone, which has a lovely rustic quality. There are 17th century almshouses to track down, and the Church of St Michael has a roof with cider barrels and dragons carved into it, supposedly by the monks of Muchelney Abbey in medieval times. Made of the same blue lias is Lytes Cary, a breathtaking manor house with parts as old as the 1300s. "
"Taunton, Somerset","As with many places in Somerset, Taunton was vital to the Saxons, who erected a fortress here in the 8th century where the present Taunton Castle stands. This particular landmark has Norman origins, but was transformed in the 1700s, and the Great Hall now houses the Museum of Somerset. There are some spellbinding bits of Somerset&#8217;s history, like an outstanding Roman mosaic from the Low Ham Villa and the Froome Hoard, consisting of more than 52,500 coins from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Plan an afternoon at Hestercombe House, which has the most sublime gardens in the French style, with a parterre and pergolas. "
Montacute House,"Begin with the village in Montacute, which is entirely composed of the local hamstone, a kind of limestone with a rich yellowy-grey tone. For many centuries this stone has been quarried at Ham Hill, which peaks at 125 metres and once had an Iron Age fort at its crest. Soaring west of Montacute is St Michael&#8217;s Hill, with earthworks created by ancient wine terraces and a romantic 18th-century folly of a castle tower at the top. The Elizabethan Montacute House is also made from hamstone and was one of the first stately homes to come under the care of the National Trust. Inside this splendid renaissance palace are period furniture and tapestries, as well as Tudor and Jacobean portraits hanging in the majestic setting of the 52-metre Long Gallery. "
Minehead Beach,"On the Bristol Channel and also at the northeastern cusp of Exmoor, Minehead is a seaside town with an unassuming character. In the late-1800s industrialists from places like Bristol erected grand properties on the waterfront and on North Hill, one of Exmoor&#8217;s last outcrops that climbs sharply on the west side of the town. When the sun is out in summer Minehead starts to fill up with day-trippers who come for the sandy beach and shallow waters as the slope is so gentle. Kids and nostalgic grown-ups will be keen on a steam train ride on the West Somerset Railway, running along the fringes of Exmoor and the idyllic Quantock Hills down to Bishops Lydeard. "
"Langport, Somerset","This ancient market town also has Saxon origins and boasts two historic centres; one by the bucolic River Parrett for trade and another on the hilltop for defence, and where the solemn 15th-century Church of All Saints now sits. The elongated layout lends what is quite small town a lot of period properties, most from the 18th and 19th centuries. Langport is also right on the Somerset Levels, a vast tract of central Somerset with a low elevation, home to wetlands, moors, meadows and farms. Flooding can be common in winter, but in summer you can stride off into the lush scenery via the Parrett River Trail and onto the scenic North Moor. "
Wincanton,"Coming into the town of Wincanton in east of Somerset you may recognise something amiss on the signs. Wincanton is officially twinned with Ankh-Morpork, a fictional city fromTerry Pratchett&#8217;s Discworld novels. Fans can pick up Discworld memorabilia at the Discworld Emporium, while Pratchett and illustrator Richard Kingston used to drink at the Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin pub. On the old buildings in Wincanton you may find a lot of references to horses, and these date to when the town was a staging post on the main road to London. If horseracing suits your fancy, Wincanton Racecourse is a National Hunt (hurdle) venue with races running through the winter months. "
"St. Mary&#8217;s, Ilminster","Another of Somerset&#8217;s ancient market towns, Ilminster&#8217;s history goes back at least as far as the 8th century. It has had a charter for a weekly market since the 11th century, which still trades to this day. Ilminster&#8217;s older buildings are made from that gorgeous yellowy hamstone, and this goes for the Church of St Mary (The Minster), an exquisite 15th-century gothic building containing the tombs of the noble Wadham family. You&#8217;re truly in cider country in Ilminster, so you shouldn&#8217;t pass up a tour of the Perry&#8217;s Cider Mill, and Barrington Court is a fabulous Elizabethan stately home with an arts and crafts-style garden complete with apple orchards. "
"Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa","The capital of Free State and one of South Africa’s three national capitals, Bloemfontein is sometimes called “the city of the roses” thanks to the rose festival held here each year.  But it’s more than just beautiful to look at; the city has a plethora of cultural, historical, and natural attractions. For a start, try the Oliewenhuis Art Museum, the National Museum, the Free State National Botanical Garden, Vodacom Parkland the Anglo Boer War Museum.  For round two, try the digital planetarium, the music scene at die Mystic Boer, and then go fishing at Maselspoort. The lists are endless so plan to stay at least a couple days. "
Cape Town,"The Mother City is a microcosm for the country’s diversity.  All major religions peacefully coexist here and provide wonderful religious and cultural influences – despite South Africa’s difficult history.  This is where you’ll find the iconic Table Mountain, the spectacular flat topped mountain.  There are also nature trails, water sports, fine dining, unbelievable wine estate, and golden beaches. Be sure to head to the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens as well as Green Point Park.  If you like an adventure, try abseiling off Table Mountain or tandem-paragliding off Lion’s Head. Cape Town was designated a World Design Capital in 2014 and is full of street art and amazing architecture.  End your visit with a trip to one of the historic farms in Constantia for a relaxing wine tasting. "
Durban,"Durban is one of South Africa’s most popular holiday destinations because of its year round near perfect weather.  If you want to stay outside, check out the gondola rides, fishing, uShaka Marine World, Gateway Theatre, and every water sport you can imagine.  When you want a break from the sun, head downtown and discover the wonderful art deco facades and explore the more urban parts of town.  The city feels decidedly Asian, and has a large Indian community.  Stroll through the markets and you’ll wonder if you’re still in South Africa. "
"Comaro Street, Johannesburg","Jo’burg has it all:  fine dining, intoxicating nightlife, headline entertainment, arts, couture shopping, and the Gautrain. This rapidly changing city has a tough history with nearly 20 years of decline.  But the economy has seen an influx of business and tourism lately.  In Newtown and Braamfontein, the two cultural districts, you’ll find the restaurants, cafes, museums, and theatres.  There is so much energy here, it’s infectious.  The Inner City is quickly becoming a tourist hot spot.  You’ll want to make a stop at Maboneng, a hipster type neighbourhood on the eastern side of the Inner City. It’s a city still struggling with its history, but Johannesburg isn’t pretentious and has a lot to offer.  Don’t forget to make a stop at the Apartheid Museum for a sobering reminding of the countries past. "
"Nahoon River, East London","If you want a laid back beach scene that doesn’t have the crowds, East London is perfect for you.  You’ve got everything you want in a beach, warm ocean, water sports, outdoor adventure, and plenty of sunshine. The heart of the city is an industrial town, and its neighbours generally have more attractions and excursions, if you’re looking for perfect beaches and a chance to escape, you’ll love the bay front location and the huge sand hills. "
Pietermaritzburg,This heritage city is located in the forests and rolling pastures of the Natal Midlands.  It’s considered one of the best preserved Victorian cities on Earth.  A tour through town to look at the historic buildings will take you back to another age. Many of these grand buildings have been converted into museums.  The city is made up of a large student population as well as a Zulu community which brings a lot of colour to the place.  Pietermaritzburg makes the perfect base camp for exploring both the Midlands Meander and Kwa Zulu-Natal. 
Kimberley,"Another historic city is Kimberley, also known as “the city that sparkles.” Located in the heart of the Diamond Fields region, it’s the home of De Beers and has a rich mining past.  The city has capitalized on its history and there are many areas where you feel like you’re in the Old West.  Have a drink in an old timey saloon, enjoy a ghost tour to learn about the miners of the past, or take a look at the world’s largest hand dug hole. There’s a lot of history to discover here so be sure to put some of their many museums on your list. "
Pretoria,"“Jacaranda City” is swimming in a sea of purple Jacaranda trees.  A similar city to Johannesburg, but much more laid back, Pretoria has great museums, historical buildings, and natural attractions for your enjoyment.  Once the heart of apartheid South Africa a new energy is infusing the city and foreign embassies, businesses, and tourism reach Pretoria. When you want a relaxing stopover as you travel the country, Pretoria is definitely worth a visit. "
Port Elizabeth,"Most South African cities seem to have a nickname, and Port Elizabeth’s is the “Friendly City.” At the end of the Garden Route, it lies along Algoa Bay at the western end of the Sunshine Coast.  You’ll find blue-flag beaches, water sports, and a surprising amount of history here.  Port Elizabeth, along with the satellite towns of Despatch and Uitenhage, are collectively known as Nelson Mandela Bay.  Head to the suburban centres for some up-market shopping, bars, and restaurants. "
Soweto,"Some say the real South Africa can be found in townships like Soweto. Famous for the part it played in the apartheid struggle, you can discover many historically significant sites here.  There are official township tours and these are a great way to explore. The tours include places like Walter Sisulu Square where South Africa’s Freedom Charter was signed in 1955, or the Hector Pieterson Memorial, where the 1976 uprising began.  There’s also Vilakazi Street, once home to Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. For some fun, take a look at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.  It’s listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest hospital in the world. "
Knysna,"Part of the famous Garden Route, Knysna is famous for the oyster festival and incredible views that stretch from Leisure Isle all the way to the Knysna Heads.  The Heads are a difficult passage in the water – many vessels have been shipwrecked here. Check out the Featherbed Nature Reserve as well as the incredible Knysna Elephant Park and Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary. Dolphin sightings are pretty regular in Knysna and there are several dolphin spotting boat trips that include a stop at Plettenberg Bay or Robberg Peninsula to see the noisy seal colonies. For those looking for a little bit of relaxing, combined with a little bit of adventure, this is your place. "
Oudtshoorn,"Welcome to the ostrich capital of the world.  Oudtshoorn is located between the Swartberg and Outeniqua mountains and is ideal for outdoor and nature lovers.  You have to travel through Klein Karoo to get there; a beautiful semi-desert area. The mountain range has been declared a Cape Floral World Heritage Site and you’ll see some stunning vistas as you explore the area.   Nearby are the Cango Caves and the historical village of De Rust. If you’re in the mood for a road trip, consider crossing the Swartberg Pass or driving down the 25km Meiringspoort. If you’re there around Easter time, don’t miss the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees – the largest language arts festival in the country. "

The Murray River is the third longest navigable river in the world, next to the Amazon and Nile, and a popular way to explore the river is by houseboat. The Murray River spans three states (New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia), finally entering the Southern Ocean in the area of Coorong, South Australia.

Hells Hole is another sinkhole, but much larger, deeper, and full of fresh blue water. Diving into Hells Hole is allowed with a permit. "
Farina,"Farina is an uninhabited ghost town, and it’s a fascinatingly eerie site! This once-thriving township reached its peak population of 600 in the late 1800s: at the time, it had an underground bakery, two hotels, five blacksmiths, a general store, two breweries, a school, a church and a brothel. It was once a major trucking yard for sheep and cattle, and there were also several mines in the region. When the railway line was moved away from Farina, the town’s population began moving elsewhere, leaving the town to crumble into ruins; but in recent years, volunteers with the Restoration Farina group have begun to restore the town; funds for the project come from the restored underground Farina Bakery, which is sporadically open for business. In the future, Restoration Farina hopes to open a museum in the town; in the meanwhile, the interesting ruins make it well worth the trip! "
Coober Pedy,"Coober Pedy is a mining town specializing in gorgeous opals, but there’s plenty more to see in this popular tourist site: it’s perhaps best-known for the underground homes that many of the residents live in. The town experiences freezing nights in winter, and extremely hot days in summer, so many of the residents live in “dugouts”, in caves carved out of hillsides. They’re a lot more comfortable than they sound, though: Faye’s Underground Home is a gorgeous example, and it’s open to visitors; it even has a swimming pool in the living room! There’s also two dugout churches &#8211; the Serbian Orthodox and the Catacomb – and you can even stay in an underground hotel, or eat and drink at an underground restaurant or bar!

The Painted Desert,"150kms north of Coober Pedy, the Painted Desert is the barren outback at its most beautiful: awash with soft, fragile and colorful rock formations. 80 million years ago, this area was a seabed, and a combination of rain, weather and erosion has left masses of orange, yellow and white shale on the sloping hills, giving the area its apt name. The desert is particularly beautiful at sunrise or sunset, and it’s a great spot to get a charming taste of Australia’s beautiful desert landscapes. "

Lake Eyre,"Lake Eyre is an oasis in the barren Aussie outback, covering 1 million square km and crossing the borders of three states: SA, NT and QLD. Technically two lakes connected by a channel, it’s the largest salt lake in the country, albeit not often filled with water: it has only been filled to capacity thrice in the last 160 years. When the lake starts to dry up and the water evaporates, it appears to turn pink, and when it has dried up completely, the remaining snow-white salt crystals are a stunning sight to behold in of themselves. "
Fleurieu Peninsula,"Just under an hour south of Adelaide, Fleurieu is known as Adelaide’s playground: known for its wineries, water sports, and picturesque scenery, it’s a fun spot either for a day trip or to stay a few days.

Morris Island Lighthouse is one of the few landmarks on Morris Island, standing at the south side of Charleston Harbor. Over the years land erosion has reduced the size of the island, so time may well be running out to appreciate its rugged unspoiled beauty. The Thriller Charleston high speed boat trip is an exciting journey that travels close to Morris Island. "
"Lee Falls, South Carolina","The stunning Lee Falls is one of the highest waterfalls in the South, standing at 75-feet. The waterfall can be found close to Walhalla in Oconee County, but hikers will have to navigate a natural trail, with the walk likely to take between one and two hours to complete. The trek is usually accessible between March and October depending on the weather and the trip is well worth it as Lee Falls is definitely one of the most beautiful locations in South Carolina. "
Rainbow Falls,"Even bigger than Lee Falls is Rainbow Falls, an incredible 140-foot drop into Cox Camp Creek. The trail to the falls is around 4.3 miles long and it is difficult, so only experienced hikers should take it on. The waterfall is technically Camp Greenville property and those wanting to experience it must register at the camp offices before setting off on their trip. Part of the trail involves crossing a creek via a large fallen tree, so this is not for the faint-hearted. "

Beach volleyball, golf and tennis are all popular in this sports-minded community too. "
Caesars Head State Park,"Caesars Head State Park is so named due to the eponymous awesome rock formation that dominates the park, but the two-mile Raven Cliff Falls trail is arguably the star attraction.

Everything you’ll see has been carefully preserved and curated to keep the glory of the old west alive.  There is a great deal of Victorian architecture in Deadwood – which is a little out of place for a late 19th century gold mining town.  But even so, it’s a big part of what makes the town so unique.  You’ll find over 80 gaming halls which have helped to fund the complete restoration of the town.  If you’re lucky, you’ll catch an historical re-enactment.

It’s been built around tourism with plenty of souvenirs to buy and fun to try.  The main strip of New Keystone is about a mile long and features boutiques, restaurant, and family centred activities.  Old Keystone is the original gold mining settlement along the Battle Creek River.  Both are worth a visit.  Many American’s love to camp at Keystone and there’s a well-established camping and RV community there.  Mount Rushmore itself features four beloved American Presidents and a tour guide here is well worth the price – the history is intriguing.  Recently, the Nicholas Cage movie “National Treasure: Book of Secrets” was filmed there. "
"Wall, South Dakota","Wall isn’t a name that sparks the imagination. In the middle of the Badlands you’ll find this small town and it’s 800 members.  It’s a great place to use as a basecamp because it’s just a couple of hours from several of South Dakota’s most famous landmarks.  So you’re an easy drive to places like Mount Rushmore, Custer State Park, the Badlands National Park, and the Black Hills, but away from the crowds in the evenings.  There are great B&amp;B’s, hiking, and biking trails, and cosy restaurants with great food.

"
"Dell Rapids, South Dakota","There is a vein of red quartzite that runs from the Wisconsin Dells all the way to the eastern part of South Dakota.  The vein is over 2,500 feet deep and hundreds of miles long.  It’s also what gives Dell Rapids its identity.  The unique features of the quartzite inspired the town founders to create some pretty interesting architecture.  Close by to the larger Sioux Falls, the historic downtown dates back to the 19th century.  Visit the restored Dells Theatre, the Dell Rapid Museum, and the quilt store – a place that visitors don’t soon forget thanks to the incredible craftsmanship on display.  If you can, catch a local high school football or basketball game and cheer on the Dell Rapids “Quarriors.” "

It has an agricultural history and strong Midwestern values.  Enjoy antique shopping, quaint boutiques, and a great choice of family home-style restaurants.  Follow history’s great march across the country on the Lewis and Clark Trail, visit the Cecil and Phyllis Melcher Museum, and take in a show at the wonderfully restored historic theatre. "
"Aberdeen, South Dakota","If Aberdeen where a person, it would be the talented and practically perfect older sibling that shines above the rest.  It’s a town that wins award after award, year after year.  Everything from service, education, public facilities and activities, and a thriving economy gets accolades in Aberdeen.  It’s also one of the larger towns on this list, but at 27,000, the town is still smaller than most US universities. A favourite stop for tourists in the Dacotah Prairie Museum.  The museum itself is about 70 years old and is create solely from the donations of South Dakotans. "
"Madison, South Dakota","Madison’s motto is ‘Discover the Unexpected.’  And they hit the nail on the head.  They’ve got hiking, lakes, and state parks, and the scenery is largely unspoiled and the crowds are always low. In the winter try snowmobiling, hunting, or ice fishing.  In warm months, walk through downtown and stop in the local cafes for coffee and pie. Kids especially love the Prairie Village Living Museum.  If you’re looking for a romantic getaway, consider spending your time in the John Green Art Studio, boutique shopping, a hike to Walker’s Point, a stay in a rustic cabin, and an evening of fine dining at the resort restaurant. "
"South Dakota State Capitol Building, Pierre","The capital of South Dakota is Pierre, and believe it or not, it’s a small town of only 14,000 residents.  There is no major interstate through the town – despite its being a capital city.  In fact, Pierre was the first permanent settlement in the Dakota region and was first explored by the US government when Lewis and Clark took their epic trek across the country. Today there’s a wonderful trail that retraces some of their steps.  There’s also a great deal of American Indian and early settlers’ history here. Don’t miss the Fort Pierre Chouteau site.  It was once the largest trading post for settlers and American Indians in the Great Plains. Today you can enjoy outdoor adventure like kayaking on the Missouri River and boating on Lake Sharpe or Lake Oahe. "

The first thing you will notice about Brindisi is its amazing port &#8211; the two pronged body of water contains a myriad of shipping vessels and some fantastic scenery. Secondly, if you travel to the northern part of the city you will reach the Isola Sant&#8217;Andrea &#8211; this small island sits at the opening of the harbour and contains a brilliant castle and fantastic views out to the sea. Brindisi also features a range of superb historical structures such as the Monument to Italian Sailors and Brindisi Cathedral. "
Barletta,"Further up the eastern coast of Italy you can find the city of <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-barletta-italy/"">Barletta</a>. This port is a great place to relax and enjoy the beaches and fine Adriatic climate, but also has a host of interesting sites and attractions. The main point of interest is the immense Castello Svevo &#8211; this castle was constructed during the Norman period and has a fantastic design and impressive battlements. If you enjoy walking, the Lungomare Pietro Mennea and the Lido provide opportunities to stretch your legs and take in the sea breeze. This area of Barletta is well maintained and geared for tourists and those wishing to enjoy a day at the beach. Barletta also has several interesting museums and lies in close proximity to Andria and Trani which are two other wonderful destinations. "
Foggia,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-foggia-italy/"">Foggia</a> is a city and commune located in close proximity to the Parco Nazionale del Gargano. This commune has been known as the granary of Italy and is surrounded by fertile farmland &#8211; it also serves as an important transport hub in this region of Italy. Foggia has a fantastic array of attractions and one of the most famous is its cathedral; this Baroque structure has a sublime design and features some stunning architecture. The Piazza Umberto Giordano sits close to the cathedral and has some great shopping opportunities and is surrounded by beautiful buildings. Aside from the architecture, Foggia also has some magnificent parks such as the Parco Karol Wojtyla and the Parco San Felice. For something different and off the beaten track, Foggia is certainly a top pick. "
Capri,"Capri is a small island off the western coast of Southern Italy that lies in close proximity to the Amalfi Coast and Naples. This island is truly beautiful and is a hugely popular destination for day trips. When you step off of the boat you will be astounded at the fantastic scenery of this mesmerizing place. Take the funicular to the Piazzetta and perhaps site and enjoy a drink and people watch. If you prefer to stay active, take a boat trip around the island or explore the fantastic Blue Grotto cave network. Continuing the theme of adventure, you can hike to Monte Solaro for possibly the best views of the whole of Capri. Finally, the nightlife in Capri is vibrant and if you enjoy partying, consider stopping here until the early hours of the morning! "
Catania,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-catania-italy/"">Catania</a> is the second largest city on the island of Sicily and can be found on it&#8217;s eastern coast. Combined with the surrounding communes and towns, this metropolis is actually the 7th largest in Italy. Within the confines of this busy city, you can find a range of historical sites and interesting attractions. Ursino Castle and the Cathedral of Catania are both beautiful structures that have stood the test of time and provide insight into the history of the city. Alternatively, if you want to travel further afield, you can see the immense Mount Etna which is active &#8211; trips are possible to see the smouldering crater and look down on the island of Sicily from up high. "
Ischia,"This island is much larger than Capri which and both sit at either end of the Gulf of Naples. Ischia is a volcanic island and contains a range of mountains and rocky terrain. One of the main sites of this island is the impressive Aragonese Castle that sits proudly on its own small island and is connected by a long footbridge over the sea. Ischia also contains some beautiful villages, an active port and some divine natural gardens. Finally, the island is also home to a selection of beautiful beaches and hidden bays that are a great place to relax and enjoy the Mediterranean sun. "
Parco Nazionale Del Gargano,"On the eastern Adriatic coast of Southern Italy there lies an immense national park &#8211; Gargano. This park covers over 110,000 hectares and is renowned for its beautiful scenery and dramatic coastlines. Throughout this region you can find a multitude of hiking trails, mountains, lakes and stretches of rocky cost and cliffs. "
Aerial view of Messina,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-messina-italy/"">Messina</a> is one of the most important cities on the Island of Sicily and has an extensive history as a major port in the Mediterranean. This city is only a short distance across the Straight of Messina to mainland Italy and has regular boats that travel to Reggio Calabria and Villa San Giovanni. In the city itself there is a magnificent cathedral and bell tower that sit in a picturesque piazza. Furthermore, the Messina Regional Museum contains a myriad of interesting artefacts and displays about the history of the area including archaeological excavations and artwork from Caravaggio. In the immediate area, there is also several coastal towns such as Torre Faro that have beaches and a host of restaurants and beach bars. "
Boma National Park,"Environmentalists and naturalists have been arguing for years over weather Boma National Park is the home of the largest or the second-largest annual land mammal migration on the planet. Some say it&#8217;s the Serengeti and the movement of the countless wildebeest there, others – most notably the South Sudanese themselves! – claim the honor for this vast swathe of wilderness that clings to the edge of the Ethiopian border in the east. But whether you come to see the great peregrinations of the white-eared kob or not, you can rest assured the park will be one to remember. Zebras and gazelles, oryx, cheetah and gliding vultures are all visible, hiding amidst the rolling savannah and occasional bluffs of rock. "
Wau,"It&#8217;s precisely because of Wau&#8217;s place at the confluence of several of South Sudan&#8217;s most populous tribal groups that this city is now embroiled in some of the bloodiest episodes of the current conflict engulfing the country. However, when that all subsides, the hope is that this multicultural gem – the third largest town in the nation no less – will flower once again. And boy does it have plenty to offer: from age-stained colonial frontispieces to the ramshackle huts and marketplaces constructed from the raw materials of the African bush! There&#8217;s also an interesting cathedral topped with a dome to see – one of the biggest in the region. "
Southern National Park,"Covering close to 7,800 square kilometers of land in the very heart of South Sudan, the seemingly endless swathes of patchwork woodlands and grassy savannah that form the Southern National Park are amongst the largest protected game areas in the nation. Curiously off-the-beaten-track for visitors to this part of Africa, the area has been little explored over the last 70 years. Those who do come will get to see the likes of the Congo lion, the colobus monkey, bushbabies, marabou storks and kobs aplenty. "
Kidepo Game Reserve,"The Kidepo Game Reserve is located in the southernmost depths of South Sudan. Contiguous with the famous Kidepo National Park in Uganda across the border, it&#8217;s a sea of greenery that extends for more than 1,200 square kilometers across the savannah grasslands and gallery woods of the region. One of the real pulls for would-be safari goers is the tame and human-friendly nature of the animals. You can expect to have up-close-and-personal encounters with elephants and defassa waterbuck, all of which wander right into the game lodges that pepper the boundaries of the reserve! "
Bandingilo National Park,"Another great place to come and witness the breathtaking phenomenon of the annual migration of the white-eared kob, Bandingilo National Park is the natural jewel of the Equatoria region. Spread out over the riparian grass plains that stretch eastwards from the White Nile River, it&#8217;s a surprisingly accessible place – thanks largely to that proximity to the capital at Juba; and surprising because stats show that still hardly anyone comes here! If you do decide to take the trip after the current Sudanese troubles reside, you can expect the likes of Nubian giraffes and elephants to pepper the vistas at Bandingilo! "
"Juba, South Sudan","Juba is not a city with a long story to tell. Founded only in 1922, it straddles the bends of the White Nile River in the deep southern reaches of the country. It was once just a far-flung trading outpost, built by Greek merchants who wanted to establish regular caravan routes between East Africa and Britain&#8217;s colonial bases. Since then, Juba has been a battleground in South Sudan&#8217;s civil wars, and been unexpectedly elevated to the status of capital in 2011. Although there&#8217;s not that much to see in this young epicentre of the nation (especially with the war raging all around), the town does have a bustling marketplace and a clutch of safari outfitters. "
Kodok,"Kodok was formerly known as Fashoda; the town that once gave its name to the famous Fashoda Incident, when the power struggles between Britain and France came to a head in Africa, and these two great superpowers of colonial Europe final decided to divvy up the continent on roughly east and west terms. Today, Kodok remembers these totemic episodes of African history, but also bears the remains of its onetime Shilluk kings. Unfortunately, modern times have proved difficult, with famine and war also scarring the settlement. "
Nimule National Park,"For its size, the Nimule National Park certainly packs one hell of a punch! With verdant forests and some of the most biodiverse riparian habitats in the nation, it plays host to everything from swinging baboons to hippos and snapping crocs. It&#8217;s cut through by the courses of the White Nile River, which can be seen drifting northwards towards Juba – the capital is just a short drive away, and safaris to Nimule can be organised from there. The piece de resistance has to be Opekoloe Island though, which is packed with roaming elephant herds. Or maybe it&#8217;s the Fola Falls, where local fishing folk cling to the rocks in their search of a catch. We can&#8217;t decide. "
"Bor, South Sudan","Once the site of some of the first ever Christian missions to be set up in this region of Africa, Bor is now something of an abandoned ghost town. The recent conflicts have really taken their toll, while the memory of massacres during the Sudanese Civil War are still raw and emotional – around 20,000 people were murdered here back in 1991! However, the current tumult notwithstanding, Bor still has its immersive tribal character, and it&#8217;s still one of the best places to come and see a traditional Sudanese wrestling match – the Muay Thai of Africa, if you will! "
Radom National Park,"Sprawled over the tenuous state lines where Sudan meets the Central African Republic, the protected reserves of the Radom National Park only find their way into South Sudan for a little part of their vast 1,250,000 hectares. However, that small section of reserve certainly counts, with visitors (and there are virtually none in these trying times) able to see endangered doka woods, roaming herds of elephants, tree-peppered savannah, hopping gazelles, and oodles of other rare East African beasts. Radom National Park can be hard to get to, with lengthy 4X4 drives from Raga the usual name of the game. "
Malakal,"Imbued with its own international airport and a prime location right on the edge of the White Nile River, you might think that Malakal of the north was a prosperous town. But the ravages of war have all but destroyed this erstwhile mercantile center. The marketplace now lays empty and the grand headquarters of the Upper Nile State Government stand deserted. Perhaps one day the life will return to its streets, and Malakal will be able to showcase its wild surroundings (made famous by the presence of the huge Ez Zeraf Reserve just to the south-east) again. "
Ez Zeraf Game Reserve,"Winding and weaving northwards through the very heart of South Sudan, the White Nile River delves into the vast wetlands known as the Sudd. Between packs of zebras and mud-caked elephants, the area hosts some jaw-dropping scenery in its vast 1.6 million acres of land. There are the seasonally flooded forests to navigate on canoes, soggy grassland plains and more, all dotted with the galumphing outlines of hippos and the occasional crocodile. It&#8217;s little wonder that Zeraf – the reserve that encompasses all that &#8211; is now one of the major points of focus for conservationists in east-central Africa! "
Shambe Nature Reserve,"First gazetted way back in the mid-1980s, the Shambe National Park can be seen as the southern extension of the aforementioned Ez Zeraf Reserve. That makes it home to an important part of the White Nile River ecosystem; a place of curious oxbow lakes and pop-up flood plains. Animal wise, you&#8217;ll get all of the biodiversity of the larger park to the north, along with lions and hippos, wild foxes and swinging primates of different kinds, not to mention elephants by the hundred! Shambe Nature Reserve is also a designated birding area, made popular thanks to countless migratory species that pass this way throughout the year. "
"Aweil, South Sudan","Now bolstered by the presence of all-new tarmac roads and the runways of its own airport, the city of Aweil represents one of the few glimpses of built-up development in the far-flung reaches of the Bahr el Ghazal region in northern South Sudan. A couple of hotels, a UN mission, restaurants and decent transport links make the place a good stopover point for travelers eager to make the border to the north, or those heading to the remote wilds of the Radom National Park in the west. What&#8217;s more, Aweil has proved itself resilient to the recent upheavals of the nation, with far less sectarian violence occurring here than in other cities. "
Gogrial,"The onetime home and birthplace of the legendary NBA player and activist Manute Bol (if you believe the locals, that is), Gogrial is the epicentre of its own eponymous state: Gogrial State. It&#8217;s got its own airport (just a dust airstrip that&#8217;s suitable for small fliers) too, which us peppered with the decaying remains of old bomber planes left over from the Sudanese Civil War. And its neatly delineated by the courses of the Jur River, which bends and winds away into the distance before converging with the mighty White Nile. "
Sheffield,"If there&#8217;s  a model for how to be a post-industrial city Sheffield would definitely be in the running. After a couple of decades of regeneration the centre is creative, fun and young, full of nightlife and culture. Some of this dynamism is owed to Sheffield&#8217;s large university population, but also sights like the Millennium Galleries and the fabulous Winter Garden, which was unveiled in 2003. And then there&#8217;s the time-honoured institutions like the Crucible Theatre, which has welcomed the World Snooker Championship since the 1970s. Steel is still manufactured around Sheffield, and there are also well-preserved mills and machinery at Kelham Island and the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet. "
"Doncaster, England","Any British town with the &#8220;caster&#8221; suffix was once a Roman fortress so this applies to Doncaster. The town lies on a large coal seam and this attracted industry starting in the 1700s, though there are many strings to Doncaster&#8217;s bow. One of these is aviation, made clear at the Vulcan Experience, showcasing the Avro Vulcan, which was assembled in Doncaster, and the South Yorkshire Aircraft Museum, a trove of 20th-century helicopters and planes at a former RAF hangar. If you&#8217;re around in late-summer two of England&#8217;s most valuable races on the flat are run at the historic Doncaster Racecourse; the St Leger Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. "
Barnsley Town Hall,"Coal-mining and glassmaking were the foundations of the economy in Barnsley, but after the last local pit closed in the 90s the town staged an economic recovery and has enough to keep you occupied for a day or so. A lot of the allure lies in the grand estates and country parks close to the town, some of which we&#8217;ll cover later. The big monument in Barnsley is the town hall, which was completed in 1932 and is large enough to be seen from the undulating hillsides miles outside the town. There&#8217;s a high-quality social history museum inside, conveying the mining heritage that disappeared in the space of a couple of decades. Monday to Saturday, call in at Barnsley&#8217;s market, which has been running since the 14th century and has more than 300 stalls. "
"Rotherham, England","Coal, iron, steel, pottery and glass: These were the industries that caused Rotherham to expand in the 1700s, but the town had been a significant place for centuries before that. Rotherham Bridge will illustrate this fact nicely; the structure over the River Don was built in 1483 and is rare in the UK as a chapel is an integral part of the structure. To get your head around Rotherham go to the Clifton Museum, where the town&#8217;s industry will be laid bare and there&#8217;s a big display of the prized Rockingham pottery which was fashioned in local kilns. "
Peak District,"Sheffield is billed as the eastern gateway to the Peak District National Park, which covers a majestic and sparsely populated upland region. In these northern stretches of the park you&#8217;ll journey into barren sandstone moorland, which has a wild and desolate allure that brings Wuthering Heights to mind. There will be rugged sandstone walls delineating pasture, dales dotted with sheep and lots of remote hamlets and villages where time seems to have stood still. Sheffield has road and train links delivering you to the park in a matter of minutes. "
Wentworth Woodhouse,"North of Rotherham, Wentworth is a beautiful village of sandstone cottages and imposing houses, some clad with ivy. A lot of the buildings on Main Street are listed, and many are restaurants, pubs and local village shops. The village has been here since the 11th century, and ever-present throughout this time has been the Holy Trinity Church, now in an arresting state of semi -ruin. But the headline attraction is the jaw-dropping Wentworth Woodhouse, a stunning 18th-century country estate that melds English baroque with Palladian design. You won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that a host of period TV shows and films have been shot in this noble setting. "
Cannon Hall farm,"Cawthorne has all the essentials of an English rural village, with a pretty medieval church, a pub tea room and manor house. The local stately home, Cannon Hall is a gorgeous Georgian pile that wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in a Jane Austen period drama. In the ballroom, dining room, library and drawing room there&#8217;s sumptuous period furniture by some of the 18th-century&#8217;s most lauded craftsmen like Thomas Chippendale and George Hepplewhite. Bring the kids to Cannon Hall farm where you can watch state-of-the art farming machinery at work, and see tractors trundling around like any other day. The best time to visit is in spring when hundreds of baby animals are born, and you&#8217;ll get to see Shetland pony and donkey foals, as well as piglets and lambs. "
Woodlands,"Preserved as a conservation area just north of Doncaster, Woodlands is a model village, built at the turn of the century  for miners at Brodsworth Colliery. The Model Village Movement came about at the end of the 19th century, as industrialists realised the benefit of giving their workforce more desirable places to live. At Woodlands there&#8217;s generous green in six hectares hemmed by some 120 houses. These were devised to face the greenery rather than other houses as they would a typical industrial residential street. "
Cusworth Hall,"This parish a short way west of Doncaster has three individual villages and some pristine expanses of countryside to recharge those batteries. The Spotbrough Flash is a soothing patchwork of wetland, meadows and ash and sycamore woods on a limestone ridge. In grassy areas there&#8217;s a sea of wildflowers like cowslips and orchids in summer. The grounds of Cusworth Hall are dreamy too, with a serpentine lake with ducks and a glorious Georgian mansion at the top of the rise, designed by James Paine, one of the country&#8217;s foremost architects of the day. The interior is a museum that shows how Doncastrians, rich and not so rich, lived in days gone by. "
"Bradfield Church, High Bradfield","This endearing little village is set within the boundary of the Peak District, in hilly scenery with vistas over the Bradfield Dale to the Derwent Edge escarpment and a massive sweep of the Dark Peak. Nestling in pasture for sheep grazing, it&#8217;s a given that High Bradfield should be fine walking territory, and there&#8217;s some fascinating stuff to discover minutes on foot from the village. One is Bailey Hill, which has all the signs of a Normal motte and bailey fortress, while Castle Hill was once a Saxon camp. In the village, the Church of St Nicholas is one of a select few Grade I-listed buildings in the Sheffield region. It takes full advantage of the majestic location and has a Saxon cross in its nave from the year 800. "
Penistone,"The likeable market town of Penistone is the highest in Yorkshire, at over 220 metres. Here on the western side of the county, at the edge of the Pennines, the countryside starts to get dramatic. There are five superb local walks starting in Penistone, entering a landscape of arable farms and pasture grazed by the hardy whitefaced woodland sheep. And there will always be a pub close by for a meal or leisurely pint. For people in need of outdoor seclusion you have the empty moorland around the Langsett Reservoir where you could stroll for hours and hardly meet a soul. In the town see the Church of St John the Baptist, with a 16th-century tower and a nave and chancel that could be as old as the 11th century. "
Elsecar Heritage Railway Centre,"In rolling countryside between Rotherham and Barnsley, the village of Elsecar witnessed coal-mining activity from the 15th century to the 1980s. Despite and maybe because of that history Elsecar has a lot of personality, on streets with old stone cottages and the converted vestiges of the mines&#8217; outbuildings and iron forges. At the Elsecar Heritage Centre are restored cobblestone streets and workshops that still have machinery to keep industrial historians riveted: The 18th-century Newcomen Beam Engine dates to 1795 and was designed to extract water from coal pits to allow for deeper exploration. You could linger at the heritage centre for a good while, pottering around the sweet independent shops and taking a ride on the mile-long Elsecar Heritage Railway. "
Worsbrough Mill,"A diffuse cluster of villages in dramatic countryside, Worsbrough has been settled since the 600s and was mentioned in the Domesday Book in the 11th century. Worsbrough Mill on the River Dove is a working flour mill that still has both its water-powered mechanism that goes back to the 1600s and its 19th-century steam apparatus. As well as offering a couple of hours of edification, the location is fabulous, within the 100-hectare Worsbrough Country Park. Following the course of the former railway line through Worsbrough is a length of the Trans Pennine Trail, which spans both coasts in northern England. Pause a moment at the 12th-century Church of St Mary, which has a mass grave for the 75 victims of the Darley Main Colliery disaster in 1849. "
High Hoyland,"A destination for a whirlwind visit, but one you&#8217;re sure to recall fondly, High Hoyland is a tiny hillside village northwest of Barnsley. You&#8217;ll know why you came when you&#8217;re sitting in front of the Cherry Tree Inn and staring dumbstruck at the views down to Cannon Hall and then Barnsley in the distance. You can park up and join a footpath to spend a little more time in this wonderful setting; there&#8217;s a old bridleway that runs along the ridge above the village. Just up the road from High Hoyland is the Yorkshire Sculpture Park with works by Barbara Hepworth and one of the largest sets of Henry Moore&#8217;s bronzes anywhere. "
"Parish Church of St. Nicholas Thorne, Thorne England","The market town of Thorne has a few interesting stories to tell and some rare wilderness to navigate. Thorne was a marshy region until the Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden helped create polders (reclaimed farmland) in the 1600s by plotting a system of dykes. You can see how the landscape once looked at the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve, more than 2,800 hectares of bogs and woods supporting more than 5,000 plant and animal species. Birds like ringed plovers, lapwings and oystercatchers are all to be seen and heard in summer. Inside Thorne, stretch your legs on the tow path of the Stainforth and Keadby canal and bring the little guys to the miniature that runs in summer at Thorne Park. "
Sierra Nevada,"Not to be confused with the region of the same name in the United States, the Sierra Nevada in Spain is a mountain range that features Spain’s highest peak, the Mulhacén. If you enjoy all things snow related then don’t miss a trip to one of the many ski resorts in the region where you will find skiing and snowboarding opportunities, and can stay in quaint ski chalets. Also not to be missed is the Sierra Nevada National Park that covers the region, and where you can experience the great outdoors and learn all about the local flora and fauna of this wintery corner of Spain. "
"Catedral de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela","Often referred to simply as Santiago, this city in the semi-autonomous region of Galicia lies in the north west of Spain, and the big draw here is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Old Town. The city is famous as an important pilgrimage site for Christians, having been a place of historic importance during the struggle between different religious groups in the days of old, and Old Town features the iconic Santiago Cathedral with its two intricately carved towers. Old Town also provides visitors with the chance to stroll along winding lanes in search of toothsome tapas or local craft souvenirs, and the area is known for being lovingly and tastefully restored and preserved, giving you the feeling that you have truly stepped back in time. "
Almeria,"Located in Andalusia, Almeria is the place to come if you want to spend time on undisturbed and pristine beaches, away from the usual tourist hordes. Known for being one of the warmest spots in all of Spain, you can enjoy the sunshine and the seaside almost all year round, and if you really want to get away from it all then head to Playa San Pedro, a strip of beach that can only be accessed on foot, and which is home to a small population who live on the water. Aside from the beach and the sea there are caves to explore and you can pitch a tent if you want to stay longer and enjoy the relaxed pace of life. For another slice of history in Almeria, visit the famous Gold Mines, now no longer in use, and learn about the geology of the area at the mine museum. "
Costa Brava,"Translated as ‘wild’ or ‘rough’ coast, the Costa Brava is one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Spain due to its warm weather, abundance of beaches, and hospitable atmosphere. As well as sandy beaches there are also natural park areas that have been protected from development, such as Montseny Natural Park, that will give visitors a glimpse of unspoiled nature and aims to teach travelers about the wildlife and plant life of the Andalusia region. For more natural gems, travelers can check out the islands around the Costa Brava such as the chain of seven islands called the Medes Islands. "
Toledo,"Found to the south of Madrid, the city of Toledo has a long and complicated history due to the presence of so many foreign influences that has lead to it being known as the ‘City of the Three Cultures’ thanks to the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian populations that co-exist in the city. The main cathedral in Toledo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and dates from the 13th century and is built in the Gothic and Baroque styles. The historic centre of Toledo is also well worth a visit and has a rabbit warren of streets that lead you on a maze-like adventure where you can seek out small cafes and bistros as well as local arts and crafts shops. "
"The Alhambra, Granada","The city of Granada is famous for its place in medieval history, particularly during the period of the Moors, and many visitors flock to the region to see the mighty and majestic Alhambra palace. The building, built by a sultan during the 11th century, also had the dual purpose of serving as a fort and there is much to see including traditional Moorish architecture and a history lesson in the different periods of conquest in Spain. Aside from Arabic architecture, you can also visit classical Catholic monasteries such as Monasterio de la Cartuja, or just wonder the winding and charming cobbled streets. Keep a lookout for the local street art and graffiti that is often present in Granada, a sign of the artistic and often political nature of this city. "
Royal Theater of Madrid,"The capital of Spain, Madrid is an exciting and diverse city that is home to the mighty Prado Museum, a must-visit for art lovers wishing to see world famous works by Goya, Velázquez, and El Greco. For those who love architecture, head to Madrid’s Royal Palace, an elaborately decorated building that dates from the 17th century and has an armory attached that showcases examples of early weaponry. From the palace, visitors can swing by Plaza Mayor, the city’s main square that has portico style buildings and where you can while away the afternoon roaming the cobblestone streets that lead off the square to small boutiques and eateries. At night Madrid has a thriving and diverse music and entertainment scene, so you can dance the night away or just enjoy some live music and local cuisine in one of the city’s many restaurants. If you like fine dining, then Madrid is leading the way in upscale versions of local classics "
Pamplona,"Pamplona is the capital of the province of Navarre in the north of Spain, but if it is synonymous with anything then it is surely the annual Running of the Bulls festival in which bulls are set to run through the narrow streets and chase revelers who run ahead of them. The festival is usually held in July, and if you happen to visit at another time then there is still much to do. The city is a famous pilgrimage site along the well trodden route to Santiago de Compostela, and is full of interesting sites like Saint Nicólas Church, another example of Gothic architecture that looks like a fortress from the outside. "
Barcelona,"Come to Barcelona for the beaches, the hidden historical treasures in the winding streets, and the delectable seafood and flowing wines in the region. If you like the seaside then make straight for Barceloneta Beach where you can enjoy the bracing sea air and unspoiled views over the Mediterranean. If you are an art lover then explore the Gaudi buildings found all over Barcelona, including Le Pedrera and the word famous Casa Battló that looks like something out of an absurdist dream. If you want to sample some of the best food in Spain then visit La Boqueria, a local market that dates back to the 13th century and features towering piles of produce from the region. If you are feeling hungry after a long day exploring the city, then the area around La Boquria is filled with cafes and restaurants that are perfect for some delicious tapas. "
Cordoba,"Come to Cordoba for a taste of the Muslim influence in Spain, particularly in the form of the La Mezquita or the Great Mosque that still stands in the city and is a true marvel of Moorish architecture with towering domes, marble columns, and gold trimmings. The Old Town of Cordoba is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and aside from the Great Mosque, there are also cathedrals, Roman bridges, Roman ruins, mausoleums, and amphitheatres for history buffs to visit. The Muslim influence is still strong in Cordoba and many of the local cafes showcase Arabic food and serve traditional hookah pipes. "
Avila,"Also dubbed ‘The Town of Stones and Saints’, Avila is an often under visited gem that claims to boast one of the largest collections of Romanesque and Gothic churches in all of Spain. Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and dating from the 11th century, the town is famous for its towering cathedral and the old town walls that still stand to this day. A trip to Avila is like a walk through history, and there are monasteries, towers, fortifications, museums, and palaces that make you feel as if you have wandered into the pages of a history book. At night, you can sample the local cuisine and wines in one of the many local restaurants and bars that are also found all over the town, and are said to rival the churches in Avila in terms of sheer numbers. "
Salamanca,"A university town that has the claim to fame of housing the oldest university in Spain, Salamanca is yet another UNESCO World Heritage Site, and features Baroque style squares, the best example of which is the Plaza Mayor in the city centre. There is also Romanesque architecture on offer in the form of two cathedrals that are connected and have elements of Baroque and Renaissance architecture, and many of the buildings in Salamanca are crafted from local sandstone, giving them a bronzed glow under the afternoon sun. Nowadays the city still has a large and diverse student population giving it an exciting atmosphere as well as a feeling of being the intellectual capital of Spain, and you will find cozy hang outs and bars aplenty to spend an afternoon of evening in. "
Seville,"Shrouded in myth that claims that <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-seville-spain/"">Seville</a> was founded by the Greek god Hercules some 3,000 years ago, this city is a mass of different influences and provides a perfect walk through Spain’s often complicated history. There are Roman ruins to explore, as well as traces of the Moorish conquest, particularly in the Santa Cruz quarter at the Alcázar, a place built by Muslim kings and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its architectural beauty and importance. If you stroll down to the riverfront, you can take a moment to visit the Torre del Oro, a watchtower built to protect the city against intruders trying to attack via the Guadalquivir River. At night, Seville’s friendly and welcoming spirit really shines through, and you can listen to live music and enjoy delicious tapas that showcases the fresh seafood found in Seville like squid, dogfish, and swordfish. "
Cadiz,"<a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-cadiz-spain/"">Cadiz</a> is not actually an island city but it may well feel that way to visitors, as the city is almost completely surrounded by water, so except pounding waves, salty air, and seagulls. Much of old Cadiz would have been heavily fortified, so make for one of the best preserved examples of this at the Castillo de San Sebastian that stands on its own island, and learn about the history of protecting Cadiz from marauders from the sea. Less visited by travelers, Cadiz has retained much of its old world charm, and you can roam around the local markets where you will find an abundance of fresh produce and seafood. If you want to try some sea inspired tapas later on in the day, then head for La Caleta Beach and let the smell of grilled fish be your guide. "
Burgos,"Found in northern Spain, this former historic capital of the Castile autonomous region is known for its stunning architecture, particularly in the form of the many churches and cathedrals that span the city. Of them all, perhaps the most famous is the Gothic Cathedral of Burgos, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and built to reflect Gothic architecture at its most ornate. Burgos also has a quaint and compact historic centre that is perfect for travelers looking to spend lazy days wandering the streets, and you will also find portions of the original ruins of the fortified city walls. As Burgos sits on the tributaries of the Arlanzón River, admire the view as you walk along the banks of Fuentes Blancas, the largest park in Burgos that allows you to enjoy the water as well as indulge in camping, biking, or simply strolling and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. "
Lichfield Cathedral,"You could make the case for Lichfield to be one of England&#8217;s most beautiful towns. There are many streets of sublime 18th-century architecture, and the breathtaking Lichfield Cathedral, built in the 13th century and the only medieval cathedral anywhere to have three spires. Lichfield has brains as well as beauty, as two of 18th-century Britain&#8217;s cultural heavyweights are associated with the city. The writer Samuel Johnson was born here in 1709, and is considered among Britain&#8217;s greatest men of letters. Johnson&#8217;s birthplace has been preserved as a museum, while the home of the polymath Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) is a enthralling museum in a beautiful property. "
Stoke-on-Trent,"A complete contrast to Lichfield, Stoke, in the north of the county, has a gritty character but is no less appealing if you know what you&#8217;re looking for. Stoke is actually a federation of six different but contiguous towns, and its claim to fame for hundreds of years has been the pottery industry. This has faded since the Second World War, but brands like Royal Doulton and Wedgwood are still based here. The Gladstone Pottery Museum in Longton is a functioning coal-fired pottery, with the signature bottle kilns that used to pepper the landscape. Go deeper at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, which has exquisite displays of local ceramics, but also has some of the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest cache of Anglo-Saxon metalwork ever discovered. "
Stafford,"The county town is a small but attractive place crammed with historical buildings, and with elegant country houses like Shugborough Estate and Sandon Hall minutes from the centre. On the pedestrianised Greengate Street, Stafford&#8217;s main shopping artery, feast your eyes on the Ancient High House. This remarkable four-storey cantilevered house was built in 1594 and the carpenters&#8217; marks etched into the timbers indicate that they had once belonged to an even older house. Charles I stayed at this very property in 1643, shortly after the start of the Civil War. A siege took place at Stafford Castle in this war, and once it fell into Parliamentarian hands it was pulled down. "
Tamworth Castle,"Staffordshire&#8217;s second-largest town has been around for a very long time, and was the capital of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Mercia, which took up almost all of central England in the 8th century. The majestic Tamworth Castle, perched above the confluence of the Anker and Tame rivers has Anglo-Saxon origins, having been fortified by the Mercian Queen Æthelflæd and then rebuilt by the Normans. Now it&#8217;s one of the most complete original motte and bailey castles in England. Tamworth&#8217;s old town is replete with lovely period properties, many now housing independent shops. "
Staffordshire Moorlands,"Staffordshire has the southwestern corner of this National Park, and the area is known as the Staffordshire Moorlands. There&#8217;s a load of individual beauty spots to visit and an inexhaustible choice of footpaths, bridleways and cycling tracks wending through the brooding moors. Rudyard Lake is an 18th-century water reservoir created to feed the Caldon Canal. The Victorians turned it into a little resort, and, with its wooded hillsides and miniature steam railway, it&#8217;s still a big draw today . The writer Rudyard Kipling, whose parents were frequent visitors,  was named after Rudyard Lake. "
"Leek, England","As Staffordshire&#8217;s last town before the Peak District, Leek is a tourist-friendly destination welcoming walkers and anyone enticed by the blend of verdant countryside and wild moorland all around. The town itself is a former centre for the silk and textiles industries. These granted Leek a host of dignified Georgian and Victorian buildings, best seen at the Market Place which is a pleasure to wander around for a while. One of Leek&#8217;s most imposing buildings is the old Nicholson Institute, and inside is a museum with, among other things, an assortment of the embroideries that won the town fame in the 19th century. For awesome rocky scenery there&#8217;s the Roaches, a sandstone ridge above the Tittesworth Reservoir, and the Manifold Way on the route of an old train line past limestone rock formations. "
"St Giles&#8217; Catholic Church, Cheadle","A coal town for hundreds of years, Cheadle switched to high-tech manufacturing in the 1990s, although none of this industry intrudes on the picturesque town centre. The standout landmark in Cheadle is St Giles&#8217; Catholic Church, one of the definitive examples of 19th-century gothic revival architecture. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, who also designed London&#8217;s Houses of Parliament and took responsibility for even the tiniest decorative details, which grants this building a coherence that is hard to find anywhere else. Being on the edge of the Peak District Cheadle is in prime walking country, while the old Foxfield Steam Railway also courses through the region and is a glorious way to experience the countryside of northeastern Staffordshire. "
Burton upon Trent,"From the 1700s, Burton&#8217;s presence on the navigable Trent and England&#8217;s growing canal network helped it become one of Europe&#8217;s big brewing towns. Burton&#8217;s ales were soon delivered across the country and also exported to the Baltic states. The National Brewery Centre is set in what was once the brewery for Bass ale, and give you fascinating insights about how beer-making developed in this part of England. There are also stables with shire horses, a variety famous for its &#8220;feathered legs&#8221; and bred to transport barrels of ale. On the north side of the town is something you won&#8217;t find very often: A completely restored Victorian public utility. In this case, the Claymills Pumping Station, which once pumped sewage with the help of four large beam pumping engines. "
Newcastle-under-Lyme,"There has been a market in Newcastle since 1173 and in the 21st century it&#8217;s still flourishing. Safe to say the town wouldn&#8217;t be the same without it, as the high street  market runs six days a week. The best days to visit are Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays when the general market trades cheese, meat, fruit and vegetables and well as hot food like freshly baked pies. There is acres of well-tended green space around the town, and Newcastle has been recognised by the Britain in Bloom campaign for its flowery parks and roundabouts. Drama fans should find out what&#8217;s on at the New Vic Theatre, which became the first ever purpose-built Theatre in  the Round (a stage entirely encircled by seating) when it opened in 1986. "
Trentham Hall,"On the southern side of Stoke, the village of Trentham is best-known for the Trentham Estate, which was dominated by a magnificent hall up to the 20th century when it was torn down. The hall&#8217;s clock tower, church and sculpture gallery survived and offer a sense of the splendour of the estate. The Italianate gardens backing onto the River Trent are still here too, and are fabulous, boasting formal lawns, stone vases and balustrades. Also wildly popular is the Trentham Monkey Forest, an exceptional animal attraction in which some 140 Barbary macaques live in semi-freedom in the boughs of woodland above your head. "
Barlaston Hall,"Established in 1759, Wedgwood is probably the most prestigious name in English ceramics, producing porcelain and fine china. The Wedgwood Estate covers almost 100 hectares, and is a place where you could easily lose a day if you&#8217;re into decorative art. You&#8217;ll be shown around the factory to see time-honoured skills in action, and learn about the storied history of the Wedgwood family at the museum. The Wedgwood factory shop is also on the estate and has discounts on the retail price, and there are tea rooms naturally using Wedgwood china. A brief drive down the road and you&#8217;ll reach Barlaston Golf Club, on the banks of the Trent and rated as one of the best courses in the county. "
"Stone, Staffordshire","Like Burton, the town of Stone has a brewing legacy that can be charted back to the 1700s. There were two big brewers in the town, harnessing the exceptional water quality of Stone&#8217;s springs and then using the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal for distribution. The old brewers have shut down, but you can get a good look at the solemn brick warehouse of Joule&#8217;s Brewery beside the canal, which is now popular with narrowboat holidaymakers. The craft beer trend has prompted a rebirth of the industry in Stone: The new Lymestone Brewery is only too happy to show you how they make their ales and uses the old facilities at Bents, one of Stone&#8217;s defunct breweries. "
"Haughton, staffordshire","Every year there&#8217;s a county-wide competition to pick the &#8220;best-kept&#8221; village in Staffordshire, and in 2015 and 2016 Haughton has come out on top. This sense of pride is obvious at Christmas when the residents decorate their homes with lavish light displays to raise money for charity. The countryside is dairy pasture bounded by hedgerows. The Red Lion Farm makes ice cream containing milk produced on site by a herd of Jersey Cows. You can introduce little ones to the farm&#8217;s cows, goats, horses and alpacas, and book a table at the restaurant that has a menu with lots of ingredients that come right from the farm. "
Uttoxeter Racecourse,"In the east of the county, Uttoxter is a market town by the River Dove and folded into a green landscape. The meadows by the river are particularly lush, and after a ramble through the local countryside you&#8217;ll note that dairy farming has a role to play in Uttoxeter&#8217;s economy. One local boy made good was Joseph Cyril Bamford, whose initials are given to the JCB construction machinery company, known for their excavators and founded just after the Second World War. The JCB plant is in Rocester near Uttoxeter and offers tours. If you&#8217;re in town in March you could go and see the Midlands Grand National, a steeplechase run at Uttoxeter Racecourse and the most valuable meeting on the calendar. "
"Alton, Staffordshire","In hilly north Staffordshire, this twee old village of sandstone cottages on a few sloping streets betrays few signs of the gigantic attraction that is right on its doorstep. Alton Towers is in the grounds of the former home of the Earls of Shrewsbury and  also occupies the site of the Alton&#8217;s former copper works. It would usually be placed in the top ten-attended theme parks in Europe but for a well-documented accident in 2015. If that doesn&#8217;t put you off then you can make the most of the shorter queues for a massive range of splash rides, rollercoasters, themed shows and an indoor water park, for the next couple of years at least! "
Meroe,"The onetime epicentre of the ancient Napata Kingdom is a truly otherworldly place to explore. Set out between the ochre-hued rises of the Sudanese desert, just north of the capital, its comprised of over 200 individual pyramid structures, along with a whole serious of fascinating ruins of another type. This bears all the hallmarks of a grand architectural undertaking in the same ilk as the Nubian cities of old, and today the whole area has been accredited by UNESCO, and archaeological findings have confirmed the presence of an advanced civilisation of iron smelters and traders with mercantile links all the way to China and India! "
Suakin,"Sand-blown Suakin stands tall and firm against the gusts of the Red Sea. An iconic and historic place that still touts its medieval past with pride, it was once one of the major staging points for Muslim pilgrims making the hop across to Arabian Mecca from North Africa. Consequently, there are gilded mosques and interesting religious structures carved from coral stone, all of which mingle with the occasional Ottoman relic – Suakin later succumbed to the Turks, but fell into swift decline as European traders opened up routes around the Cape of Good Hope. "
Khartoum,"Khartoum is perhaps best known as the mythical location where the two great strands of the River Nile combine before heading northwards into the ancient lands of Nubia and Egypt. The city straddles the banks of this famous water way, and even pokes out into the famous confluence at the headland known as al-Mogran. In the heart of the town, strips like Nile Street (which unsurprisingly run alongside the Blue Nile) are packed with pretty buildings of arabesque design. This is also where you&#8217;ll see the grandiose Presidential Palace, protected religiously by zealous guards. Nearby is the hustle and bustle of Souq Arabi – the more frenetic and mercantile hub of the capital. "
Kerma,"Another great ancient relic left on the meanders of the Nile River from the civilisations of old, Kerma promises to be an experience like no other in the country. At its center rises the soaring and mighty Western Deffufa – one of the largest and oldest adobe worshipping houses on the planet! And once you&#8217;re done getting over the sheer awesomeness of that centrepiece, you can move to tour the seemingly endless array of ruins that surround it (one of the largest in all of North African, in fact). These go from burial complexes to the unearthed statues of old Nubian deities, all of which boast a history going back more than 5,000 years! "
Dinder National Park,"The Dinder National Park is a triangle cut-out of protected land that buts right up to the Ethiopian border in the south-east of the country. Made up of sprawling arid grass plains that glow yellow and come sun-baked under the heat of the equatorial sun, it occupies a unique habitat right where the great highlands of Ethiopia drop down to the northern African flats. That means visitors can see the likes of lions prowling, their beady eyes focused on the bushbucks and springing antelope. And then there are the curious long-legged North African ostriches, which are a common and eye-opening sight. "
Sanganeb National Park,"The first and only oceanic national park in all of Sudan, the Sanganeb National Park is made up of shallow reef habitats that showcase the sheer biodiversity of the Red Sea in all its glory. The protected area is adjoined directly to the jetties and harbors of Port Sudan, making it a very accessible place to visit. Divers can go underwater and case out layered coral gardens, witness multi-coloured tropical fish, and understand why the spot was added to the UNESCO list back in the early 1990s (along with the greater Dungonab Bay). There&#8217;s also an old lighthouse where snorkelers can moor up and spend some days enjoying the wonder! "
Port Sudan,"Situated more than 20 hours by rattling train through the dusty deserts of upper Sudan from the capital, the country&#8217;s only large port is home to nearly 500,000 people. It crashes down to the sparkling waters of the Red Sea in a medley of creaking cranes and endless depot complexes, all ticking over to the lurch of massive tankers prepping for the Suez Canal and the chatter of down-to-earth dock workers from all over the globe. For tourists, it&#8217;s the diving that really takes the biscuit though &#8211;  it&#8217;s undeveloped, unchartered and offers a cheap way to see the coral-clad depths of this crystal-clear sea. "
Omdurman,"The largest city in Sudan is actually now more or less contiguous with the capital at Khartoum. It can be found facing its near brother on the far side of the White Nile, rising up from the banks at the legendary confluence at al-Mogran. However, where Khartoum comes crowned with old palaces and blue-domed mosques, Omdurman is peppered with throbbing souqs and bazaars. The most impressive of these is surely the eponymous Souq Omdurman, which is said to be the single largest market in all of Africa! The house of the old Khalifa is also located here, and makes a perfect stop for those interested in unravelling tales of Sudan&#8217;s colonial relations with the United Kingdom. Oh, and be sure not to miss the shows of Twirling Dervishes that erupt here each Friday! "
Bahri,"Technically a standalone city from its namesake across the bends of the Blue Nice, the area of North Khartoum, also known locally as just Bahri, claims the title of the third-largest city in the country. For visitors, there&#8217;s not that much in the way of sights and attractions, mainly on account of Bahri&#8217;s clear industrial and mechanical character. However, you&#8217;ll see sprawling docks on the river, and endless depots bursting with cotton and kiln-cooked red bricks, all waiting for transportation north. There&#8217;s also the striking ruins of the Al-Shifa plant, which was destroyed by a cruise missile during the troubles of the late 90s! "
Arkawit,"Perched over 1,000 meters above the crashing waters of the Red Sea, the resort town of Arkawit is the perfect escape for travelers finding it hard to handle the soaring equatorial temperatures of the Sudanese coast. With the soothing breezes of the highlands at hand, visitors can take some time to kick back and relax in rustic guesthouses, enjoying the green-hued hills and rocky landscapes that abound around the area. Walking is prime here too, with treks out to case the acacia-spotted ridges of Jebel Danaieb often done in the company of Sudan&#8217;s native monkeys! "
Jebel Marra,"Rising in sinewy ridges atop the dusty plains of Darfur in the western reaches of Sudan, the Jebel Marra are perhaps the original African badlands. They are carved and chipped massifs of ancient volcanic stone that have been forged from eruption after eruption over the millennia. The most recent additions to the landscape are a colossal water-filled caldera known as the Deriba Crater, which is thought to have appeared following the pyroclastic flows of an explosion in 1,500 BC (that&#8217;s like yesterday to a volcanologist!). Jebel Marra itself is the highest peak in the country, clocking up more than 3,088 meters, and boasting beautiful waterfalls and canyons around its base. "
Kassala,"Don&#8217;t let the sweeping flatlands of farming land and irrigated fields of green fool you as you make your way to far-flung Kassala in the south-eastern reaches of Sudan, close to the border with Eritrea. The wild throws of Mother Nature are still very much in command in these landscapes, and you only need to look upwards towards the horizon to see why! That&#8217;s where the bulbous peaks and troughs of the Taka Mountains loom, surrounded by sandy canyons and carved gorges of desert stone. From the top of these you can see into Eritrea, while around the bottom you can settle for a traditional Sudanese coffee with the locals! "
Naqa,"Mind-blowing Naqa sits in the shadow of the Jabal Naqa, some 170 kilometers from the capital at Khartoum. A place of ancient treasures, the town has been reduced to a conglomeration of ruined peristyles and sun-cracked stone by the centuries. But the magic is still very much alive, thanks largely to the trio of temples that form the centrepiece here. These start with the haunting Temple of Amun, which bursts with old steles of the Egyptian deity Amun-Ra. Then there&#8217;s Apedemak&#8217;s worship house, adorned with the figures of the ancient kings of Kush. Finally, there&#8217;s the Roman Kiosk, displaying a fusion of Mediterranean, Hellenistic, Arabic and North African styles. "
Wadi Halfa,"One of the northernmost towns in the nation, the low-rise sprawl of Wadi Halfa sits between two ridges of desert rock and the waters of Lake Nubia. While today it bustles with the coming and going of traders from Egypt, its main draw lies in its onetime inhabitants from the Middle Kingdom period. And while Wadi Halfa itself might not be of mega importance in the search for Nubian treasures, the occurrence of Lake Nasser in the 1970s meant that archaeologists came here to focus their efforts in recovering the relics that had been submerged up and down the valley. "
Bury St Edmunds Cathedral,"Proud host of the only cathedral in Suffolk, Bury St Edmunds may well be the most beautiful town in the county. There&#8217;s history from all sorts of different periods, and many buildings in the town are even older than they look because the old timber-framing was bricked over in the 1700s, as was the Georgian fashion. St Edmundsbury Cathedral should be on your agenda, as should the ruined Bury St Edmunds Abbey, standing in serene gardens that you enter via a stunning Norman gateway. More recent but no less fabulous is the Theatre Royal, the only surviving regency theatre in England, newly restored to its pre-Victorian glory. The Greene King brewery is also in Bury St Edmunds, brewing ale for more than 200 years and welcoming you for tours. "
Ipswich,"On the Orwell Estuary, Ipswich is a town that vies for the title of the oldest in England. Its history goes back to the 600s when a Saxon settlement took shape around the docks. All the way through the middle ages, Ipswich was a key port for trade with Europe. This legacy is recognised during the Ipswich Maritime Festival in August when there are street markets, historical re-enactments and old sailboats visit the town. As it was in the past, the waterside area is the most engaging part of Ipswich, where old warehouses are now apartments, restaurants and galleries, and the University of Suffolk injects some youthful energy. In the Buttermarket area, see the Ancient House, a fine 14th-century merchant&#8217;s house embellished with the &#8220;pargeting&#8221;, decorative plasterwork, that East Anglia is known for. "
Southwold Pier,"Suffolk has a speciality in charming, understated seaside towns, and Southwold is one of the best. Take the pier for instance, which instead of tacky amusements has a restaurant, cute little cafes and vintage-style coin-operated machines that have helped win it &#8220;Pier of Year&#8221;. Further down the coast, the oldest part of Southwold is a knot of painted old houses and maritime inns, all commanded by the Southwold Lighthouse, commissioned in 1890 and still working today, guiding vessels into the harbour and sending a warning signal 24 miles out to sea. Call in for a look around and to climb the 92 steps to the platform at the top. "
Newmarket Racecourse,"In the far west of the county, the name of this fabled market town is practically a byword of horseracing. Newmarket is the birthplace of the sport, with races recorded as far back as the 12th century. It is also the centre for horse-breeding and training in England, and the Jockey Club is headquartered right in the town. To illustrate its status, nine of Britain&#8217;s 32 prestigious Group 1 races are run at the Newmarket Racecourse, which also has the National Horseracing Museum, indispensable for anyone interested in the sport. "
Lavenham,"The Suffolk Wool Towns are considered among the best-preserved medieval settlements in England. These got rich from the wool trade in the middle ages, when nearly all of their landmarks were built. Lavenham, now a village, was once one of the wealthiest towns in England and now has some 340 listed buildings. One of these is the Church of St Peter and St Paul, completed in 1525 and seen as a masterwork of Late Perpendicular Gothic design, crammed with wondrous decoration, like the 14th-century painted rood screen. There&#8217;s loads more to see, like the 16th-century timber Guildhall, which recounts Lavenham&#8217;s history perfectly as it was a hub for business in the 1500s, but by Victorian times was a workhouse once the wool trade had died off. Lavenham&#8217;s architecture appeared in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts I and II. "
"Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford","A fine complement to Lavenham, Long Melford is also a Wool Town and has lots of sumptuous architecture from the time when it was booming. Kentwell Hall is the grandest of all, with a facade in the gothic style from the mid-1500s, but interiors that go back to the 11th century. You can have a good look around inside, but there are also wondrous gardens and a rare breeds farm for kids. The Holy Trinity Church was financed by wool merchants, which explains its extravagance and scale, and its often rated among the most beautiful in the country. The nave is the longest of any parish church in England and nearly all of the traceried windows contain their original medieval glass. "
Felixstowe,"There are two sides to Felixstowe, and the difference between them is night and day. In the south is the largest container port in the UK, receiving 3,000 gigantic cargo ships a year on a headland guarding the Stour Estuary. It&#8217;s an eye-opener to see such the port and its traffic in action. Landguard Fort on the headland is run by English Heritage and was in use from the 16th century all the way up to the Second World War. And then as you travel north, the docks give way to pebble beaches and an Edwardian coastal town. Felixstowe Pier has the requisite amusement arcade and the foreshore is a sequence of pretty gardens landscaped at the turn of the 20th century. "
Flatford Mill,"The south of Suffolk, around the Dedham Vale Area of Natural Beauty is marketed as Constable Country. East Bergholt was the birthplace of John Constable, one of England&#8217;s most-celebrated artists who painted the local pastoral landscapes in his romantic style in the early-1800s. Close by is Flatford Mill, an 18th-century watermill which was owned by Constable&#8217;s father and was the subject of many of his paintings, most famously Flatford Mill (Scene on a Navigable River), which is hanging at the Tate Britain in London. The mill and its thatched cottage are now managed by the National Trust, and hold an exhibition about the artist. "
Lowestoft,"The UK&#8217;s easternmost settlement is a seaside town that makes for a fun day trip in summer, especially if you have children. There are more than enough high-quality attractions to entertain littler holidaymakers for a day or two: Africa Alive! is a conservation-oriented zoo with giraffes, zebras, water buffalo and lemurs. While the amusement park, Pleasurewood Hills, despite being on the small side, is always adding new attractions and rides. The beach to the south of Claremont Pier is a perennial Blue Flag winner, with immaculate sands and long promenade behind. For entertainment and culture there&#8217;s the Victorian Marina Theatre, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has a residency, or the Lowestoft Maritime Museum, which dips into the town&#8217;s seafaring past and former fishing industry. "
Sudbury,"East of the Dedham Vale, Sudbury is a historic market town on the River Stour. Sudbury was the birthplace of Thomas Gainsborough, England&#8217;s pre-eminent portrait painter of the mid-18th century. Gainsborough&#8217;s beautiful house is preserved as a museum for the artist, with a number of his works and information about his early years in the town. In the countryside the Stour is implausibly pretty, nourishing water meadows that you can reach along the Valley Walk, which is both a footpath and cycle route. Boat trips on the Stour are a tranquil way to pass a sunny afternoon, taking you past banks with grazing cattle and the tower of Sudbury&#8217;s All Saints Church in the background. "
Woodbridge,"In 1939 at Sutton Hoo, archaeologists discovered the most important Saxon site in England. It consisted of a 30-metre burial ship, most likely for the 7th-century King Rædwald, and treasures that changed people&#8217;s conceptions of Saxon workmanship. The exhibition hall at Sutton Hoo has reconstructed the burial chamber and gives you fresh insights about the Saxons in East Anglia. Of course there&#8217;s more to the lovely town of Woodbridge, which has been a maritime centre for hundreds of years and has a traditional harbour on the River Deben. Here, clad with white weatherboarding, is the Woodbridge Tide Mill, which is 800 years old and continues to grind flour. "
Framlingham Castle,"This market town often polls as one of the most liveable places in the county, but it also has huge historical importance: Framlingham Castle was constructed in the 1100s and was the seat of some of England&#8217;s most powerful families. All kinds of political intrigue and plots have been hatched at this spot. One momentous event was Mary Tudor retreating here in 1553 after the death of Henry VIII and summoning an army to march on London and take the throne. The castle is in fantastic condition and you can walk along the battlements for inspiring views. Spare some time for the Church of St Michael, recognised for its Thamar Organ, one of just a handful in England to survive the Civil War in the 17th century. "
Orford Castle,"On the River Alde, which weaves through a coastal wetland region on the way to the north sea, Orford is a small town with a maritime character and a whiff of brine. Orford Ness is protected as a nature reserve and adored by boaters, especially on clear days when the whole landscape glistens in the sun. There&#8217;s a quaint old quay by the water, the sort of place that has a pub called &#8220;The Jolly Sailor&#8221;. You can catch a ferry across the river to the wetlands or go for crisp walks on the beach. Orford Castle gazes out over the Ness and was ordered by Henry II in the 12th century to firm up the royal power base in the area. The keep is in excellent condition and has a very unusual appearance, possibly inspired by medieval Byzantine architecture. "
Aldeburgh,"A coastal town with a blue flag pebble beach, Aldeburgh is oriented towards visitors, but it would be wrong to call this unspoiled place a seaside resort. Aldeburgh has little in common with classic English seaside destinations, and is instead more of a historic village by the sea. In Tudor times Aldeburgh was a busy port and there are quite a few structures from this period. See the 16th-century Moot Hall, a kind of town meeting hall which now houses Aldeburgh&#8217;s museum. The Red House is another delightful period property, where the 20th-century composer Benjamin Britten lived. Finally, Aldeburgh has a reputation for its fish and chips, claiming two of the best shops in the country. "
"Clare, Suffolk","Like the best of Suffolk&#8217;s Wool Towns, Clare is just a small settlement now, but its high status in former times lends it tons of personality. Indeed, there are 133 listed buildings in the town, a large amount of which are from the 1500s or older.

You’ll also find Fort Nieuw Amsterdam, where you’ll discover artefacts left from the slave trade as well as Dutch engineered locks that hold back the river.  Other places worth visiting include Peperpot Nature Park and Meerzorg bridge (popular with bird watchers). "
Brownsberg Nature Park,Roughly 80 miles from Paramaribo you’ll find the Brownsberg Nature Park.  It’s 500 metres above sea level and was established in 1969.  It’s mostly neotropical rainforest and is home to hundreds of unique and rare plant and animal species.  You’ll enjoy a day of hiking through this wonderful stretch of nature. 
Jodensavanne,"Just south of Paramaribo, on the Suriname River, is Joden Savanne, or Jews’ savannah. Established in the 17th century, it was originally an agricultural community that was developed by Spanish Jews fleeing persecution.  Sugarcane plantations were the main crop and slaves were used here for a long time.  From the beginning, the community faced difficulties from nearby sugar beet plantations They also dealt with disease, revolts by indigenous people, and heavy taxation.  Eventually the community relocated to Para.  You can visit the ruins of the first synagogue in the Western Hemisphere as well as the old gravesites there. "
Arya Dewaker,"This Hindu temple is the largest in Suriname and is located in Paramaribo. It’s arguably the most important in the country to the 30,000+ Hindu’s who live there.   Designed by a Dutch architect, the building is a two-story octagonal building with meeting rooms, a library, and ceremony room. Everything in the temple is designed to reflect aspects of the sun and though there are no images of deities, you’ll find plenty of Sanskrit and Hindi symbolism. The architect works to combine the Dutch style with the ancient Moghul style from India, as well as a bit of Moorish design.  The result it truly unique. "
"Presidential Palace, Paramaribo","Located in the capital across from Independence Square, the presidential palace is one of the best examples of Dutch colonial architecture in Suriname.  Part of the inner city’s UNESCO World Heritage designation, it was built in the 18th century, and is still the presidents home.  Most commonly used for diplomatic events thanks to the Garden of Palms attached to the property. This palm tree landscape has a wide variety of trees as well the capuchin monkeys and many tropical birds. "
Synagogue and Mosque,"The largest Mosque in the Caribbean is Mosque Keizerstraat, located in Paramaribo.  It is a beautiful building with stunning gardens around it. No machinery was used during construction and thus it took 20 years to complete.  Not only is it an impressive place of worship it’s unique because of its next door neighbour, the Nevah Shalom Synagogue.  Built in the 19th century it has a sandy floor as a symbol of the Hebrews 40 years in the desert. Locals take great pride in the location of these two places of worship and feel it’s a reflection of their multi-ethnicity community. "
St Peter and St Paul Cathedral,"Another part of Para’s UNESCO World Heritage site is the Roman Catholic St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.  It’s the largest wooden building in the Western Hemisphere and was built in the 19th century. The exterior of the cathedral has long intrigued visitors.  Painted grey and yellow, no one seems to know the exact reasons behind the colour scheme.  In 2015 Pope Francis designated it as a minor basilica. "
Onafhankelijkheidsplein,"Also known as Independence Square, Onafhankelijkheidsplein, is home to some of the most important buildings in Suriname:  the colonial government buildings as well at the stately presidential palace.  In many ways, it’s an average square which is perfect for an afternoon nap or a picnic lunch, you also might be lucky enough to stumble upon a signing bird competition. The birds, known as twatwa, are popular in Suriname and enthusiasts like to bring them together to compete.  Don’t look to understand how the winner is chosen; the mystery is part of the fun. "
Central Market,"As far as markets go, this one is fairly intense.  This frenzied area in the inner city sells fish, meats, vegetables, and fruits, just like any other market and upstairs you’ll find a clothes bazaar.  But this market also has a “Witches Market.” Also known as the Maroon Market, there is a separate entrance on Waterkant.  Here you can buy shells, bones, herbs, and various mystery concoctions.  If you want to come out of this frantic area intact, it’s best to go before noon. "
Colakreek,"Just outside of the city you’ll find a phenomenal savannah white-sand forest, a jungle full of wildlife, and cold streams where the clean water runs black thanks to the fallen leaves.   You can see saki monkeys, giant anteaters, tamarins, and a large number of exotic birds (maybe you&#8217;ll even spot a sloth).  If you really want to leave the city behind for a bit, you can camp near Colakreek for a few days while you explore the forest and savannah. "
Mariënburg,"Founded in the 18th century as a sugar cane plantation, Mariënburg now has a production factory on site and is primarily a tourist attraction.  The first railroad in Suriname was built to bring the sugarcane from the village into the city and you can still travel by train to get there.  It’s a good way to see the country and a fun day excursion from Para. "
Dorking,"This market town is in the Surrey Hills and has rambling country estates all around. There are six manor houses minutes from Dorking, all built in the Georgian and Victorian periods and intended to make the most of the beautiful views afforded by the area&#8217;s lush chalk downs. These hills are covered with yew forest and fields scattered with wildflowers in early-summer. Box Hill at 224 metres was where the road cycling race took place for the 2012 Olympics, and offers one of southern England&#8217;s most joyous rural panoramas. Dorking is also known for rearing the Dorking Cockerel, noted for its extra toe, and at the local heritage centre there&#8217;s a informative little section on this breed. "
"St Andrew&#8217;s Church, Farnham","With the sublime green hills of the North Downs, beautiful streets with Georgian houses and a solemn medieval castle, the market town of Farnham has a bit of everything. There has been a market in Farnham since the 12th century when William the Conqueror&#8217;s grandson ordered the motte and bailey Farnham Castle as a seat for the archbishops of Winchester. They remained here for the next eight centuries, while there&#8217;s still a first-class farmers&#8217; market on the fourth Sunday of every month. Volunteers provide free tours of the castle, which has the circular outline of a &#8220;shell-keep&#8221;,  while you&#8217;ll also want to dawdle around the town for a pleasant afternoon. Castle Street, lined with stately Georgian townhouses, is just gorgeous. "
Guildford,"With masses of culture and heritage, Guildford came to prominence because it was equidistant to the naval base at Portsmouth and the admiralty in Greenwich. Travellers riding between the two would stay the night at this staging post, and a couple of the inns for this purpose are still here. On High Street see the Angel Inn, which retains its old signage and is still a working hotel, containing building work from the 1300s. High Street, laid with cobblestones, is crammed with historical buildings like the Guildhall, erected in the 1300s and with a clock that projects over the street from the 1600s. Minutes from the town centre are country estates like Polesden Lacey, Hatchlands Park and Loseley House , and there are more minor attractions than we can do justice to in one paragraph. "
"Charterhouse School, Godalming","Surrey&#8217;s reputation as one of the poshest counties in the UK is anchored in towns like Godalming on the south bank of the River Wey. Minutes away is the exclusive Charterhouse, one of England&#8217;s original &#8220;Public Schools&#8221;. On the high street you&#8217;ll get an idea of the great age of the town, particularly at the market square, bounded by Tudor timber-framed houses. At the centre is the Pepperpot, Godalming&#8217;s former town hall, built in 1814 and arcaded to create a cute covered marketplace. In the 17th century the Wey was dredged and fitted with locks to make it navigable to barges. And that&#8217;s still the case today, with handsome old longboats tied to the wharfs on the north side of the town. "
Weybridge,"Here&#8217;s your destination if you want to venture out and see more of the bucolic River Wey. Starting next to the train station in Weybridge is the Locks and Levels trail, a light walking route on the towpath of the river, with locks and other 17th and 18th-century infrastructure to add some historical interest. And like Farnham Weybridge benefits from lots of Victorian and  Georgian properties, imbuing the centre with period character. Still, your main motive for coming should be to see the Brooklands Racing Circuit, dating to 1907 and so the first track built specifically for car racing in the world. Brooklands was also an aerodrome, and so the track&#8217;s excellent museum has both majestic vintage race cars like a Napier-Railton, and a wonderful aircraft collection including a real Concorde. "
Oxted,"Another exceptionally wealthy town, Oxted&#8217;s fortunes changed in the late-19th century when the railway line put it little more than half an hour from central London. But there had been a town here for many centuries before that, as Oxted was mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was the property of Eustace II of Boulogne, a close friend of William the Conqueror. For  something special, book a tour of Titsey Place, which has paintings by Caravaggio inside and exquisitely manicured grounds with a lake, greenhouses and a lovely walled garden. There are stables providing one-off horseback rides and  superb local amenities like the Barn Theatre, staging Shakespeare plays in a restored 13th-century barn. "
Leatherhead,"An engaging town in the sumptuous countryside of the Surrey Hills, Leatherhead is littered with old properties. The town can provide you with a heritage trail leaflet to direct you to the most significant. There couldn&#8217;t be a more appropriate setting for Leatherhead&#8217;s town museum than the rustic Hampton Cottage, which is an evocative wattle and daub cottage that dates to the 1600s. There are intriguing finds from Anglo Saxon and Roman sites close by, as well as more recent artefacts from the factories that used to be based outside the town (vintage &#8220;Goblin&#8221; brand home appliances and gas lamps). "
Chertsey Bridge,"Families with bored youngsters should keep Thorpe Park in mind. It&#8217;s the second most-visited theme park in the country and is aimed specifically at teenagers and young adults, laying on all sorts of white knuckle rollercoasters and flat rides. The town is also on the Thames and crosses the river at Chertsey Bridge, which was reconstructed by the feted Georgian architect James Paine in 1784. In summer you could take a cruise on this quieter and narrower stretch of the Thames and on Sundays bring little ones for a brief trip on the Great Cockrow Railway, a 50-year-old miniature rail made and preserved with a lots of love. "
Epsom,"Even those who know nothing about horse racing, like us, may be aware that Epsom Downs is the home of the Derby race, which has been run since 1780, placing it among the oldest sporting events in the world. The Derby runs on the first Saturday of June and is the most valuable event on the racing calendar in the UK. In the town the Playhouse Theatre is a well-regarded little venue, with something on almost every night, be it a touring comedian or band. The kids&#8217; attraction, Hobbledown is a sort of animal farm with a Tolkien-esque fantasy style in Horton Country Park. There are llamas, alpacas, meerkats, otters, sheep, pygmy goats, pigs, and lots more for children to meet and pet. "
"Tunnel Road Sand Caves and Mines, Reigate","Right in the inspiring countryside of the North Downs, Reigate is an affluent town with a rural feel even though it&#8217;s in touch with Greater London. Amble along Reigate&#8217;s High Street, which has locally-owned shops in Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings, and a traditional covered market. The terrain gets almost precipitous just behind the high street, and atop this hill is where Reigate&#8217;s Norman castle used to be. Now it&#8217;s a pristine little park guarded by an 18th-century folly resembling a medieval gatehouse. Hewn from the soft chalk underneath these gardens is a walkable former road tunnel constructed in 1823 and claimed to be the oldest in Europe. "
Founders Building &#8211; Royal Holloway College &#8211; Egham,"Brushing the northern edge of Egham is the Runnymede water meadow, where the Magna Carta was sealed between King John I and the barons that had rebelled against him. The charter granted a number of rights to these barons, including protection from illegal imprisonment and is held as a pioneering constitutional document. There&#8217;s a National Trust monument at the site, chosen because it was so close to Windsor that King John could come here and get back quickly and safely during what was a time of war. For a moment of reflection also visit a monument to JFK by the river, at the top of 50 steps, each representing a different state. "
Haslemere,"Surrey&#8217;s southernmost town shelters in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the upper limit of the South Downs National Park. On Petworth Road and the high street you&#8217;ll be left in no doubt that Haslemere is an upmarket sort of town replete with Georgian townhouses and adorable tile-clad cottages. You may be taken aback by the extent of Haslemere Educational Museum&#8217;s collections, which mostly cover natural history (most of all fossils) which were assembled in the 19th century by the prominent surgeon Sir Jonathan Hutchison. And the natural amphitheatre, the Devil&#8217;s Punch Bowl, is minutes uphill from Haslemere and praised as one of the South&#8217;s natural wonders. "
Virginia Water,"The little and typically well-heeled town of Virginia Water is named for the lake on its western edge, which is part of the 2020-hectare Windsor Great Park. Virginia Water&#8217;s magic lies in these stunning surroundings and the luxury amenities and interesting pieces of heritage that come from being next to a royal estate. Wentworth Golf Club is world-renowned, and was the venue for the first ever Ryder Cup. And then there&#8217;s the lake and its 4.5-mile perimeter footpath. These waters have been a shooting location for Harry Potter films, and on the shore are compelling old monuments like an obelisk erected during the reign of George II in the mid-1700s. "
"Saint George&#8217;s Church, Esher","Although a southwest London suburb, Esher falls under the County of Surrey and despite being a low-key place is dotted with Grade-I listed sites. One is the Church of St George, which was built in the 1500s and welcomed worshippers like Queen Victoria. Unlike many English churches St George&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t updated in the 1800s, so keeps its Tudor fittings and character. Claremont House and its gardens also have Grade I status and were bought by Britain for Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Belgium in 1816. The gardens, owned by the National Trust, still have the same layout they had in the 1720s. "
"Shere, Surrey","Ask most people to picture an archetypal southern English village, and what they have in mind will be pretty close to what will meet you in Shere. Think, country pubs with benches out front, a Norman church, a chuckling stream, a tea room and timber-framed houses that hint at old trades like a wheelwright and blacksmith forge. You won&#8217;t be able to resist a wander, and the village has set up a trail to let you know what some of the village&#8217;s buildings used to be. After a pub lunch you could go up to Newlands Corner, a wondrous lookout at 173 metres, where the chalk North Downs roll out before you. "
Hlane Royal National Park,"In truth, there&#8217;s simply no other wildlife reserve in all of Swaziland that can live up to the sheer wealth of bucket-list sights and the mind-boggling biodiversity that Hlane has. After all, this is the only (repeat: only) place in the nation where it&#8217;s possible to track down a lion (which have recently been repatriated), an elephant, and a rhino, all in the same day &#8211; that&#8217;s three of the Big Five! What&#8217;s more, the safari expereince here is well-developed, with rustic campsites next to more built-up lodges. There&#8217;s also a well-maintained network of game paths, all offering great viewing between the knobthorn forests and the savannahs. "
Lobamba,"For all intents and purposes, little Lobamba in the hills is the capital of Swaziland. Actually, it kind of shares the title with Mbabane down the valley, but it&#8217;s here that travelers will discover all the machinery of state: the beautiful Lozitha Palace, home to the Queen Mother; the Swaziland Parliament; the honorific memorials to the country&#8217;s independence hero, King Sobhuza II. And if you&#8217;re still searching for something to do, make a beeline for the informative National Museum of Swaziland, where the collections reveal stories of the British colonial age, and one colourful head of the Indian god Krishna tells of trading tales with the subcontinent across the Arabian Sea. "
Mbuluzi Game Reserve,"Step over the snapping crocodiles of the Mlawula River, located in the extreme north-eastern reaches of Swaziland, and it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll find yourself in the acclaimed Mbuluzi Game Reserve. There are certainly fewer safari crowds here, due mainly to the absence of any of the so-called Big Five. However, that just makes it easier to spot a roaming giraffe or herd of zebra on the plains. What&#8217;s more, it also means a peaceful vibe; one that adds a real air of naturalism and wildness for those stays in the bush. Mbuluzi has both campsites and family lodges for travelers with kids in tow. "
Mbabane,"A mere 95,000 people call Mbabane home, which should give you just a clue as to how large Swaziland is as a whole! After all, this town of low-rise bungalows and palm-dotted streets is the official capital, even if it&#8217;s sat more than 1,200 meters up in the Mdzimba Mountains. The altitude is great for avoiding the scorching heat of the tropical plains below though, while the heritage and cultural attractions here are pretty good too. Check out the endless bazaars and emporiums of the Swazi Maket, where wicker creations and soapstone whittlings meet fresh veg and fruit. Oh, and don&#8217;t miss the views from drive-able Piggs Peak to the north. "
Malolotja Nature Reserve,"Wax up the walking boots and prep those thigh muscles, because the Malolotja Nature Reserve is hailed as one of the hiking meccas of southern Africa. Ranging from the grass-topped highveld to montane forests, the region is home to the rugged rises of the Ngwenya Mountain (the second-highest in the country). It&#8217;s famed for its endless trails of trekking routes, which pierce deep into the wilderness and offer encounters with wildebeest and bucks, cheetahs and grazing bushpigs as they go. Try to come in Spring or Autumn – summer here means rain, and winter can even see frost caking the ridges. "
Mlilwane Reserve,"Right on the doorstep of the Mlilwane Reserve, the pint-sized town of Malkerns is a great place to while away a couple of days in the shadow of the eastern Swaziland mountains. Encompassed by swaying fields of corn and other crops, the center here boasts a lovely clutch of earthy Swazi homestays, not to mention a range of country pubs (that&#8217;s the English influence, no doubt!). However, it&#8217;s the immersive craft stalls and traditional arts centers here that really take the biscuit. You&#8217;ll be able to buy everything from woodworks to handmade candles. "
Mantenga Village,"Once upon a time, the beautiful areas around the village of Mantenga were known simply for their waterfalls, which – to be fair – are amongst some of the most awesome in the country. However, in more recent years, the spotlight has shifted to include the cultural experiences offered by the Mantenga Village too. It&#8217;s the place to go if you want to encounter the Swazi people and learn all about their rich heritage; if you want to see the famous reed dances in action, or want to witness the age-old style of hamlet construction used by the tribal folk here. And of course, the waterfalls are still close by for that end of the day activity! "
Piggs Peak,"Accessible Piggs Peak represents the heartland of the old Swaziland gold rush. Set in-between the hills of the north, it once attracted miners and prospectors of all types, who came to dig in the shafts around the town. Unfortunately, the mineral wealth never really materialised, and the gold faces of Piggs Peak were closed down less than 70 years after opening. Today, the spot has great hiking, some interesting craft markets, and nice homestays. And it&#8217;s the perfect stopover for travelers making their way through to Kruger National Park, located just across the border in South Africa. "
Big Bend,"One of the main urban centers on the meanders of the Maputo River, appropriately-named Big Bend (the town does actually occupy a big bend on the water) has been a center for Swaziland&#8217;s important sugarcane farming industry for decades. It&#8217;s a charming place, with a clutch of shops and inns, but the setting is what really counts. In the distance, the grass plains and agricultural land give way to the rugged rises of the Lubombo Mountains. Small eco lodges hide in the hills nearby, walking paths beckon as they delve into the deep-cut gorges and canyons to the east, and the green lawns of the Mhlosinga Nature Reserve are also on the menu. "
Manzini,"Once, this bustling industrial depot in the highlands of central Swaziland bore the name of explorer Arthur Bremer, who was one of the first colonial figures to designate this cool and temperate place an official trading post way back when. Today, the city hasn&#8217;t shed its mercantile character, and it continues to reign as perhaps the most important economic powerhouse in the nation. There are business hotels, trade fairs, and the Matsapha International Airport is just a stone&#8217;s throw away. It&#8217;s hardly a wonder that locals endearingly refer to the bustling spot as simply, &#8216;The Hub&#8217;! "
Sibebe,"Sibebe isn&#8217;t a town, or a city. It&#8217;s not a nature reserve, or some awesome man-made attraction. However, it is a rock. And it&#8217;s a darn large rock at that! Yep, the colossal dome that is the Sibebe Rock is the largest granite pluton in the world. It sits just 10 kilometers away from the capital city at Mbabane, making it both accessible and unusual. Tourists and locals alike love to climb the great monolith, which can be done on a whole host of different trails. The hardest, hailed by many as the steepest incline trekking path in the world, is a real challenge, while some others are light and easy-going, offering beautiful views over the eastern mountains of Swaziland as they wind to the summit. "
Mkhaya Game Reserve,"The place to stalk the lowveld plains of Swaziland&#8217;s eastern haunch, the Mkhaya Game Reserve is a world peppered with acacias and trodden by galumphing great black rhinos. It&#8217;s famed as one of the best bargain safari destinations in the region, offering affordable lodges and both jeep and walking game encounters as part of affordable packages. Ecotourists who come here can stake out the riparian lands for giraffes, elephants, hippos and crocs, and learn all about the important poaching patrols that Mkhaya is known for. "
Simunye,"Cast out on the lowveld plains that begin to bubble up and into the Lubombo Mountains to the west, Simunye is a prime example of a corporation town. The population of just under 6,000 is entirely employed by the Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation, which runs the great sugar mills and plantations that make their home here. For international tourists, the town is also located super close to the acclaimed reserves of the Hlane National Park, has its very own protected area (the Simunye Nature Reserve), and comes with a pool-dotted country club serving international food. "
Nhlangano,"It’s just a short drive from the Mahamba border posts with South Africa to the town of Nhlangano, which is officially the fourth-largest in Swaziland. Peppered with pretty jacaranda trees, the place is a chilled regional hub, with good transport links to the safari destinations of the lowveld deeper into the country. However, if you chose to linger, you&#8217;ll be able to see the spot where King George VI once thanked King Sobhuza II for his country&#8217;s contribution to the war, and explore the high-perched hamlet of Hlathikhulu, set magnificently above the gorgeous valleys of western Swaziland. "
Stockholm,"Stockholm is widely said to be one of the most picturesque and user friendly cities in Europe, and has an abundance of clean air that blows in off the Baltic Sea, as well as wide open spaces, woodlands, and parks. There is also a strong dedication to history in Stockholm that can be felt when you venture to the old town centre of Gamla Stan where you will find historic buildings as well as dainty cobbled streets that wind around the island and give visitors the chance to explore on foot. For some maritime history, head down to the harbor to see the Vasa, a warship that dates from the 17th century and escaped a watery end after being preserved and restored. Make the most of Sweden’s open green spaces with a trip to the central park of Kungsträdgården where locals go to relax and enjoy the splendid scenery. "
Ystad,"Perhaps best known for the books and films based in the area that chart the story of fictional detective Kurt Wallander, and written by Swedish author Henning Mankell, Ystad doesn’t disappoint in real life for those who have only experienced it on paper. The city now offers tours for fans of the books who can visit areas mentioned in the famous tomes, or you can choose to explore on your own, and take in the amazing architecture of the region firsthand. Many of the buildings here are made from wood giving Ystad an old world feel, and there are quaint cafes, eateries, and boutiques to uncover as you wander around this picturesque town. "
Marstrand,"The city of Marstrand on the west coast is probably about as glitzy as it gets in Sweden, and is known as something of a French Riviera style setting where, historically, royalty and films stars have come to get away from it all. The area is also very popular as a sailing destination so if you want to get out on the glassy Baltic water then this is the place to visit. One of the best ways to take in the city is to climb to the top of Carlsten Fortress from which you can stare out across the water and take in the natural wonders that Sweden has in spades. Marstrand is also famous for its spas which are legendary in Sweden, so pamper yourself with some Swedish massage if you want to get the full opulent experience that draws the rich and famous to this city. "
Vadstena,"From its home beside a lake, Vadstena was a place of great importance to the royal family of Sweden, and relics of this era remain including the imposing Vadstena Castle that dates from the 16th century and comes complete with an old school moat to protect the royals within. Vadstena is also known for its monastic relics, including a stunning abbey that was built in the 14th century by the first female saint of Sweden. There are other places of historical and religious importance dotted around the city, and there is a strong calming and romantic atmosphere here, with rose covered houses and maze like streets for visitors to explore at their own pace. "
Jönköping,"Come to this picturesque town, which made its fortune manufacturing and selling matchsticks, for a peaceful and calm retreat from the world, and as a jumping off point to go and visit the nearby Lake Vättern, the second largest lake in Sweden, and upon whose shores the town rests. The lake is often said to resemble the shape of a finger and there are beautiful views to be found over the clear and glassy surface. For those feeling energetic, there are nature trails around the lake in order for you to make the most of the outdoor setting and admire the local wildlife and plant life. "
"Kosterhavet, Lighthouse","Boasting the first Marine National Park to be inaugurated in Sweden, Kosterhavet is located over the Koster Islands, and is a paradise for those who enjoy the great outdoors and who want to enjoy the many marine pursuits on offer here. For those looking for adventure there are kayaking and boating opportunities, or you can keep it simple and explore the beaches and rocky terrain that leads you to caves, coves, and outcrops next to the bracing sea. Biking is a common pastime on the islands and you can follow tours of all the places of interest or just go it alone. As you are by the sea, there is an abundance of fresh seafood to enjoy including locally caught lobster. "
Gothenburg,"Known as the capital of West Sweden, Gothenburg is a charming city filled with cobbled streets that are perfect for roaming around on foot in search of hidden treasures, as well as parks and outdoor spaces, including the Botanical Gardens that will teach you all about indigenous plants and animals. The city also boasts a wealth of local markets if you fancy trying some of the local produce, or you can dine in one of the upscale restaurants that are putting Swedish food on the culinary map thanks to the number of Michelin starred eateries in Gothenburg. The city also has a great cafe culture if you want to try the local coffee and Swedish pastries like sweet buns and watch the world go by. "
Visby,"Said to date back to the Middle Ages, Visby is a port and was once a place of great trade importance leading to a protective wall, named the Ringmuren, being built to protect the city from marauders, and this still stands today along with other historical relics in the city that have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As well as being a historical gem in Sweden’s crown, Visby is well known on the arts scene, as many famous Swedish artists have chosen to call the port home thanks to its stunning light, and if you visit during the summer months you can tour many of the artists’ homes and studios which are open to visitors, usually in June. "
Stockholm Archipelago,"Sweden is hardly a frenetic country, but if you still find that you want to get out of the bigger cities and take things even slower, then you can head out to one or several of the 30,000 islands that exist in the Stockholm archipelago. One of the best ways to get around and witness the stunning and rugged islands is to take one of the old steam boats that still operate in the region. Many have planned day tours with meals included or you can charter a private boat and island hop to your heart’s content, taking in the wild scenery and private atmosphere, as only around 1,000 of the islands in the archipelago are actually inhabited. "
Malmö,"Known for being the biggest city in the county of Skåne, Malmö has steadily been making a name for itself in recent years as an arts and cultural hub in Sweden. Alongside many eclectic and up and coming new galleries, this city also has a strong commitment to ecological causes and fair-trade products, having been made the first Fair-trade City in the country. Many of the restaurants here have a farm-to-table philosophy with an emphasis on organic produce and ingredients, so any serious foodies should not miss the fine dining on offer here. There is also an emerging nightlife scene in Malmö with many venues providing live music or other pop up events. "
Jukkasjärvi,"If you enjoy winter then you really should consider visiting the ICEHOTEL in Jukkasjärv, which holds the title as the largest hotel in the world to be constructed from snow and ice. The hotel usually stands from approximately December-March, after which it becomes too warm for the hotel to be sustainable and so it is left to melt, so if you want to check it out or just go for a drink at the ice bar then you will need to come over the winter period. Aside from the actual hotel location there are a whole host of activities available at the ICEHOTEL such as ice fishing, dog sledging, and excursions into the wilderness on snowmobiles. "
Sundsvall,"Sundsvall is often called ‘Stone City’, as the previous town was razed to the ground in the 1800s due to a fire. To avoid such an occurrence happening again all the fire damaged building were rebuilt using stone instead of wood, and as such this makes for a more unusual sight as opposed to many other traditional Swedish buildings, particularly those on the coast. As such many visitors come to Sundsvall to witness the story and the architecture first hand, and after you have seen the mighty stone houses, there is also a famous museum dedicated to local artists and featuring paintings, sculptures, and art installations. "
Lake Siljan,"The province of Dalarna is well worth a visit for its magnificent ski resorts and the tranquil but mighty Lake Siljan. Located near the border with Norway, Dalarna is made up of forest, meadows, and wide open spaces, and many of the towns in the province are to be found lakeside, with favorites for travelers both domestic and international being the towns of Mora or Leksand. If you fancy some winter fun then the resort of Idre, set in the mountains shared by Norway, offers premium skiing and snowboarding, or you can trek in the area on one of the many hiking trails. "
Lake Mälaren,"To the west of Stockholm you will find Lake Mälaren, a vast waterway that is home to Birka Island that sits within the lake and provides a history lesson to anyone interested in the Viking period of Sweden. The lake’s main city is named Västerås and is known as a bustling city that is lined with beaches, that also has a wealth of historical relics that date from the days of the conquering Vikings. You can cruise around the lake by boat or simply hop from one location to the other using the main ferries that service the area. "
Swedish Lapland in Summer,"If you want to take the road less travelled then Swedish Lapland may just be the perfect place to get away from it all. Located in the Arctic Circle, and known as the home of the Sami or indigenous people who live in the area, Swedish Lapland is made up of a clutch of towns as well as forest and wild but picturesque scrubland. Visitors can travel to the northernmost town in Sweden, Kiruna, to visit the adjacent national parks that stud the area and allow visitors to see elk, reindeer, and even bears roaming freely in their natural habitat. Other natural phenomenon to look out for in Swedish Lapland are the midnight sun, when the sun never sets in the summer months, and the Northern Lights. "
Zurich,"Zurich lies on the picturesque shores of Lake Zurich as well as at the base of the Alps, ensuring that wherever you look, you are sure to find beautiful vistas and stunning scenery. Popular activities in Zurich include boating on the lake, or simply strolling along its pristine edges, or you can go for a light hike at Utliberg Mountain. Not just a one hit wonder, Zurich is also a city of culture and there are a plethora of museums to visit such as the Swiss National Museum housed within an alpine style castle. If you are an art lover then this city doesn’t disappoint with over 100 galleries to choose from, or if you prefer shopping then you can make for one or several of the high end boutiques that Zurich is known for and indulge in some retail therapy of famous Swiss brands. "
Lausanne,"Part of the Lake Geneva Region, the town of Lausanne is perhaps most famous for being the base of the International Olympic Committee, who certainly can’t resist its charms, having been housed there since 1914. The old part of the medieval town features a towering Gothic cathedral that is said to be the finest example of its kind in all of Switzerland, and Lausanne also has a quaint city centre for visitors to explore on foot, and as such a vibrant cafe culture where you can relax and watch the world go by. The surrounding area of Lausanne is also simply breathtaking, from Lake Geneva that rests at the base of the town, to the vineyards that grow rampant and provide excellent and ever-flowing wines if you fancy trying some of the local tipple. "
Geneva,"Perhaps most famous for being the home of the United Nations, there is also much more to Geneva than just its humanitarian heart, and although it may be dubbed the ‘Capital of Peace’ by many, the city also has a diverse and exciting undercurrent for visitors to uncover. For those who want to stroll around the city at their leisure, there are chic boutiques, galleries, winding streets, and quaint quays. Also not to be missed on a trip to Geneva is the iconic fountain that erupts from Lake Geneva and launches jets of water up to 500 feet in the air. If you are a culture fiend, then Geneva is home to theatres and opera houses, as well as museums including one dedicated entirely to Switzerland’s famous timepieces. "
Interlaken,"Interlaken, in the Bernese Oberland Region, used to be famous as the centre for watch making in Switzerland, although nowadays it is best known as a nature resort, or a kind of theme park that takes place in the natural world. If you like all things related to the great outdoors then Interlaken won’t disappoint with idyllic mountain railways, cable cars, ski slopes, and hiking trails for those who want to visit in the warmer summer time. If you don’t fancy skiing or hiking, then there are lots of other activities to choose from like paragliding or even wood carving classes available. If you are feeling hungry after a day of exploring outside, then you can try the local delicacy of raclette, which features lots of melted cheese. "
Appenzell,"Come to Appenzell in the Alpstein Region, if you want to learn all about the culture and folk traditions of Switzerland. Positively steeped in local flavor, Appenzell still follows and showcases centuries old traditions such as the annual descent of the cattle in anticipation of the winter months, as well as cultural practices like folk dancing and traditional music, or there is also the Appenzell Museum for those who want to delve into the history of the region even further. Many visitors also come here to hike or climb in the area, and there are rock formations that tower over 2500 meters high. "
Zermatt,"Located close to the magnificent Matterhorn, Zermatt has made a name for itself as the place to go if you enjoy skiing and mountaineering in the winter, or if you just want to go for a hike in the summer months. Whatever time of year you visit, there is a cable car to allow you access to the summit of the neighboring mountains, and you can also travel around the area by scenic mountain trains, 63 of them in fact, that service the area. Skiers in the region can enjoy over 200 miles of slopes that cater to all levels of ability, or if you prefer to walk then there are over 400 kilometers of hiking and nature trails to follow. Zermatt is also famously unpolluted as gasoline run vehicles are not allowed in the town and only cars that run on battery power can access the area. This means that you will get clean air, stunning views, and a range of outdoor activities in what is said to be one of the prettiest towns in the world. "
Bern,"Bern is often said to look much like it must have done 500 years, all sandstone buildings and cobbled stone streets, although the city actually dates back to the 12th century and still has medieval architecture in places to prove it. The city lies in a peninsula of the River Aare and the old town section has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including the waterside promenade that stretches for over four miles. Also of note in Bern is the Zytglogge, a clock tower that features puppets that dance around to the chimes of the clock, as well as the city’s main Gothic style cathedral named the Munster. "
Lucerne,"Nestled on the banks of Lake Lucerne, with the imposing Alps in the background, Lucerne is almost so pretty that it looks like a painting. If you want to get out on the water then you can float around Lake Lucerne on a cruise ship, or you can choose to browse the streets of the old town, now car free, where you will find wooden bridges, dainty town squares, and ornate frescoes. That isn’t to say that Lucerne is stuck in the past however, and you can also catch some of the up and coming cultural events that are being promoted and which make use of the Culture and Convention Centre, a building that is leading the way in modern architecture in the city. If you like to try the local foods, then you can’t miss Luzerner Chügelipastete, a shell made of puff pastry filled with veal, mushrooms, and cream sauce. "
The Matterhorn,"Marking out the basic border between Switzerland and Italy, the Matterhorn is one of a series of mountains that makes up the Alps. It’s also one of the most photographed mountains in the world, perhaps due to its almost perfect pyramid shape, sometimes said to resemble a jagged fang. The Matterhorn used to only be accessible to harden climbers, but now there are cable cars and trains that will take you near to the summit. If you do indeed decide to trek on the Matterhorn, then expect the trip to take 10 days, walking along trails that have been in use for centuries, and passing by natural wonders such as meadows, forests, and glaciers. "
Rhine Falls,"If you venture to the town of Schaffhausen, it may well be in preparation for a trip to the Rhine Falls which are located nearby. Standing tall at 23 meters high, these are the largest plain falls in all of Europe, and you can take a boat trip up the Rhine to near the base of the falls to see them in all their glory. If you fancy getting even closer to the action then you can observe the falls from one of the special viewing platforms that are accessible via stairs built into the mountainside. Visitors can also follow guided tours around the immediate area that culminate in a trip to the Rhine Falls, and there are picnic spots and local restaurants dotted around if you fancy trying some local food as you watch the clouds of billowing spray. "
Engadin St Moritz,"Said to be one of the most clement areas of Switzerland, many visitors come to this region to experience fresh air, stunning lakeside views, and small homey villages that are scattered all over the countryside. If you want to get to know a little more about local rural life in Switzerland then this is the place to come, or you can take in the scenery during a hike in the surrounding mountains. Interestingly, this region of Switzerland is a melting pot of languages with some areas speaking German, French, or even English. "
"Vico Morcote, Ticino","Close to Italy, Ticino has a strong Mediterranean feel, and this is reflected in the fact that it is the only part of Switzerland to speak Italian. Even the flora, fauna, and architecture appear different when you get to Ticino, with warm sun kissed color palettes and even some palm trees. The capital of this area, known as a canton, is the city of Bellinzona, and period features of the old part of this town are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including three castles and the remains of the old fortification wall. Ticino is also famous for the food and drink, with a great love of pasta being another sign that you are close to the border with Italy, as well as an abundance of locally produced wines. "
Basel,"The city of Basel is located between France and Germany, as well as being neatly bisected by the River Rhine, and this geographical mix is reflected in the atmosphere of the city, also the third largest in Switzerland. There is a diversity felt here in the different cultures, architecture, and influences seen in the city, which is well known for its cultural pursuits such as an abundance of art galleries, museums, orchestras, theatres, and the world famous Basel Art Museum. No wonder therefore that Basel is often also called the ‘City of Art’. Aside from the attractions and exhibitions on display, the architecture in Basel is art in itself, as many of the buildings are sculpted from red sandstone, particularly around the town square. "
Lugano,"Lugano is an Italian speaking section of Switzerland, and is said to be increasingly popular with the glitterati thanks to its calm and serene atmosphere and all round air of sophistication. The city is said to date all the way back to the 9th century, and as such you can expect to see a whole host of relics from bygone eras, such as churches, cathedrals, museums, and libraries. Lugano is nestled close to the shores of Lake Lugano, and you can tour the lake on a speedboat if you want the full celebrity effect of a trip to the ‘Monte Carlo of Switzerland’ as it is sometimes teasingly known. "
Jungfrau Region,"Whether you choose to visit during the summer or winter months, you won’t be disappointed with a trip to the Jungfrau Region which has something for visitors to enjoy all year round. In the summer there are miles of hiking trails so that you can check out the local plant and wildlife, or you can go climbing if you prefer something more strenuous. In the winter skiing is a popular pastime in the region, and there are also biking trails for when the terrain allows for you to take to a set of wheels. The Jungfrau Region is made up of four Alpine towns and three mountains, and there is a mountain railway to take you across the region in style. "
Unguja,"Don&#8217;t knock us for ditching the safari parks and picking picture-perfect Unguja (the kingpin of Zanzibar) for the top spot! If only you could see just how aquamarine the waters were here (move over Cote d&#8217;Azur!), how soft the sands; how immersive those Swahili marketplaces, we&#8217;re certain you would have too. Once trodden by sultans and British imperialists, the capital of Stone Town here bursts with coral-stone forts, Persian palaces, and European frontispieces. And then there are the beaches, from seaweed-spattered Kendwa to whiter-than-white Nungwi and its salt-washed bungalows on the shore. Hey, this little isle in the Indian Ocean really did earn its place as the byword for tropical perfection! "
Mount Kilimanjaro National Park,"A reserve that surely needs no introduction, the exotic reaches of the Mount Kilimanjaro National Park have been a symbol of Africa&#8217;s rich biodiversity and eye-popping backcountry since they were first inaugurated by the German colonists back in the 1920s. Today, they magnetise backpackers and intrepid walkers, who flock to strap on the hiking boots and scale the summit of Africa&#8217;s highest peak. There are oodles of options for those eager to get to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, ranging from the easy-going Marangu trek to the panoramic Machame route. On top of that there&#8217;s game viewing to boot, with creatures like the hardy tree hyrax, colobus monkeys and elephants all roaming the wilds. "
Ruaha National Park,"Sprawled out over an area almost exactly the size of Wales, the Ruaha National Park has expanded and expanded over the years to become the single largest game reserve in the entire of East Africa. Today, it ranges more than 20,000 square kilometers over baobab forests, gallery woods and acacia-dotted plains. And despite its size, Ruaha&#8217;s relative inaccessibility ensures there are no booming crowds of safari-goers here. Instead, the game experience is up-close-and-personal, with cheetahs and leopards and wild dogs all part of the action. You can also expect a large elephant population, with estimated numbers putting the population at over 100,000 individuals. "
Ngorongoro Conservation Area,"The Ngorongoro Conservation Area is nothing short of legendary on the safari circuit of East Africa. A huge dustbowl of savannah and fig tree forests, undulating hills of mud-caked plains and dramatic cliffs, it&#8217;s delineated by the colossal caldera of an ancient volcano – the largest of its kind on the planet, in fact. Hidden behind the serrated peaks that make the great crater, the wildlife here has been able to thrive and survive like nowhere else on the continent. You&#8217;ll find rare crater lions and black rhinoceroses, blue wildebeest and the endemic Tanzanian cheetahs, all of which roam the lost hinterland between the peaks. "
Stone Town,"Okay, so historic Stone Town has already had a mention along with picture-perfect tropical Unguja, the Zanzibar island where it makes its home. But this fascinating place is worthy of a listing in its own right too. After all, there&#8217;s really nothing that can live up to its immersive patchwork of Omani forts and arabesque houses, the richly-adorned House of Wonders (once trodden by sultans) and Persian hammams left over from the Arabs. There&#8217;s also an Anglican church that sticks out like sore thumb, and a palpability to the Swahili culture here that&#8217;s not on offer elsewhere in Tanzania. "
Selous Game Reserve,"UNESCO-attested and hailed by loyal safari-goers the world over, the Selous Game Reserve is a real monster of an area. It encompasses no less than 54,000 square kilometers in the heart of south-eastern Tanzania, and boasts a biodiversity to match. There are hippos in the ox-bow lakes, swaying baobab trees, wandering elephants at the mud fords, marauding wild dogs, and Cape buffalos to name just a few of the eye-catching fauna. Come and explore this vast hinterland of miombo woodland and seasonal floodplains along the Rufiji River, and you&#8217;re in for a true experience of the African wilds! "
Lake Tanganyika,"Kigoma is beset by the deep blue waters of Lake Tanganyika, which encompasses the town on three sides. Boats bob around its timber jetties, while larger ships graze against the shores here too. In fact, the town represents one of the major ports on the water, and vessels still ferry passengers all the way from Kigoma to Zambia during the week. The town is known for its ease-of-access to the chimp-dotted forests of the Gombe National Park, the trekking trails of the Mahale Mountains, and for the sandy beaches and lapping waters that make it a great place to kick-back and relax inland. "
Tarangire National Park,"The mixture of scrawny acacia boughs and the colossal outlines of baobab trees make the landscapes of Tarangire National Park ones to remember. They sit on the edge of the northern Crater Highlands of the country, close to Ngorongoro and the sprawling city of Arusha. Crisscrossed by countless herds of wildebeest and zebra, impala and bucks, the area makes for fine game viewing. However, there are two more treats awaiting in the backcountry here worth of remark: the otherworldly termite mounds that pepper the plains, and the large population of wild elephants that can often be seen roaming. "
Arusha,"Shrouded by the chipped and chiselled peak of Mount Meru, the fifth-highest in all of Africa no less, the hubbub of metropolitan Arusha does well to keep communion with nature. It&#8217;s a town that still bears the hallmarks of its founders: the Maasai pastoralists. They come out in the throbbing, colorful markets and bazaars, where prayer beads click and livestock squawks behind the emporiums. There are immersive coffeehouses too, along with oodles of tour operators offering intrepid excursions out to conquer the top of 4,500-meter-high Meru; forever beckoning on the horizon. "
Pemba Island,"As of yet undiscovered Pemba sits out in to the swells of the Indian Ocean, picking up on the tropical beauty front where the white beaches of the Swahili Coast left of on mainland Tanzania. A part of the same island chain as impossibly-beautiful Zanzibar, the spot comes imbued with some of East Africa&#8217;s most colourful coral gardens, each teeming with a kaleidoscope of marine life. However, leave the diving dhows of the coast behind for a moment and go in search of Pemba&#8217;s curious past of voodoo witchcraft and medieval Ndagoni ruins, and you&#8217;re sure not to leave disappointed! "
Mafia Island,"Despite the somewhat unsavoury name of this little jewel in the Indian Ocean, its shimmering white sands and swaying palm tree groves are not the home of any cigar-touting fat cats out of Chicago by way of Sicily. Nope, far from being a Mafioso stronghold, this one is actually a tropical paradise; a part of the Zanzibar Archipelago no less! Shaped like a jutting rhino horn, it&#8217;s surrounded by glowing beaches of alabaster white, and comes fringed with gardens of coral reef where the pygmy hippo sloshes in the water. Unsurprisingly, SCUBA is top of the menu! "
Serengeti National Park,"For many, simply the world Serengeti is synonymous with the iconic wilderness of East Africa; places where the unmistakable outlines of long-necked giraffes drift against the rock-ribbed backdrop of Ngorongoro Conservation Area; where swaying savannah grasses camouflage the stalking leopards, and lazy lion prides recline in the acacias. Serengeti has achieved its fame thanks to the presence of the so-called Big Five game, while luxury lodges mix with eco camps, drawing all sorts of safari goers to its climes. Yep, this one certainly promises to be one to write home about! "
Arusha National Park,"Ranging from the alkaline lakes of Momella to the verdant hillsides of the Ngurdoto Crater, Arusha National Park is a place of such varied habitats and environments that it&#8217;s easy to see why there&#8217;s such a rich biodiversity between its borders. Sat close to the city of the same name in the northern reaches of the nation, it&#8217;s a place where safari goers come to spy curious colobus monkeys in the boughs, or wonder at the moving pink wisps of flamingo flocks against the watering holes. It&#8217;s not as famous as the country&#8217;s other big game sites, but it is off-the-beaten-track and less crowded during the high season. "
Katavi National Park,"The jewel of the Katavi Region of the west is a vast floodplain that reaches out to where the lands give way to Lake Tanganyika on the border with the DRC. It&#8217;s a wonderful destination for game viewers, made popular thanks to the predominance of mudholes and watering spots that appear when the rains hit. Around these croc-infested rivers and pools, you should be able to spy out hippos and zebras, elephants and cheetah. What&#8217;s more, thanks to its far-fling position in the west, Katavi receives just a fraction of the safari goers as Arusha or Serengeti. "
Dar es Salaam,"A whopping four million people call the seemingly endless metropolis of Dar es Salaam their home. It&#8217;s a city that&#8217;s burst from its seams in the last couple of decades, with huge port districts popping up to receive all the cargo vessels from across the Indian Ocean. Today, that mercantile boom has translated into a city of virtually boundless energy and character. Fish markets sprawl around the Kivukoni Front, where the hawkers haggle for fish cuts and seafood. Harbourside depots now dwarf the old church spires that stood here before the big change. Daladala vans purr through the streets. Enjoy the lived-in energy and excellent National Museum before making a beeline for the beautiful beaches and islands along the shore. "
Hobart,"The capital city of Tasmania is nestled among the foothills of Mt Wellington (a stunning mountain that is well worth a visit in its own right). Hobart is best known for the funky, fashionable Salamanca Markets, widely considered Australia’s best outdoor markets. But there’s plenty more to do here: from walking tracks and trails, gorgeous parks and gardens, to fascinating history and delicious cuisine, there’s something here for everyone. The galleries and museums here are particularly renowned, especially MONA (the Museum of Old and New Art). The Battery Point walk is also fascinating: the classic architecture feels like something out of a Victorian storybook, and reminds you that Hobart is indeed Australia’s second oldest city. Additionally, Tasmania&#8217;s Botanical Gardens are particularly gorgeous, and only a short walk from the city centre. But perhaps the most fun you can have here is wandering the inner-city laneways and coming across hidden treasures! "
Winter in Miena,"Miena is a gorgeous lakeside town, and a popular getaway for Hobart-dwellers. Located in the heart of the Central Highlands, the town boasts excellent fishing, spectacular scenery, a relaxing atmosphere and stunning views of the Great Lake, Australia’s second-largest freshwater lake. If you can brave the cold, the snowy Miena winters are quite lovely. It’s also a stone’s throw away from the Central Plateau Conservation Area, aptly nicknamed the Land of a Thousand Lakes, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Tasmania Wilderness site. "
St Helens,"St Helens is the largest town on the North-East Coast, and an excellent place to base yourself while exploring what this area has to offer: the stunning Bay of Fires, Binalong Bay, Georges Bay, Peron Dunes and the St Columba Falls. St Helens is lovely in its own right, with gorgeous sea views, friendly locals and a relaxed atmosphere. As the second largest fishing port in Tasmania, it’s also a great place for casting a line, or eating the freshest and tastiest seafood imaginable! "
Port Arthur,"The small seaside town of Port Arthur is Tasmania’s most popular attraction. One of Australia’s most significant historical sites, the town boasts excellently preserved buildings from the town’s previous incarnation as a convict settlement, and acts as an open-air museum to Australia’s convict past: indeed, Port Arthur is one of several sites that form the UNESCO World Heritage serial-listed Australian Convict Sites. Port Arthur is considered the best-preserved of these sites. From 1833 to 1853, Port Arthur was the destination to which convicts sent to Australia who had reoffended would be sent on to; it was also where rebellious convicts from other sites were relocated to. The Port Arthur penitentiary was an example of the &#8220;Separate Prison Typology”, emerging from the theories of Jeremy Bentham, known for the infamous panopticon. This system also signified a shift from physical to psychological punishment, including extended periods of sensory deprivation. Port Arthur prisoners were also used for hard labor; some of the prisoners used were as young as 9 years old. Those who died in the prison were buried in unmarked graves at the nearby Isle of the Dead. Tourists are attracted to the lovely scenery, but also the fascinating insight into Australia’s history. The town is also known for the many ghost stories surrounding it, and lantern-lit ghost tours are available. There is also a fascinating museum on-site which is well worth a visit. "
Three Capes Track,"Starting with a boat ride outside of the Port Arthur township before commencing on a 46km easy-to-moderate walking trail, the Three Capes Track deserves a mention in its own right: the scenery is breathtaking, with cliffs jutting straight out of the sea, and plenty of marine life such as seals and dolphins. There’s huts on the way so that you can stay the night in comfort, and the track itself is well-maintained. Pick up the information book from the Parks and Wildlife Service so that you can fully understand and enjoy what makes this track so special. "
Little Blue Lake,"The color of this lake is what makes it particularly worth a visit: originally a mining hole, the unusual, vivid aqua-blue color comes from its high mineral content (which is also why swimming is not advised here, but it’s a popular waterskiing spot). You can also make this your starting point for a hike up Mt Cameron, or make your way on to Mt William National Park. "
Devonport Lighthouse,"Devonport lies at the northern tip of Tasmania, and is the main population centre in the region. It is known for its lovely views of the Mersey River, its gorgeous arboretum, the Mersey Bluff lighthouse, and being the northern starting point of the 480 km Tasmanian Trail. It is also the home of the oldest Aboriginal museum in Australia, Tiagarra, which offers a fascinating insight into the many Aboriginal sites in the area, including ancient art, as well as the Tiagarra walking track. "
Wineglass Bay,"These two bays are perhaps the most spectacular scenery that Tasmania has to offer, and are also a great place to do some water sports, bushwalking, rock climbing or fishing. These bays are iconic Tasmania, and a much-loved holiday destination by locals and tourists alike. Accommodation in the area ranges from budget to luxury, so a perfect for romantic getaways or shoestring tourism alike. "
Narawntapu National Park,"This national park boasts diverse scenery, flora and fauna, with low coastal ranges, Bass Strait beaches, lagoons, dunes and wetlands. Nicknamed the “Serengeti of Tasmania”, it’s a wonderful place to view Australian native wildlife in their natural habitat: you won’t have to wait long to spot a wombat, a wallaby or a roo! Platypuses and echidnas also inhabit the park, as well as a wide variety of birdlife, and even three species of bats. "
Tarkine Wilderness Area,"The Tarkine is a 447,000 hectare tract of temperate rainforest, containing pine, leatherwood and myrtle trees. It is also home to many Aboriginal heritage sites, and teeming with animal life, including several rare and threatened species. The Tarkine is a wonderfully calming, gorgeous and serene place to visit; especially in the Forest Reserve, it’s easy to forget about civilization entirely as you enjoy an adventure into natural, unspoiled beauty. Some highlights of the Tarkine are the Philosopher Falls, the Wee Georgie Wood Steam Railway, and a river cruise of the Pieman River. "
Zoodoo Zoo,"Half an hour from Hobart, the adorably-named Zoodoo Zoo has all manner of local and exotic animals, and opportunities to get up close and personal: on the safari bus tour, you can hand-feed camels and zebras, and during the animal presentations, you can even feed a lion! You can also enjoy the Encounters on offer with animals such as friendly meerkats and marmosets. This is also a perfect spot to see the famous Tasmanian Devil, which is a fun experience for wildlife-lovers and Looney Tunes fans alike. While you’re in the area, make sure to spend some time enjoying the local town, Richmond: famous for its gorgeous bridge, Georgian architecture and the Hobart Town Historical Model Village. "
"King Island, Australia","King Island is an island in the Bass Strait, between the Australian mainland state of Victoria, and Tasmania’s North West Coast. The island is particularly famous for its culinary delights: cheeses beloved throughout Australia, premium beef, and divine crayfish. The snowy-white beaches are a little bit of paradise, and there’s plenty of fascinating flora and fauna to enjoy as well. The island is also known for its three lighthouses, including Australia’s tallest, the 48-metre Cape Wickham Lighthouse. (Tasmania’s waters are known as some of the world’s choppiest, with over 1000 recorded shipwrecks, so the lighthouse keepers would have had plenty of work to do!) You can also enjoy a splendid golf course, fishing, or one of the many guided tours of the island that will introduce you to its fascinating history. "
Overland Track,"This track is not for the faint-hearted (temperatures change rapidly, and deaths have occurred), but if you have a good level of fitness, then this remote alpine walk is an iconic Australian experience, and considered one of the world’s best bushwalks. The 65km, six-day trek through the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park spans from Ronny Creek in Cradle Valley (next to Cradle Mountain) to the north, and Australia’s deepest lake &#8211; Lake St Clair &#8211; to the south. You’ll be able to understand why UNESCO has registered some of this track as part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area: with stunning views of rainforests, eucalypt forest, meadows and valleys, and the potential for side trips to breathtaking waterfalls, the diverse scenery makes for a uniquely memorable experience. "
Deloraine,"Deloraine is a picturesque riverside town in the foothills of the Great Western Tiers mountain range, with a lovely historical Georgian and Victorian streetscape and a fascinating arts and crafts culture: as well as many local galleries, antique and craft shops, Deloraine also hosts the largest craft fair in the country. The food here is also excellent: the town is particularly known for its raspberries, cheese and salmon. While the town is lovely in its own right, it’s also a perfect base to explore further afield: Cradle Mountain, the Great Western Tiers, Central Highlands and Mole Creek Karst National Park are all easily accessible from Deloraine. "
Cradle Mountain,"Cradle Mountain is an iconic Tasmanian destination: Tasmania’s fifth-highest mountain rises around the crystal-clear blue waters of Dove Lake, making for spectacular lake and mountain views. The whole area is rich in flora, fauna and unusually diverse fungi. There’s a 6-7 hour hiking trail, which is across some difficult territory and best suited for the experienced hiker, but certainly worth it for the lovely view from the summit. However, if you’re not the mountain-climbing type, the views from the foothills still make this a must-see destination! "

"Old Town Square, Prague","No list of the Czech Republic’s top destinations could possibly be complete without at least a mention of its iconic capital, which rises from the winding meanders of the Vltava River in the heartlands of Bohemia in a symphony of the Gothic, the Baroque and the Medieval. Steeped in history, the so-called City of a Hundred Spires is famed for its gloriously adorned Old Town, anchored on one photogenic central square that comes complete with a curious astronomical clock and the pointed turrets of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Travelers can also wander between the saintly statues of the Charles Bridge and up to Prague Castle (one of the largest on the continent), seek out the haunting ghosts of Kafka’s pages, or simply indulge in a medley of unpasteurized Czech beers, Bohemian dumplings and one of Europe’s liveliest nightlife scenes. Also browse our guide on the <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/top-25-things-to-do-in-prague/"">best things to do in Prague</a>. "
Cesky Krumlov,"A fairy-tale pop-up of a town that crowns a series of bluffs on the edge of the Vltava River south of Ceske Budejovice, Cesky Krumlov is one of the veritable jewels of South Bohemia. Its Old Town bears a well-deserved UNESCO tag for its maze of medieval streets, 13th century relics and layers of architectural history – much of which has remained unspoilt by conflict and war. However, the undisputed piece de resistance here has to be the soaring bulwarks, bridges and keeps of Cesky Krumlov castle, where Rococo parks and painted towers, the enthralling Church of St Vitus and even a moat laden with black forest bears all draw huge crowds of visitors right throughout the year.

Castle Karlstejn,"A towering monument cast in stone to the revered Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, Castle Karlstejn soars above the verdant Czech valleys just south-west of the capital at Prague. It’s a glorious Gothic array of turrets and gatehouses that’s come to be one of the most visited medieval relics in the nation. Travelers who come here are invited to scale the hill and pass under the two-storey port houses and into the central courtyards, where the so-called Big Tower and Chapel of the Holy Cross once held the priceless Royal Jewells and Imperial Regalia of the Czech kings. The views are another matter: rolling out to encompass the undulating hills of Bohemia and forested hinterland of the country on all sides. "
Freedom Square in Brno,"Pulsing with an indelible student energy during term times from its place in the southern depths of the Czech Republic, Brno – the regional capital of South Moravia – belies its local rep as a rather sleepy place with some of the country’s top drum and bass clubs and a booming café culture to rival both Prague and Vienna. There’s also a gorgeous Old Town district to see; the second largest in the country, where the spiked Neo-gothic towers of the Cathedral of St Peter and Paul stand watch over cobbled squares and the eerie tunnels of the Brno Ossuary lurk underground. Spilberk Castle crowns a bluff in the midst of the town too, while Brno Reservoir is a hubbub of recreational activity during the summer, offering boating, swimming and al fresco drinking opportunities aplenty.

Ostrava,"Sat just on the northern edge of Moravia, where the Czech Republic gives way to Silesia and the Polish borderlands, Ostrava is a down-to-earth gem of a city that fuses historical beauty and Baroque brilliance in its old town with an interesting mix of Soviet Realism, Russian Brutalism and post-industrial sprawl. Visitors can make a beeline for institutions like the Michal Colliery and unravel tales of Ostrava’s interesting industrial past, or walk through the city’s deeper histories between the neoclassical facades of Masaryk Square. Then there’s the resurgent Lower Vitkovice Area to explore, complete with glass elevators and viewing platforms, the Gong exhibition centre and monumental blast furnaces to name just a few of the enthralling sites. Learn more in our guide to the <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-ostrava-czech-republic/"">best things to do in Ostrava</a>. "
Karlovy Vary,"Regal, rich and oozing with all the charm you’d expect of a onetime royal retreat where the likes of Russian tsars and Beethoven met between the spas and bathhouses, Karlovy Vary (erstwhile Karlsbad) is unquestionably one of the most beautiful destinations in all of Bohemia. It comes decorated in elegant neoclassical styles, peppered with gorgeous fin de siècle builds and arrays of Art Deco fountains, all of which sit nestled neatly in the wooded valleys that enfold the famous mineral streams of the Tepla River. Visitors should be sure to check out the curious range of experimental holistic treatments that are on offer in the various spa centres here, going from sulphurous immersion baths to Turkic hammam sessions. And if that’s not for you, then check out the al fresco cafes on Vridelni Street, or head to the hills for some hiking, Bohemian style. Also see our <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-karlovy-vary-czech-republic/"">guide on Karlovy Vary</a>. "
Liberec,"100,000-strong Liberec is a charming and laid-back North Bohemian town that’s a great place to experience the Republic’s curious mix of Slavic, Germanic and Austrian cultures. The whole city is shrouded by the spiked top of Jested Mountain, which marks the beginning of the Jizera range that rises in a medley of Nordic ski tracks and fir forests on the very edge of Poland. Here, the main landmark of the city soars in hyperbole:  the hotel and panoramic restaurant of the Jested Tower crowning the hill. Meanwhile, in the town below – connected to this famous ridge by cable car – are the painted faces of Liberec Castle and oodles of gorgeous 19th century townhouses, not to mention some of the country’s most prestigious university departments. "
Ceske Budejovice,"The namesake and home of what’s still arguably the Czech Republic’s most iconic beer, Ceske Budejovice is awash with microbreweries, beer halls and traditional Czech taverns alike, making it without question one of the top spots to come and sample a traditional Slavic pivo (beer). The place was founded way back in the 13th century by King Premysl Otakar II, who now lends his moniker to the pretty array of colonnades and burgher mansions that forms the city’s central square. This is encircled by a crisscrossing web of cobblestone streets and adorned with the gilded Baroque carvings of Samson’s Fountain, while various museums chronicle the fascinating history of South Bohemia and the Budejovicky Budvar Brewery on the northern edge of the town remains one of the top draws. "
Lipno,"Hikers, bikers, water sports enthusiasts, skiers and snowboarders and Nordic walkers alike all flock to the lakeside mountain town of Lipno, which enjoys a beautiful location amidst the soft hills and contoured valleys of the Cesky Krumlov District, just a stone’s throw from the border with Austria. Small and compact, the town is a prime base for delving into the picture-perfect backcountry of South Bohemia, and comes complete with a 21-kilometer in-line skating circuit, a pretty reservoir, the interesting Lipno Dam and a range of red and blue ski runs that are perfectly suited to beginner and intermediate riders alike. "
Moravian Karst,"A land of more than 1,000 caves and grottoes, gorges and canyons, the Moravian Karst sprawls out over a whopping 92 square kilometers just north of the city of Brno. It’s famed for its array of breathtaking geological wonders, going from the sculpted stalactites and colossal stalagmites, underground rivers and sinkholes of the Punkva Caves to the domed chambers and winding corridors of the vast Amaterska system. The place is also home to the great Macocha Gorge &#8211; the largest sinkhole canyon of its kind in all of Central Europe that plays host to the bubbling headwaters of the Punkva River. Hiking, caving and biking opportunities abound here, and travelers can also seek out the Josefov blast furnaces and Chateau of Rajec nad Svitavou nearby. "
Olomouc,"Proudly off-the-beaten-track and bursting with student bars and coffee shops, Olomouc is one of the Czech Republic’s hidden gems. It can be found planted on the plains of eastern Moravia, oozing with more than 2,000 years of history that has its roots in Roman times. Shaped by the Germans, the Swedes, the Slavs and the Bohemian kings alike, the city hosts wonderful sites like the Saint Wenceslas Cathedral and Saint Maurice Church between the old ramparts of its onetime castle. However, it’s the UNESCO-attested Holy Trinity Column on the sprawling central square that really takes the biscuit; a masterful and honorific rendition of the Central European Baroque style that’s seen nowhere else on the continent! "
Pilsen,"Former European Capital of Culture holder (an honour which Pilsen shared with Mons in Belgium), and homeland of the now famed strain of beer that is its namesake (first brewed here by the Bavarian Josef Groll in the 19th century), Pilsen conceals oodles of interesting sights and attractions beneath its Old Town sea of red-tiled roofs. Yes sir, travelers can gawp at the great spires of St Bartholomew&#8217;s Cathedral, delve into one of Europe’s largest subterranean civic passage systems, see the curiously arabesque Great Synagogue and wonder at the elaborate Renaissance décor of the town hall by Giovanni de Statia. And when it’s time to sample that ubiquitous beer, the Pilsner Urquell brewery awaits, along with oodles of classic tank pubs and Czech taverns where unpasteurised brews flow from the taps. "
Kutna Hora,"Once the great economic rival of Prague that rose to prominence with the discovery of silver in the nearby hills of the Central Bohemian Region, Kunta Hora still bears all the hallmarks of a once rich and regal centre. Just take the magnificent spires of the Church of Saint Barbara, or the Italian Courtyard, where royal mints and erstwhile silver emporiums ooze with a certain medievalist nostalgia. Then there are the red-tiled roofs and Bohemian historicity of the Old Town; much less touristy and somewhat more authentic than its counterpart in Prague. Visitors here should also be sure not to miss the Kostnice Ossuary, where row upon row of human remains and elaborate chandeliers, statues and altarpieces made from human bones all make for one seriously haunting experience. "
Bohemian Paradise,"The first ever natural reserve in the Czech Republic is an enchanting land of towering hoodoos and canyons, curious chiselled cliffs, cascading gores and rugged hills, all dressed in sweeping dashes of pine forest, crisscrossed by winding hiking trails and dotted with the romantic silhouettes of castles like the precipitous Trosky keep. Visitors touring the region can delve into ancient rock towns that protrude almost organically from the sandstone ridges they stand on, explore dramatic dolomite caverns at Bozkov, see folksy timber architecture between the rustic villages, go lake hopping, kayaking or canyon scaling, enjoy horse riding in the shadow of ancestral chateaux – the list goes on! "
Krkonose National Park,"The impossibly beautiful and wild reaches of the Krkonose National Park can be found straddling the border with Poland in the extreme northeast of the country. Cut through by babbling mountain streams and dressed in swathes of mist-topped fir forests, this rugged land levels out at a peak on the summit of Snezka Mountain (the highest in the Czech Republic and entire Sudetes Range besides). Oodles of walking trails make their home here too, and ski fields pop up ad hoc in the winter months to boot, offering travelers an opportunity to really immerse themselves in the landscapes of meadows, knee timber, towering spruces, lichen-spotted rocks and rolling alpine vistas. "
"Kinshasa, DRC","The capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as one of the 11 provinces, is Kinshasa. It’s chaotic and buzzing with energy and really huge – with over ten million residents. Established by Henry Stanley in the late 19th century as a trading post it’s now likened to an African New York City.  Enjoy a boat ride on the Congo or a BBQ picnic on its shores.  The Marche des voleurs, or the city market, is colourful and intense and loads of fun. There is a great street art culture here and if you sit in one of the small cafes off the 30 Juin Boulevard, the artists will come up and show you their pieces for sale.  It&#8217;s a great way to talk to locals and relax. "
Lola Ya Bonobo,"Lola Ya Bonobo is a sanctuary for orphaned bonobos and one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Kinshasa area. The bonobos are hunted for bush meat, and when a mother is killed, the babies are often taken and sold on the black market as pets.  The sanctuary tries to recover as many as possible so that they can live out their lives in safety.  One of the four great apes, bonobos have been relatively isolated until the 20th century.  The sanctuary covers 30 hectares of forest and you can visit the several feeding stations that the staff use to help track the apes.  The sanctuary also accepts volunteers. "
Kahuzi Biega National Park,"Named after the 3,000+ metre Mt. Kahuzi and the 2,700+ metre Mt. Biega this spectacular national park is located in the South Kivu Province and stretches from the Congo River basin to Bukavu. Kahuzi and Biega are extinct volcanoes that now afford some incredible hiking. It was created in 1970 in order to protect the Eastern Lowland Gorillas and just ten years later was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Gorilla poaching has been a problem for decades but thanks to the park authority, a dedicated education effort is ongoing. Today, the gorillas are still endangered, but their quality of life has improved and conditions are improving year each year. You’ll find incredible biological diversity in the park like endemic plants, elephants, chimps, genet, antelope, and serval. "
Nyiragongo Volcano,"The skyline of Goma in the DRC is dominated by Nyiragongo. This unbelievable, 3,000+ metre volcano last erupted in 2011, destroying up to 15% of the surrounding land and leaving over 120,000 homeless. Erupting 34 times in the last 130 years, Nyiragongo is located at the junction where the African tectonic plate is breaking.  The landscape around Goma is striking, with black solidified lava so wide that the place looks like an above ground coal mine. There is an active lava lake inside the crater which can sometimes be visited. The area has recovered nicely from the last blast and you’ll find plenty of new shops and markets to discover. "
Virunga National Park,"Located along the borders of Rwanda and Uganda, Virunga National Park is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. As the country’s oldest national park, it’s also the most biologically diverse.  You’ll find lava plains, savannas, forests, valleys, active volcanoes, swamps, and even glacier peaks in the Rwenzori Mountains. Roughly 25% of endangered mountain gorillas call the park home, and Virunga is the only park to have three of the four great apes in one place. The Okapi, an endangered species that looks like a cross between a giraffe and a zebra, also make the park their home.  You can spot hippos, lions, elephants, and a number of rare and exotic birds. The park has three distinct areas, all worth a visit:  The Rwenzori Mountains, Lake Edward area, and the Mikeno volcano area. "
"Lake Kivu, Congo","Straddling the border between the DRC and Rwanda, Lake Kivu is the sixth largest lake in Africa.  One of a series of freshwater lakes in the region, Lake Kivu offers lovely scenic drives between the towns that dot her shores. From Cyangugu to Gisenyi, the gently winding road affords breathtaking vistas as you leisurely make your way. Tons of banana and eucalyptus trees line the road and the locals will pause and wave as you pass by. Gisenyi is the largish town that was once a colonial beach resort and so has some nice old mansions and great places to stop for a sundowner’s cocktail. "
Garamba National Park,"This national park is filled with unending grasslands and savannahs.  And these are filled with elephants, giraffes, hippos, black rhinos, and white rhinos.  Garamba National Park is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site and an amazing sanctuary for several endangered species.  It’s rare to see so many different classifications of large mammals sharing the same space and that makes a visit to the park an absolute must. "
Salonga National Park,"Salonga is both the DRC and Africa’s largest tropical rainforest.  In this UNESCO World Heritage Site you’ll find several endangered species including the Congo peacock, dwarf chimpanzees, forest elephants, and the slender-snouted crocodile. The park is quiet isolated and you must take a boat to reach it.  This vital ecosystem is so large that it plays an important role in climate regulation for the entire country. "
Okapi Wildlife Reserve,This UNESCO World Heritage Reserve is unique for the large variety of primates and exotic birds that call it home.  There are incredibly opportunities for trekking to some even more incredible waterfalls within the reserve.  The landscape along the Epulu and the Ituri rivers is simply stunning. Also calling the reserve home are the pygmy nomad tribes of the Efe and Mbuti hunters.  It’s a great place to see the endangered Okapi (about one-sixth of the entire population are found here). 
Maiko National Park,"In a country of remote locations and national parks, Maiko is the DRC’s most inaccessible national park.  It is also the only park where you’ll find all three of the country’s endemic species: the Okapi, the Congo peafowl, and the Grauer gorilla.  And don’t forget chimpanzees, elephants, leopards, and bongos.  Though it’s not well known or well visited, the forest represents an enormous carbon sink and its future protection is globally important to addressing climate change.  Within Maiko’s borders are the Simba Mai Mai people, who fled here in the 1960’s seeking a kind of political asylum. Today, the government is working to resettle the roughly 700 inhabitants in order to protect the forest. "
"Falls Of Zongo, Democratic Republic of Congo","Located in Bas-Congo (about 130 km from the city of Kinshasa), the Falls of Zongo represent Mother Earth at her best.  If you’re looking for a few days outside of the city, the Falls are a great option.  You can tent camp or rent a bungalow and explore the area for a couple of nights.  Enjoy hiking and taking a cool dip below the falls. "
Kisangani,"Kisangani, formerly Stanleyville, is the third largest city in the DRC and lies completely within the tropical forest. The city’s new name originates from the nearby Boyoma Waterfalls and means “the city on the island.” Kisangani has great shopping (check out the avenue de l’Eglise) and fantastic local restaurants.  It’s also known for its striking architecture and surprisingly makes a popular convention destination. Be sure to check out the many museums, botanical gardens, and zoo.  The Rasaire of Notre-Dame Cathedral in the Central market is particularly appealing to visitors. At the University of Kisangani you can view an impressive collection of East African and Congolese archaeological artefacts. "
Abuko Nature Reserve,"Created in the early 20th century to protect a water collection point for nearby communities, Abuko Nature Reserve is The Gambia’s first reserve – officially formed in the 1960’s. This area is rich in Gambian wildlife and is now the most visited tourist attraction in the country – with over 33,000 visitors each year. Conservation efforts are on-going in this 260 acre reserve with three primate species here as well as antelope, porcupine, African palm civets, crocodiles, galagos, and almost 300 bird species. A fun fact about Abuko is that it is the closest tropical forest to Europe. "
Banjul,"The capital of The Gambia is Banjul.  It’s a port city and is located on Saint Mary’s Island. Originally called Bathurst after the Secretary of State for the British Colonies, Banjul is the government seat for the country. For whatever reason, many tourists don’t give Banjul a second glance. But with the busy harbour, rich history, colonial architecture, and urban market, there is plenty to love about the city. Enjoy the street hawkers from Senegal and Guinea and the shop keepers packed into old colonial trading housing all creating a chaotic vibrancy to the commercial district. Be on the lookout for the traditional kirinting housing made of bamboo and traditionally owned by the poor farmers of the island. "
The Albert Market,"The activity hub of Banjul is the Albert Market. It was created in the mid-19th century and named after Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert. Even back then it was full of bartering, haggling, and chaotic buying. The market is exciting on its most boring day – which, really, is never! You’ll find shoes, carved wood masks, houseware, electrical gadgets, shoes, fantastic fabrics, fruit, vegetables, beauty supplies, clothes, you name it. Plan to spend a few hours to see it all and to really hone your negotiating skills. If you’re looking for a local food experience, Albert Market has a number of street vendors and drink stalls to choose from. "
Old Town,"Head toward wide and welcoming Ma Cumba Jallow Street just west of the ferry terminal in Banjul and you’ll find an unruly assortment of fading colonial buildings and traditional Krio-style clapboard homes. This is Old Town, which looks remarkably like Freetown in Sierra Leone because of the many Freetown families who settled here in the early 19th century. There’s lots of history to admire as you walk through this wonderful section of the city. "
Bijilo Forest Park,"Bijilo Forest Park, or Monkey Park, is located in the coastal zone, just 11km from Banjul. It’s a small reserve, relatively speaking, and is a point of pride for nearby locals. The trails here are well maintained and take you through incredibly lush flora, a gallery forest, grass and low bush, on your way to the dunes. The three primate species are the red colobus, vervet, and patas. Tourists are encouraged not to feed the monkeys as they can get pretty cheeky! Bird lovers will love the more than 100 species found in the park including osprey, bee-eaters, and francolin. The reviews seem to be consistent:  a charming reserve that everyone falls in love with. "
Brufut Beach,"Sitting between the Kombo South District and the Atlantic Ocean are the Brufut resort and village. Just 23km from Banjul the beach itself has terrific golden sand and lots of privacy. To reach the beach you have to climb down the cliffs, using paths that are quiet steep in places. Once you’ve arrived and staked your spot you’ll notice fishermen and women sparring fish, repairing nets, and waiting for a change in tide to take them back out on the water again. Because it’s so uncrowded, it’s great for everything – sunbathing, water sports, walks along the sand, and cycling. Visit nearby Sannah-Mentering, a sacred pilgrimage site for Gambian Muslims hoping for a blessing. "
Janjangbureh,"Also known as Georgetown, Janjangbureh is an old colonial administrative hub located on MacCarthy Island in the Gambia River. A walk through town will take you to the old Commissioner’s Quarter. This 200-year-old house was once inhabited by freed slaves. There is little tourist infrastructure here, which will the town more or less desirable depending on the type of holiday you’re on, but the number one reason that most people come to Janjangbureh is for the bird watching. Stay at a lodge or resort outside the city centre and spend a few days with the exotic birds of the area. "
Sanyang Village,"This is a sleepy beach village of about 7,000 people made up mostly of Wolof, Mandinka, Fula, and Jola tribes. Sangyang Beach, which is made up of Paradise, Osprey, and Pelican beaches, is considered by many to be the best beachfront in all of The Gambia. It was a popular attraction long before the tourist trail made its way there and has a long stretch of remote shore, surrounded by mangroves and lagoons. Perfect for those who want to get away from the crowds. The main economy is fishing and as such there is a fantastic fish market in the village. Great for people watching and meeting the locals. As a bonus, the area has many shaded footpaths for nature trekking. "
National Museum of Gambia,"Once the white only Bathurst Club, this historic building now houses the National Museum of Gambia. You’ll find a wide range of exhibits and displays here, including traditional Gambian life, the colonial history of Bathurst, information on the Senegambia stone circle sites, music, and dance. Though it is small, the museum is well planned to reveal the rich culture of this wonderful country. You won’t be able to miss the giant Kankurang mask hanging in the main hall. This powerful ritual mask is used during rites of passage and coming of age. "
Wassu Stone Circles,"Located in the Central River Region, these circles are believed to be the burial sites of ancient kings and chiefs. Dated to 750-1000 AD, the stones and layouts vary from 4-6 metres in diameter, with anywhere from ten to 20 stones each. Each stone has an average height of six feet and many tourists and archaeologists have puzzled over their origins and true meaning. Though the biggest concentration of stone circles is in the Wassu area, there are hundreds of circles throughout the country. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, local legend has it that if anyone disturbs the stones they will be cursed – a good clue as to why they have remained undisturbed for so long. "
Kachikally Crocodile Pool,"Sitting on nine acres in Bakau Old Town is the Kachikally Crocodile Pool. Locals believe in the healing powers of the water and it’s a popular place to come for a blessing. There are about 80 crocodiles that call the pool home and a cool dozen are usually immediately visible when you arrive. Also on site are an ethnography museum, souvenir shop, café, and nature trail. "
Makasutu Culture Forest,"This is a private woodland reserve dedicated to ecotourism in the Kombo Central District. With over 1,000 acres, the protected area is a pristine forest of riverine, palm and hardwood trees, mangrove creeks, salt flats, and savanna. In the 1990’s two Britons stepped in and began conservation efforts on this almost bare forest. This sacred land is now a popular day excursion that gives visitors a chance to see one of the most beautiful forested areas in The Gambia. "
Bambo Bar on the Gambia River,"There’s a popular quote that helps to explain the relationship between the country and the river:  &#8220;The Gambia River is the Gambia and the Gambia is the river Gambia.” The country exists as two strips of land on either side of the river and it’s definitely the dominate feature of the country. It’s become a popular tourist destination as it provides access to the interior as well as to Senegal and Guinea. A river boat cruise will bring you to some interesting wildlife, historic slave trade stations, and beautiful countryside. "
Serrekunda Market,"The largest town in The Gambia is Serrekunda, a market town with a population of just under half a million people. This is where you’ll find the Batik Factory, where tie-dyed and batik fabrics are made. It’s the perfect place for beautiful and personal souvenirs for home. The national pastime of the Senegambia region is wrestling and in Serrekunda they take it quite seriously. Each wrestler has a small group of drummers who amp up the crowd with energetic beats before a bout. T he rules are pretty loose, but if it gets too dirty, someone will step in and stop the bout.  Usually! "
Tanji Fish Market,"The Gambian coast is full of fishing villages along the coast.  The busiest and most popular is the village of Tanji. Everything happens right on the beach, which doesn’t make for good swimming, but does make for dramatic people watching. Enjoy the fish market and the fish-smoking centre right in the heart of it all. The Tanji Village Museum educates visitors on Gambian traditions and lifestyle. Bird lovers will enjoy the Tanji River Bird Reserve – six square miles of savannah habitats and marine wetland along the river. There are over 300 bird species here include 34 raptors.  You’re also likely to see bushback, hyena, green monkeys, and the red colobus. If you’ve got the time, be sure to check out the Bijol Islands, where they have over 20,000 birds and seals and whales have been spotted from time to time. "
Rotterdam,"Once little more than a fishing village dating from the 13th century, Rotterdam is now a thoroughly modern city. Largely destroyed during WWII, architecture has become a thriving form of expression since reconstruction began. Check out the Erasmus Bridge, the Cube Houses, and Kunsthal Museum for some interesting examples. And for something truly unique, visit Market Hall with its 11,00o square meter ceiling-mural that covers the farmer’s stalls.  In the summer enjoy the International Film Festival and the North Sea Jazz Festival. And if you’re in the mood for history, Delfshaven district, which lies near the harbour, is the place that the pilgrims launched from in 1620. The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen includes Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Dali, and more, in its permanent collection. "
"Binnenhof, The Hague","Perhaps the most astounding place to visit in The Netherlands, The Hague is a place of huge sophistication and world-class art.  Nicknamed the Royal City by the Sea thanks to the royals who live there, The Hague is best known for the exhibits at the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis and the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. Summer visitors fall in love with Scheveningen’s beaches. Parliament, or Binnenhof, is located in The Hague, though Amsterdam is the capital. Be sure to visit the 360 view at Panorama Mesdag, and the miniature city of Madurodam. "
Leiden,"Just 20km from The Hague is the perfect place for a canal ride on the Old Rhine.  Leiden, Rembrandt’s birthplace, has been a university town since the 16th century and a mecca for culture lovers.  The many museums in town are all within walking distance of each other and make for a fabulous few days of exploring.  Though the university is the country’s oldest and most prestigious, the modern batch of students helps to invigorate a lively night life. You’ll enjoy exploring Gravensteen, the Old Latin School, and the huge steepled church of Pieterskerk. "
Haarlem,"Right in the heart of the tulip region is charming Haarlem, a testament to the Dutch Golden Age.  Because it’s largely unchanged, it’s easy to imagine the city as it was in the 17th century as you stroll down cobbled streets.  Known as Bloemenstad, or flower city, Haarlem sits alongside the Spaarne River and still has many of its medieval buildings.  Tourists come for the museums, shopping, and architecture; much of which can be found in Grote Markt Centre. Teylers Museum has exhibits in art, science and natural history and is the oldest museum in Holland. Art lovers will want to visit Franz Hals Museums to see the Dutch masters and everyone will love the Annual Bloemencorso Parade. "
Kinderdijk,"If the Netherlands had an icon, it would be the windmills.  And if windmills had a not-to-be-missed spot, it would be Kinderdijk. Because the country is at or below sea-level, windmills have been a crucial part of water management put in place to prevent flooding. Just a short excursion outside of Rotterdam, Kinderdijk, which means “children’s dike,” is where you’ll find 19 fully functioning and phenomenal windmills.  Built in the 18th century and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, they are truly something to see.  During the winter you can lace up some skates and enjoy the fun on the frozen canals. "
Amsterdam,"It’s unlikely that you need information about Amsterdam’s reputation as a party town, but this large city is deeper than the infamous red light district and liberal cannabis laws. There are 60 miles of canals to explore and over 1500 monumental buildings and bridges.  Fantastic museums and endless small eccentricities make Amsterdam a delightful city to discover.  You’ll want to include the Rijksmuseum Museum, the Anne Frank House, and the Prinsengracht district for shopping, pub crawling, and coffee drinking. The Canal Ring has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it’s wonderful to walk or bike around. "
Utrecht,"Considered to be the religious heart of Holland, Utrecht is an ancient town.  Established by the Romans in 48AD, the history of the Middle Age is on full display.  The inner canal wharf system, originally designed to keep the Rhine from flooding the city, is a brilliant piece of architecture left over from this period. The most famous landmarks are the 8th century Gothic Dom Tower and the Gothic Cathedral of Saint Martin (13th century). There’s also the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Rietveld Schroder House, the Dick Bruna House, and the Miffy Museum. When you want some time out-of-doors, stroll along the Oudegracht Canal and stop in to one of the converted cellar cafes for a coffee long the way. "
Maastricht,"This is a city with a diverse cultural history, which makes it seem a bit of an outsider in this Dutch country.  You’ll see Roman and Spanish ruins as well as French architecture throughout town.  There are even hills here! Sitting on both sides of the Meuse River, Maastricht is beautiful and full of historic churches and squares.  Popular attractions include het Vrijthof square, the Caves of St Pieter and the Casement, Saint Servatius Church, and Vestigingswerkens.  If you feel like splurging, check out any of the five Michelin-starred restaurants or some of the incredible cafes or bars in the town square. "
Hoge Veluwe,"Take a spin on one of 1700 free bicycles that the park staff keep on hand and spend a day exploring  all of the 41km of paths in De Hoge Veluwe National Park.  This national treasure is made up of 5,400 hectares of woods, heath, sand dunes, and peat bogs.  This is a great spot for bird watching with Res List species like the Wryneck, the Moor Frog, and the Wheatear that call it home.  There’s also unique plant species, red deer, and wild boar.  Deep in the heart of De Hoge Veluwve is the Kröller-Müller Museum, with a surprising number of Van Goghs.  Nearby are Elburg and Arnhem with medieval buildings and the historical site of the Battle for Arnhem. "
Nijmegen,"Close to the German border, Nijmegen recently celebrated its 2000th anniversary. As one of the oldest towns in the Netherlands it is home to two history museums that highlight Roman artefacts and traditional life. The large student population from the country’s only Catholic university brings energy to the place. Take a walk along the Waalbrug (the bridge that crosses the Waal River) in order to catch an awe-inspiring sunset, complete with boats below. In the centre of Nijmegan is the historical quarter and not far from that you’ll find the National Fietsmuseum Velorama that showcases over 250 bikes.  A real peek into the Dutch obsession with two-wheelers. "
Delft,"Just like Amsterdam, Delft is built on a series of canals that were originally designed to defend the city. An entire weekend can easily be spent strolling through the historic quarter and exploring the markets.  Johannes Vermeer, who painted The Girl with the Pearl Earring, among many others, called Delft home.  You’ll find it to be a progressive town that has worked hard to restore its historical feel.  Popular sites include Renaissance styled City Hall, the Prinsenhof Museum (where William of Orange was assassinated), the Vermeer Centrum, and several lovely churches including Nieuwe Kerk and Oud. If you need to pick up gifts to take home, consider the blue, hand-painted earthenware that been fired here since the 17th century. "
Terschelling,"Off the north coast are five islands collectively known as the Wadden Islands. They’re part of a larger chain of 50 that are dotted along the Wadden Sea between Denmark and the Netherlands. Each is unique and a great place for outdoor adventurers. Bird watchers will want to head straight to Terschelling, beach lovers will want to make Texel their first stop, and for those that want a remote trek through the woods, Vlieland is perfect. A boat will take you to any of the five, but for those that love a challenge you can also try wadlopen (mud-walking) across the seabed during low tide. Only for the truly brave &#8211; as some have called it “horizontal alpinism!” "
Gouda,"Because it’s easily accessible by rail and car, Gouda is an extremely popular day trip from Amsterdam.  Famous for its cheese (yes, THAT Gouda) and stroopwafels (syrup waffles) this is a traditional Dutch town that’s full of charm.  Visit St Janskerk with its colourful and incredible stained glass windows, a town hall that dates to the 15th century, and the Waag, an old cheese weighing house built in the 17th century and which is now home to the Kaaswaag, Holland’s cheese museum. "
Groningen,"With two colleges, this culturally diverse town is a major destination for those interested in arts, education, and business. The Groningen Museum is one of the most popular in all of the Netherlands but you’ll also find a comics museum, graphic museum, university museum, and a maritime museum. Live entertainment at the cafes, as well as fantastic theatre, round out the cultural aspects of this small but vibrant city. For those interested in Groningen’s nightlife, check out the Vismarkt, The Grote Markt, and the Peperstraat. "
Friesland in Winter,"This is your typical Dutch province, but with a few twists.  Not only do they have their own language here, but the locals are a hardy, self-reliant group – even by Dutch standards. The north end of Friesland morphs into the Waddenzee and the land goes from solid to muddy so the people had to actually build and fortify the land here.  It’s incredible to explore and UNESCO designated.  Visitors love Leeuwarden and Hindeloopen two charming villages that cater to tourists and have lots of tradition to soak up.  Right across the water you’ll find the Wadden Islands "
Palaui Island,"Palaui Island perfectly represents why most travelers come to the Philippines- to find a paradise where it feels like you’re the first human to ever step foot. That’s what it feels like on Palaui Island. You can find deserted beaches, eerie caves, crystal clear waterfalls, endless rice fields, and some of the cleanest air you’ve ever breathed. As if Scotland had a baby with South East Asia, you’ll find bright green grass lying flat atop steep cliffs overlooking the sea. The terrain here is vast and varied. One day you could spend hours hiking through vibrant green rice fields and jungle paths only meeting water buffalo along the way; the day after you could beach hop all day from one patch of white shore to the next. For nature lovers, there are no limits here. "
Siargao,"Situated at the northeastern tip of Mindanao, 800 kilometers south of Manilla, is a dream-come-true island called Siargao. You’ve got a couple options of where to stay when you visit. The most popular option is General Luna Beach. This lively little island town is filled with restaurants, resorts, shops, and people- yet still encapsulates that small beach town charm. "
Kawasan Falls On Cebu Island,"Everything you could ever want in a dream vacation is right here on Cebu Island. Cebu is such a convenient spot for a holiday as you can fly into nearby Mactan-Cebu International Airport located close to beaches, restaurants, and accommodation. You can get local by visiting family-owned watersport companies that will take you out parasailing, jet skiing, and banana boating. You can go on an island hopping tour to snorkel and even each raw sea urchin from the bottom of the ocean. Down south you’ll find Tumalog Falls, a 5-story natural waterfall that has created a clear pool of water where the sun shines through the trees. Best of all, off the coast of Oslob Beach on Cebu Island, you can go swimming with wild Whale Sharks. "
Malapascua,"Odds are, you’ve never even heard of Malapascua. It’s small, remote, and doesn’t offer much in terms of nightlife- but if you want a once-in-a-lifetime diving experience, this is where to get it. Off the shores of Malapascua, you have the opportunity to swim with schools of Thresher Sharks. With its long, distinctive tail that cuts through the water as it gracefully hovers over the ocean floor, swimming with a Thresher Shark can be a thrilling experience. "
Palawan,"The mother of all things magical and mystical in the Philippines is Palawan. It is home to El Nido (which deserves a rank of its own on this list) and many more mysterious Disney-esque destinations that attract travelers from all over the world. It’s capitol, Puerto Princesa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as if this island wasn’t already impressive enough. Everyone knows that you can find El Nido and Coron in the North with breath taking cliffs that wind together to create crazy waterfalls, passageways and landscape, but what about further south? Check out Brooke’s Point that is home to Bakbakan Falls and Mainit Hot Springs where you can bath in hot pools of medicinal water. Also check out Rizal which is home to some cool eco houses where you can kayak, surf, and snorkel. "
El Nido,"Unlike Malupascua, everyone knows of El Nido. Yet, this stretch of island has managed to keep its pure beauty in tact. El Nido is considered to be a world of its own and has some of the most breathtaking natural landscapes and scenery in the Philippines- and perhaps, in the world. "
Bohol,"The number one travel tip to get the most out of your Bohol experience is to find a local tour guide(s) to hire and befriend for your time spent on the island. This island is filled with hidden nature spots including secret waterfalls, fisherman-only rivers, off-the-beaten path piers with handicraft markets, local grilled seafood spots, and more that you won’t find on your own. The local motorbike tour guides here draw a blurred line between tour guide and friend. They will open up to you, welcome you, and go the extra mile to make your time unforgettable. Get ready for a homegrown experience full of natural adventures on this surprisingly underrated island. "
Dumaguette,Come to Dumaguette where you can take a day trip across to Aple Island which translates into ‘Turtle Island’. You’ll see big sea turtles constantly surfacing for air all around you. Jump off the boat and go for a swim with them. These turtles are actually quite used to have tourists splashing around them so they will let you get pretty close for photos and experiences that make time go super slow- just respect their space. Don’t forget to check out Cassaroro Falls- you won’t be disappointed. 
MoalBoal,"The island of MoalBoal is home to Badian Canyon- a winding canyon of waterfalls, rock formations, and fluorescent blue water that looks like someone has been pouring food coloring in drop by drop. One of the most memorable experiences you can have in the Philippines is to take a full-day guided trip that involves jumping from high places and getting wet. More specifically, you’ll be guided through narrow crevasses filled with waterfalls, tropical foliage, natural pools of water and natural waterslides. At the end of your day-long journey, you’ll come to Kawawan Falls- a waterfall that you have to see to believe. You’ll wear a helmet, life jacket, and be sure to bring a pair of tennis shoes. "
Bantayan Island,
Coron Island,"It’s not the easiest to access, but utopia never is. While every island might claim to be the most beautiful, the most pristine, the most memorable- Coron actually takes the cake. It’s magical. Getting there will involve either a 5-hour ferry from El Nido or you can take a (slightly expensive) puddle jumper flight from Manilla- but once you arrive, every penny and every second of travel spent will be immediately worth it. First thing to do is to rent a scooter and go. Wind through golden fields, dusty roads, and rolling hills to discover the most incredible views. The contrasting colors of dry landscape to lush jungle next to white sand and crystal blue water cannot be described in words. Spend the entire day feeling like a pioneer who is discovering an island for the first time. No tourists, few villages, and certainly no big development. "
Cambari,"The perfect sunset exists on Cambari Island, just off the coast of Palawan’s Araceli. Go for the day where you can investigate the unique rock formations that create a fantastic collection of caves to explore. You’ll find several caves filled with pools of water where you can swim in what feels like your own private swimming pool. The turquoise water sparkles with soft white sand on the bottom clearly visible from the surface. Go snorkeling and discover the gorgeous corals and all the biodiversity which they hold, including monster lobsters and graceful manta rays. "
Luzon,"Luzon Island is one of the most important islands as it is home to the capitol of the Philippines, Manilla. Most travelers skip over Manila completely as they expect that it’s just another Asian city with traffic, shopping, and bars, which is true. But what most travelers don’t know is that there are some spectacular hiking opportunities just a bus ride away from the capitol. Health freaks and workout rats will love the hiking that surrounds this city. Take a mini bus to Pico de Loro to hike Mt. Palay 664 meters above sea level. You can camp out on the mountain in various campsites where you’ll meet other travelers. Also accessible from Manila is Mt. Batuloa 811 meters above sea level and just an hour away from Manila. This trail is perfect for beginners who want a day hike to capture amazing views. "
Siquijor Island,"Rent a motorbike and tour the entire perimeter of the island within a couple days. Stopping by waterfalls, swimming holes, and white sand beaches, you’ve never felt so free. Go cliff jumping into the clean and clear water, trek into the jungle, and eat until you’re stuffed. You’ll also have a chance to get in touch the history of the Philippines on this island by visiting tons of Spanish-influenced landmarks such as St Francis de Assisi Church and the thought-provoking (and dilapidating) St. Isidore de Labrador Church. You really get the best of both worlds on this little island off the coast of Bohol. "
Guimaras Island,"Here are a handful of white sand beaches hiding in plain site! Guimaras Island is home to three pristine beaches: Nagarao, Inampulogan, and Nauway. These tranquil beaches rarely see any foreign visitors and occasionally get visits from playful groups of Filipino friends looking for an adventure. You’d think an island that is home to a mango tree plantation, marine reserves, lighthouses, catholic churches, caves, a sea turtle conservation center, incredible restaurants, waterfalls, and undisturbed photo opportunities that there would be more visitors- but this island hasn’t hit the holidaymaker map…yet. "
Calaguas Islands,"In the Province of Camarines Norte lies a group of untouched virgin islands that should be on every Eden-lover’s bucket list. When you want to get away from the world, wifi, and reality TV stars, these dots in the ocean are where to go. Most tourists spend with day swimming at Long Beach, a sprawling piece of white sand with volcanic rock at both ends, while having a picnic on the shore. "
Batan Island,"Take a break from the beaches and bathing suits and step into the country. This dumbbell-shaped volcanic island is a sprawling landscape of farming plots, rice fields, and forests, all neatly separated with natural fences that create a quilt-like design. It’s a different world out here as you’ll learn via the honesty system at Honesty Coffee Shop. With no store attendants, you are free to pick up your goodies as you please, leaving the right amount of money as you check out. Fun fact: Located at the most northern tip of the Philippines’ chain of islands, Batan was the first island to be inhabited during the Japanese invasion. "
Club Tara Resort In Bucas Grande Island,"Swimming with jellyfish, exploring underground caves and tunnels, enjoying winding boat tours through mountainous passageways, and fishing with locals- that’s what you can expect on a trip to Bucas Grande Island. "
Malalison Island,"Activities, activities, activities! Malalison Island is perfect for the travelers who love to trek, snorkel, and discover local culture. To explore this slice of heaven, you must hire a guide to take you trekking. You’ll spend the day on a moderately easy trek through the gorgeous mountains where the guide will point out wildlife, flora, and fauna. You will eventually make it to a small cave on the other side of the island where you can hop on a big bamboo swing and purchase snacks from the local shop. Take your snorkeling gear with you as there is a small wildlife sanctuary where you can snorkel with the fish. After your long hike, relax on a beautiful sandbar where boats will be waiting to take you back. "
Panay Island,"Getting off the beaten path is the most fruitful in the Philippines. Stay in the Kalibo area where you’ll find tons of beachfront guest houses that are not only less crowded, but also less expensive. I’m talking about beachfront villas for half the price that you would pay on Boracay. "
Corregidor Island,"Take a step into the past as you visit the island of Corregidor. What was once a battle ground between American, Japanese, and Filipino troops during World War II is now a piece of history. You can visit this tiny island fortress where you’ll be able to picture the battles as they happened for yourself. See firsthand relics of the war as you go through a guided tour visiting the light hours, the barracks, and some humbling monuments. When you want to lighten the mood, there are bird watching and boat tours around the island. The easiest way to visit Corregidor is to join a tour group that will organize your transportation and offer lunch. "
Great Santa Cruz Island,"This little spec in the middle of the ocean could easily be a picture on a postcard. If you are a nature buff, here is home to some of the most diverse wildlife and marine life in the Philippines. Check out the mangrove forest where jungle trees have popped up while still half submerged in water. Grab your snorkel mask and head out into the corals where you’ll find colorful fish of all kinds. Bring your towel and a book to work on your tan on the beach. This is just the most peaceful place to explore for a day. You can book your tours in Zamboanga City where everything will be arranged for you. "
Tawi-Tawi,"How far would you go for paradise? Tawi-Tawi’s location is quite surprising. This island is actually closer to Malaysia than it is the Philippines, which is why you’ve probably never heard of it. But I can guarantee you that after today you’ll never forget it. Because of its location, this island is full of totally unique culture and traditions- almost like it’s own little country. Food is a blend of Malay and Filipino and the people speak with a unique accent. While you’re there, you can climb the mountain called Bud Bongao which locals believe can heal disease. You can visit some mosques, as there is quite a large Muslim population here. You can also visit Sama Dilaut Village where you’ll find rows of wooden houses on stilts over water. Did I mention white sand beaches? You’ve never seen anything like this island. "
"PBMA Founder&#8217;s Shrine, San Jose, Dinagat Island","A day won’t feel like enough when you visit San Jose on Dinagat Island. There is so much to see and so many people who want to share their hospitality. This is a chance to see how life is like outside of the big cities and popular tourist destinations while stepping into small town life. As you come in by boat from Surigao City, you’ll pass unique rock formations that look like huge crystals popping out of the ground. At the top of the island, you’ll see castle built by a local islander who craved the best views. There’s a lighthouse, beautiful jungle hills, and as you approach the port, a quaint line of colorful boats all in a row. As you disembark and head into town, it might feel like you’ve stepped onto a Caribean island with bright yellow and green houses lining narrow streets as locals sit on their porch watching the day go by. "
Britania Islands,"The aquatic version of Bohol’s ‘Chocolate Hills’ are right here in San Agustin. The Britania Islands are a collection of 24 “islets” or small islands that have popped up all over this narrow region. Take an Island hopping tour and you’ll visit the 4 main islands with the most to offer. You’ll see the most serene contrast of colors out on these ‘middle of nowhere’ islands and you’ll also visit a ‘Cast Away’ style island with a small beach full of interesting limestone formations. The most enjoyable part of this island tour however, is cruising on a catamaran all day while living the tropical life. Palawan "
Avignon,"For a time in the middle ages this city on the banks of the Rhône was the centre of western Christendom. Six papal conclaves were held in the spellbinding Palace of the Popes in the 14th century, and the building has fascinating little vestiges from this time, like the invaluable gothic frescoes still on the walls of the papal apartments. The exalted ruins of Pont Saint-Bénézet are also from this period, poking out half-way across the river, guarded by a gatehouse and boasting the little medieval chapel of Saint Nicholas. Browse the arty walled town, take a cruise on the Rhône, and see if you can come for the Theatre Festival in July, when Avignon becomes one giant stage. "
Carcassonne,"The Cité de Carcassonne, above the right bank of the Aude is a sight that can you dream: Walls have encircled this part of the city since the 4th century, but they were beefed up in the 13th century to stand as a barrier against the Crown of Aragon to the south. After the 1600s they were no longer needed and allowed to decay, until the architect Viollet-le-Duc came along and gave them a romantic overhaul in the 1800s. Carcassonne has much more besides: The Canal du Midi crosses the city and is a mind-blowing accomplishment from the 1600s, while the stained glass windows in the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus are some of the loveliest you will ever see. "
Aix-en-Provence,"Aix differs from the first two entries in that people visit this town, not so much for sights, but for its less tangible, atmospheric qualities. On the evocative Cours Mirabeau, with its plane trees, fountains and elegant mansion, you&#8217;ll visit the haunts of the many famous personalities connected to Aix, like Paul Cézanne, Ernest Hemingway and Émile Zola. You can continue the Cézanne theme by making the pilgrimage to Montaigne Saint-Victoire, just to the east of the city. This jagged limestone ridge was a scene that Paul Cézanne returned to paint time and again in the late-19th century. "
Promenade des Anglais,"Nice is grander, a city of spacious squares and long esplanades. It was one of the first coastal destinations to attract tourists, furnishing it with imposing 19th-century palaces and hotels on the Promenade des Anglais. You can duck down the alleys of Vieux Nice to shop at the boutiques and flower market at Cours Selaya, or ascend the Colline du Château for a view that never ceases to delight. If you don&#8217;t mind pebbles you can also join the select few who go down to sun bathe on Nice&#8217;s beaches. Even in July and August it&#8217;s never exactly heaving on the shore and most visitors stick to the promenade. Nice also has a clutch of artists who swore by the city: Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse both have dedicated museums here. "
Albi,"Chances are you&#8217;ll know one of Albi&#8217;s most famous sons even if you don&#8217;t recognise his name: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec painted those iconic scenes of dancers at the Moulin Rouge, and created the art nouveau posters inextricably associated with the Belle Époque. The museum in his name at the Albi&#8217;s Episcopal Palace has the largest single collection of his work in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. Its brick gothic home is also a UNESCO site, part of a group of dominating red brick buildings designed to inspire awe. None more so than Albi cathedral, which looks like a fortress and was erected in the 13th century as a declaration of Catholic power after the suppression of the Cathar sect in this region. "
Lourmarin,"The little town just to the south of the Luberon Massif is the quintessence of Provence. All the ingredients are here, particularly the landscape of mountains, orchards and vineyards that frames the Caselas belfry. Lourmarin is one of France&#8217;s &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; villages, but is much more than an outdoor museum: It&#8217;s a lively little place, with 15 cafes and restaurants that make use of what little outdoor space they can find on this tangle of streets. And, inevitably, there&#8217;s a cultural giant linked to the town. Albert Camus lived and wrote here, and is buried in the town&#8217;s cemetery. "
Biarritz,"In the 19th century the European elites &#8220;discovered&#8221; Biarritz, and turned it from a seaside village into one of Europe&#8217;s most luxurious resorts. Summing up this swift transformation is the Hôtel du Palais, built as a summer getaway in 1855 for Eugénie de Montijo, Empress of the French and wife of Napoleon III. Families flock to the Grand Plage, a broad golden sandy beach in front of regal turn-of-the- century landmarks like the Casino Barrière. There are also good swells for surfers on the Grand Plage, as well as at Côte des Basques just along the shore. "
Uzès,"North of Nîmes, with its profusion of Roman monuments, is the understated town of Uzès. The nerve centre of this little place is the Place aux Herbes, where in summer the sunlight is scattered by the square&#8217;s plane trees, and the arcades on all sides shelter restaurants and cafes. One of the south&#8217;s most celebrated markets is also held in these arches on Saturdays. The square is the best place to begin a walking tour of this town with its feudal towers and creamy limestone mansions from the 1600s and 1700s. You can scale the 100 steps of the Royal Tower for the best view of the symbolic Tour Fenestrelle, the romanesque campanile of Uzès Cathedral. "
Marseille,"Chaotic, cosmopolitan and edgy, Marseille challenges all of the stereotypes about Provence and the French Riviera. It&#8217;s France&#8217;s second city and the country&#8217;s largest port, with a lot of diversity, epitomised by the hectic Nouailles Market. The colossal Old Port, founded by the Phocaeans 2,600 years ago, is still the best place to see Marseille in action. And for one of France&#8217;s most recognisable landmarks, make your way up to Notre-Dame de la Garde, at the highest point in the city, just to the south of the Old Port. The new MuCEM is a high-profile attraction devoted to the history of the Mediterranean, while Marseille can also be your gateway to the Calanques, those vast fjord-like cliffs to the south of the city. "
Pézenas,"Up to the late-1700s Pézenas was the seat of the Governors of Languedoc, which has left this town in Hérault with plenty of stately renaissance and  baroque architecture for a place with just 8,000 inhabitants. More than 100 buildings have been listed as &#8220;historic&#8221; in Pézenas. You can check in with the tourism office for the locations of all of Pézenas&#8217; &#8220;hôtels&#8221;, and begin a walking tour you won&#8217;t soon forget. A famous citizen from this period is the revered 17th-century comedy writer Molière, who performed at the theatre here several times in the 1650s and spent time in the court of Armand de Bourbon, the Prince of Conti, inspiring some of his early works. There&#8217;s a small exhibition to the writer at this plush monument. "
Arles,"A UNESCO site for its abundance of Roman and romanesque architecture, Arles has a Roman theatre, amphitheatre, baths, necropolis and aqueduct to discover. The 12th-century Church of St. Trophime is immensely valuable too, for the peerless romanesque sculptures above the portal. The city didn&#8217;t miss out on impressionist painters either, as van Gogh produced some 300 works in his year in Arles, and shared the &#8220;Yellow House&#8221; with Gauguin for nine weeks. Arles is also in the north of the Camargue, a region of salt flats, marshes and meadows where semi-feral white horses roam free, and fighting bulls are bred for export to Spain. Between April and June the briny lagoons and reedy marshes in the Camargue teem with thousands of flamingos, one of the most amazing natural spectacles in the south. "
Toulouse,"On the Garonne River, the old centre of this university city is replete with stately 18th-century neoclassical buildings all made with a pinkish terracotta. This has won Toulouse the nickname &#8220;La Ville Rose&#8221;, exemplified by the glorious facade of the Capitole. There are older monuments in the city, sure to set historians&#8217; pulses racing. The Church of the Jacobins is the resting place of Thomas Aquinas, the 12th-century friar with a lasting influence on modern philosophy. You can spot the World Heritage Basilica of Saint-Sernin by its spired bell-tower, and if you take a close look, you&#8217;ll see how the design of the arches changes with phase of construction. "
Gordes,"A typical &#8220;village perché&#8221;, Gordes is a small medieval town on a hilltop in the Luberon range. Gordes is one of the &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; villages in France, and you can be sure that it intends to remain so. Any new buildings in Gordes must be built with limestone and capped with terracotta tiles! Like many of Provence&#8217;s rustic settlements, Gorde has attracted celebrities in their droves. The town&#8217;s cobblestone streets coil around the hill, and at the top is a renaissance castle containing the town hall and a small art museum. Minutes from here is Sénanque Abbey, feted for the image of its walls at the end of a lavender field. "
Bordeaux,"Another of the south of France&#8217;s many World Heritage sites is Bordeaux&#8217;s historic quarter. This was mostly planned in the 1700s, when the city became too big to keep within the walls. So there was a large urban remodel endowing Bordeaux with many of the sights and monuments people adore today. This goes for Grand Théâtre, Place de la Bourse and the Place du Parlement. Add these to the list of medieval must-sees, like the Grosse Cloche, the 15th-century belfry of the old town hall, and the ghostly gothic cathedral. We haven&#8217;t even mentioned that Bordeaux is the world capital of wine, or that it&#8217;s a fun-loving university town with some of France&#8217;s best nightlife outside Paris. "
Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,"The little capital of the Alpilles, a small range of low mountains to the south of Avignon, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence is a medieval town blasted by the legendary mistral in winter and spring. On clear days this creates that unique light that attracted the impressionists, and van Gogh made 150 paintings in and around this town. Art lovers will get frissons when they notice a scene or building immortalised by the artist. Saint-Rémy-de-Provence is adorned with mansions from the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was a prestigious place to be. This was partly to do with Glanum, the ancient city a few minutes&#8217; walk from the town. There&#8217;s a 2,000 year-old triumphal arch, sacred spring and one of the most intact mausoleums in the former Roman world. "
Cornwall,"Visitors flock to Cornwall to experience over 300 miles of blustery coastline complete with rolling sand dunes, craggy cliffs, and medieval architecture. Rambling, climbing, or simply picnicking on secluded beaches or in flower strewn meadows are all popular pastimes here, or the adventurous can go surfing or body boarding, as Cornwall is known as the premium surf destination in the United Kingdom due to its churning seas and perfect barrels. The area has long been the favorite haunt of artists, painters, and writers who have taken inspiration from the romantic and rugged surroundings and you may just feel like the main character from a great British novel as you stroll along the deserted and stunning moors. "
"Ullswater, Lake District","Often considered the place to come if you want to experience the most beautiful scenery in England, the Lake District doesn’t disappoint, with lush green valleys and sprawling woodlands. The area is of course famous for its glacial lakes, so if you are a fan of the great outdoors then you can choose a gentle stroll around the countryside, or more strenuous hikes and rambles across rolling hills. As you travel around the region you will find charming towns and villages full of local inns, pubs, and restaurants serving local fare, and the light in the Lake District has long attracted artists and painters, meaning that you will find a whole host of art galleries if you want to take a piece of the region home with you. "
Brighton,"Brighton is a famously eclectic city that will at once show you a traditional seaside experience of restored piers, seaside games, and classic treats like Brighton rock. Visitors here can stroll along typical British beaches complete with donkey rides, and enjoy fish and chips overlooking the sea. On the other hand however, Brighton is also a relaxed and tolerant city that is the host of the annual Gay Pride March, and home to bohemian areas that host flea markets and alternative pop up events. "
"Bristol Avon River, Bath","Bath takes its name literally from the Roman Baths that dot the city and which were once the favorite holiday destination of the British elite who came here for the supposed healing properties of the waters. Visitors here can still experience the preserved baths, as well a wealth of small museums housed in restored traditional buildings, usually the cities iconic Georgian terraces such as One Royal Crescent. Bath is rapidly gaining fame as a place with some serious fine dining that will delight visiting foodies, but for something more classic try the famous Bath buns, sweet dough balls sprinkled with sugar. "
Edinburgh,"The capital of Scotland, Edinburgh is a seamless mix of old and new, at once a city that still hosts medieval architecture and the dominating Edinburgh Castle that watches over the city, as well as exciting nightlife, festivals, and contemporary museums. In addition to Gothic buildings and the Old Town which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, you will also find up and coming restaurants that represent the best of traditional Scottish cuisine like haggis with a modern twist, and Edinburgh is also famous for literary and arts festivals such as the Edinburgh Fringe. If you enjoy nightlife then there is a vibrant clubbing and bar scene in the city, or if you happen to be visiting at New Year you can witness Hogmanay, the traditional Scottish celebration that includes fire balls and a parade. "
Birmingham,"As the United Kingdom’s second largest city, Birmingham, in the Midlands, has something for everyone to enjoy. A famous industrial zone, Birmingham may be light on period architecture and picturesque sights, but it makes up for this with a wealth of shopping opportunities and modern buildings with often quite eccentric design elements such as the Selfridge’s building. The arts are strongly represented in Birmingham with art galleries, museums, and festivals, and there is a throbbing nightlife scene on the city. If you want to try some of the local cuisine, then Birmingham claims to have invented the Balti curry, and you can head to the Balti Triangle that comprises over fifty curry houses to try this regional delicacy firsthand. "
Manchester,"Often referred to as England’s ‘Second City’ or the ‘Capital of the North’, Manchester is of course home to the Manchester United football team, making it the perfect place for sports lovers to visit, but it is also one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the united Kingdom, meaning that there is something for everyone to enjoy here. Dating from the 1970s, Manchester is home to a large Chinatown that has some of the best Chinese food in the country, and there is also the famous LGBT part of town that centres around Canal Street, known as ‘The Village’, one of the largest established gay communities in Europe. If you want to try Indian food, more popular in the United Kingdom now than fish and chips, then you will love the Curry Mile, a line of Indian restaurants than spans over 800 metres. "
Llandudno,"Llandudno’s claim to fame is that it is the largest seaside resort in Wales and with this in mind come here to experiences rugged beaches along the North Shore and Llandudno Bay. As you would imagine there are a wealth of seaside pursuits to enjoy such as Llandudno Pier that features all the traditional seaside games like arcade games and fairground rides, as well as shops and stalls that sell Welsh seaside snacks. If you want to go on a historic walk through the city then you can follow a tour known as the Town Trail, or if you prefer the more contemporary side if things you can head for the main artery of Mostyn Street for shopping and dining options aplenty. "
Belfast City Hall,"The capital city of Northern Island, Belfast has a long and proud history that means that there are a wealth of activities for visitors to enjoy here. To learn all about this history and culture you can head to the Cathedral Quarter where you can wander around to your heart’s content, or simply stroll along the cobblestone streets that line this city as you take in the atmosphere. Not be missed is a trip to a local pub to sample the famous black beer, Guinness, that really put Ireland on the map. If you are equally interested in the local food then make sure to try Irish stew. "
Anglesey,"The largest island in Wales, just of the north-west coast, Anglesey is covered in historic places of interest, from unspoilt beaches to quaint period towns. If you head to the town of Beaumaris you will find King Arthur’s Seat and Beaumaris Castle, or you can indulge in some nautical history at the Skerries Lighthouse in Holyhead. For those who enjoy outdoor pursuits then there are hills and mountains aplenty in Anglesey such as Holyhead Mountain, perfect for either short or long hikes. As you are by the sea, check out the aquatic life of this region at the Anglesey Sea Zoo, or if you fancy doing something off the beaten track then head for Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, a village that is said to have the longest name in the whole of the United Kingdom. "
The Cotswolds,"Known for the quaint villages that are spread over the area, many of which are made of honey-coloured stone, visitors flock to the Cotswolds for a slice of traditional British life, and there are parks, inns, traditional pubs, and farms all over this part of the United Kingdom. Farmers markets and orchards are commonly found here if you want to experience the best and freshest of local ingredients, and there is also a strong commitment to arts and crafts. Antique shops and small independent bookstores are well represented, as well as small businesses like bakeries, so you can truly sample the best of British produce here as you explore this rural gem. "
Liverpool,"Designated as the ‘European Capital of Culture’ in 2008, Liverpool is famous for producing a long line of famous British institutions, from the Beatles to Liverpool Football Club, and is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Pier Head Waterfront. Visitors can see a piece of iconic Liverpool at Albert Dock, also home to the Beatles Story Museum, as well as shopping and dining options around the traditional dock area that reminds everyone that Liverpool was a famous harbour and trade area. Often thought of as one of the friendliest cities in the United Kingdom, Liverpool has a mix of traditional features such as cathedrals, museums, and period buildings, as well as a flourishing modern art and music scene, that also includes some excellent nightlife and cutting edge clubs. "
Canterbury Cathedral from above,"Canterbury is perhaps best known for its cathedral, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the famous ‘Canterbury Tales’ by Geoffrey Chaucer, written in the 14th century. There are a huge number of historical places of interest in Canterbury including the remains of the city walls, a castle dating back to Norman times, and St Augustine’s Abbey. The city is small in scale compared to many others in the region, but is still home to an abundance of museums and theatres including the Marlowe Theatre that hosts music, theatre, dance, and stand up performances throughout the year. "
University of Glasgow,"The Scottish city of Glasgow has long been known as an industrial city that is now experiencing something of a resurgence. In recent years Glasgow was designated as the UNESCO City of Music and there are a wealth of performances and concerts on offer here that mix traditional Celtic folk music with the latest local talent. If you are interested in Victorian, Edwardian, Gothic, and medieval architecture then you can check out some of the fine buildings in the city such as the cathedral, the City Chambers, and the Glasgow Cross, or if you are more interested in dining you can try some of the local delicacies such as deep fried foods that include haggis or fish and chips. "
Kpalime,"Palm trees burst from the mud-caked tin shacks and low-lying bungalows of Togo&#8217;s outdoorsy hub. A town set beneath the jungle-dressed ridges of the Plateaux Region, and peppered with German colonial relics and the occasional European-style church spire, it&#8217;s famed for its backcountry and bazaars. The former yields up gushing waterfalls at spots like Tomegbe and Kpoeta, and offers the hiking trails of Mount Agou (the highest in the country). The latter means craft sellers whittling away at Voodoo wood carvings, interesting ceramic creations, mysterious religious trinkets, and – of course – coffee beans, cacao, and tropical fruits. "
Koutammakou,"Hailed as the &#8216;Land of the Batammariba&#8217; by the UNESCO organisation that gave it that coveted World Heritage Site status back in 2004, the Koutammakou of northern Togo is a region of rustic villages built from adobe walls and thatched roofs. The whole area not only offers a glimpse at the traditions of the tribal folk who fled here to avoid capture during the years of the Slave Coast, but also breathtaking vistas of mountain-topped horizons, mud-cracked bushlands, and undulating hills of greenery. You might also see the area listed as the Tamberma Valley – don&#8217;t worry: they are one and the same. "
Lome,"Lome is a throbbing market town that sways to the beat of African drums and the rhythm of endless markets. Founded in the 1800s by German and other European traders, it still has its mercantile character – just look to the ports, where endless depots of cocoa and palm products and even oil are loaded onto tankers. However, today, the concrete jungle is balanced out by the earthy tribal pull of Voodoo. This mesmerises buyers in the sprawling fetish stalls and talisman emporiums of the city&#8217;s folk market, and bursts from the explorative exhibitions of the Togo National Museum. Also, don&#8217;t miss the Grand Marche: a massive local bazaar set over three floors. "
Togoville,"Rarely does a city bless a country with its name, and even rarer is it for just a small clutch of Voodoo shrines and mud brick huts to inspire the moniker for the entire nation. But that&#8217;s precisely what happened here, in the small town of Togo (as it was known then). Back in 1884, the expeditionary Nachtigal signed an agreement with the chieftain of the land for German hegemony to extend to this part of West Africa. Today, visitors can still see copies of the interesting document, providing they ask the tribal leader nicely! Other draws include a pretty colonial cathedral and a series of little beaches along the lakeshore for strolling. "
Agbodrafo,"The second town on the banks of Lake Togo that&#8217;s worth a visit, Agbodrafo is known for its popular resort hotel: The Hotel le Lac. This luxurious medley of shimmering al fresco pools and sunning terraces buts up right to the water&#8217;s edge, offering guests a luxurious stay on the side of the country&#8217;s famous lagoon. The town itself is also known for its proliferation of watersports, and it&#8217;s possible to organise everything from pedal boating to jet skiing out on the surface. On the other side of the town, to the south, is the Atlantic Ocean, complete with its rolling waves and stretches of sand. "
Aneho,"Salt-washed canoes line the sandy shore of Aneho; Aneho that was once the capital of German Togo; Aneho that once boomed with the money and dubious merchandise of slave traders from across Africa and Europe alike. Yep, today the erstwhile kingpin of the colonial age here is now just a sleepy little fishing village, relying heavily on the fruits of the Atlantic to feed its clutch of locals. And talking of the locals, they are earthy and interesting people who still have a deep zeal for the national Voodoo faith. Despite that, there&#8217;s also a duo of churches and some Christian shrines to see. "
Fazao Malfakassa National Park,"Togo&#8217;s largest national park sits smack bang in the heart of the nation. It encompasses nearly 2,000 square kilometers, and is famed for its thick forests and riparian woodlands. The piece de resistance, and much of the reason the park was first established back in the 1970s, is the presence of the uber-rare forest elephant. Unfortunately, populations of the great beast have been significantly reduced due to illegal poaching in the area, but conservation efforts are underway, and there are also bay duiker and antelopes, kobs and bushbuck, to keep safari goers searching between the trees. "
Keran National Park,"Going all the way back to 1971, the riparian habitats that clutch the gushing courses of the Kamongou River in the northern part of Togo are now protected by the Keran National Park. Over the decades, the whole reserve has been continuously expanded and added to, giving it a diversity of environments that range from swamplands to rocky escarpments. The main draw are the elephants, which can be seen lining the watersides throughout the day. However, there are also loads of bushbuck and antelopes to boot. Oddly, the Keran National Park is more accessible from neighboring Ghana than from Togo&#8217;s capital at Lome, which sits on the coast more than 500 kilometers to the south! "
Fosse aux Lions National Park,"Perhaps the least-visited of all of Togo&#8217;s national parks, the protected region of the Fosse aux Lions lies the farthest north of all. Apart from the mysterious mud-brick towns of Koutammakou, it&#8217;s the main draw of the Savanes Region: a patchwork of savannah and muddy swamplands, mires and acacia-dotted plains that plays host to elephants (even if the local numbers of West Africa&#8217;s largest mammal have decreased considerably in recent times). Unusually, the lands of Fosse aux Lions totally encompass the rustic town of Tandjouare, which is one of the top bases for hiking and game journeys here. "
Sokode,"The great hub of the Centrale river lands, Sokode is crisscrossed by the courses of the Mono and the Mo, while its backcountry is irrigated by the channels of the meandering Kpondjo, Kpandi, and the Na. And if that&#8217;s one too many rivers for you, just look at what the locals have carved out of the land using the lifeblood brought by the waters of the faraway hills: corn; yams; soy; cassava – the list goes on! It&#8217;s hardly a wonder that the main attraction is the indelible character of the farming locals. Add to that the fascinating rituals of the Semassi warriors during the Kotokoli festival, and it&#8217;s easy to see why intrepid travelers love coming to this corner of Togo. "
Kara,"A long 400-kilometer drive from the capital of Lome, the far-flung town of Kara can be found clutching the edge of the winding Haugeau River. Home to nearly 100,000 people, it&#8217;s actually one of the largest towns in the country, and has a bustling marketplace (with Voodoo trinkets and farmers&#8217; goods aplenty) to match. Kara is primarily a good stopover on the way to the great national parks (Fosse aux Lions and Keran) and UNESCO regions of northern Togo, but also figures a crossroads between Benin in the east and Ghana in the west. "
Bassar,"Taste the fufu yams of Bassar and you&#8217;ll never want to leave – at least, that&#8217;s what the locals might tell you in this agricultural kingpin of the Kara Region, central Togo. Yep, there&#8217;s rarely a place where the main draw is the type of yam produced in the surrounding fields. But then again, there&#8217;s rarely a yam as popular in the national kitchen as the labaco type grown in Bassar. Of course, that&#8217;s not it! You can also meet Voodoo locals, and tour the haunting so-called House of the Dead, which honors the tribal chieftains of old. You&#8217;ll see ritual sacrifices of goats and other livestock here, as well as fascinating cultural processions. "
Hospital of Hope,"50,000-strong Mango is a dusty town surrounded by the sweeping savannahs of the (appropriately-named) Savanes Region in northern Togo. It&#8217;s a place of hard-working villagers and zealous mosque-goers, all bolstered by the presence of the Keran National Park, and by trade links across to Ghana thanks to the border in the west. Sat on the main north-south road that heads into the far reaches of the country from Lome, it’s a fine stopover for those seeking the mysteries of the Koutammakou UNESCO site. Mango is also the home of the so-called Hospital of Hope: a Christian health mission that&#8217;s new to the area. "
Atakpame,"In ages gone by, the small town of Atakpame and its little basin in the midst of the impossibly green Atakora Mountain was the site of an awesome battle. It saw the forces of two of West Africa&#8217;s greatest empires – the Oyo and the Ashanti – clash, with mercenaries and fighters from countless tribal groups in the region joining in the fight. Today, more than 300 years on, there&#8217;s little trace of the same violence, and Atakpame is a pleasant stronghold of the native Yoruba folk. Visitors can expect traditional markets, plenty of trade, and access to the verdant mountains on the horizon. "
Tsevie,"One of the main producers of palm oil and centers for palm oil processing in Togo, Tsevie is an industrial place at heart. That also means it&#8217;s a lived-in, modern town, with bustling locals and an energetic character. You&#8217;ll find colourful brick-built churches rubbing shoulders with thatched and adobe yurt houses. You&#8217;ll see dance festivals erupt in the streets during religious holiday times. And – most importantly for the intrepid travelers out there – you&#8217;ll be able to organize hiking excursions and explorations out to the Foret d&#8217; Lili and the wider Maritime Region. "
El Djem,"It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this for fans of the ancients. Colossal arches and elliptical amphitheaters to rival even the Colosseum in Rome are what mark the horizon of famous El Djem. Tagged by UNESCO, the city is a modern one built right atop an old one, with the occasional ruin of Roman homes and arcades popping up on the corners. Many sights have been preserved thanks to the billowing dust storms of the surrounding Sahara, but a lack of large-scale archaeology means that the main attraction remains the huge Amphitheatre of Thysdrus. Delve in and stroll the changing rooms of gladiators, or stand where ancient governors once did atop the fighting pits. "
Houmt Souk,"The undisputed jewel of Djerba island comes topped with the adobe domes of the Bordj el Kabir fort, which was raised in the 1400s and 1500s to protect the harbor on the Gulf of Gabes below. Over the centuries, everyone from the Numidians to the Arabs to the Spaniards to the Ottomans have made their home in this tactical position on the edge of the Med. Accordingly, history oozes from every dust-caked pore. There are the traditional fondouks quarters of medieval merchants left in the Old Town. There colorful pottery bazaars, whitewashed synagogues, Turkic mosques, and lively marketplaces selling olive oils and chickpea broths. "
Sousse,"Still reeling from the horrific terror attacks of 2015, the seaside city of Sousse is now much less loud about its beauties. But the beauties are there nonetheless. They lurk between the tight-knit alleyways of the town&#8217;s historic medina; they ooze from the simple and elegant rises of the Aghlabite Great Mosque; they beckon from the formidable bulwarks of the old Ribat citadel above the place. And away from the steaming Ottoman hammams and colorful Maghreb souks of the town proper, there are gorgeous beaches that sparkle turquoise blue, all fringed with luxurious hotels and palm-lined promenades. "
Sidi Bou Said,"You could be forgiven for thinking that you&#8217;d made the hop across the Med to the islands of the Greek Aegean as you enter the vibrant interior of Sidi Bou Said town, sat just 20 kilometers from bustling Tunis. Yep, the sky-blue and whitewashed color scheme here is more than reminiscent of towns in Santorini and Mykonos. However, this one&#8217;s interesting hues were actually started by the French musicologist Rodolphe d&#8217;Erlanger. He first plastered the stucco walls of his home with the endearing tones in the 20s, and his palatial mansion at the Ennejma Ezzahra is a now a museum to his legacy. "
Tozeur,"Every trip to Tunisia should include a jaunt to the great desert of the Sahara, whose shifting sands and dry escarpments begin here in earnest. And where better for a taste of the dry life than the adobe mud town of Tozeur? This oases settlement in the extreme south-west of the nation is a veritable masterpiece of Berber tradition. For starters, it&#8217;s surrounded by swathes of verdant date palm blooms that rise straight from the ochre-hued earth. And then there&#8217;s its medina city, with filigrees and carvings and brick artistry straight from the old arabesque world. "
Tunis,"Pass under the great arches of the Bab el Bhar (the Port de France) and you&#8217;ll see both sides to this fascinating capital: the French side and the Maghreb side. In the former, the so-called Ville Nouvelle, the traces of rule from Paris are all too evident. There are wide, tree-peppered avenues. There are coffee shops spilling onto the sidewalks. There are grand cathedrals with Gothic elements. And on the latter side of town; the African side, things take a turn for the arabesque. Lively souks packed with kaleidoscopic fabrics crawl and sprawl over one another. The shouts of hawkers touting spice echo, and the scents of tagines and mint teas mix with camel skin lamps and shisha pipes. "
Great Mosque of Kairouan,"Nearly 1,500 years of history meets between the dust-caked desert hills around Kairouan. A city famed for its long connection to the Islamic world, it&#8217;s been a center of Sunni teachings since at least the 7th century. Cue the mighty rises of the Great Mosque of Kairouan: a UNESCO World Heritage Site that draws thousands of pilgrims to its prayer rooms and enclosures each year. Once you’ve wondered at that amazing Aghlabid relic, be sure to wander the old medina and its whitewashed cottages, taste sweet Tunisian pastries in the bakeries there, and seek out the interesting Mosque of the Three Gates. "
Monastir Ribat,"Most people will know Monastir for the great citadel fortress that bears its moniker. And it&#8217;s true that the Monastir Ribat, topped with its crenulated parapets and red stone bulwarks, is unquestionably the major attraction in town. (After all, it was one of the filming locations in the hit film Monty Python&#8217;s The Life of Brian). However, there are other things to see and do here, like trace the Muslim influence at sites like the Mausoleum of Bourguiba, or wonder up at the colossal city mosque (dating from the 1000s no less!). "
Dougga,"UNESCO World Heritage fame marks the crumbling peristyles and age-cracked temples of Dougga out from many of North Africa&#8217;s other mighty ancient sites. Once Roman, the remains of the entire city here are considered some of the best-preserved in the region. Travelers come to gawp at the looming Doric columns of the Dougga Theatre, standing tall over the green fields of the Beja Governorate. They come to walk the old cobbled Roman roads, or to see the relics of shrines to Jupiter and the Imperial Cult. There are also bathhouses, soaring mausoleums, and in-tact sewer systems to encounter. "
Carthage,"The very name of Carthage evokes romantic tales of Greek seafarers, figures like Aeneas and Dido from the heroic age, and stories of mighty battles on the Alps and Mediterranean Seas. That all makes it easy to see why this sprawling ruined site just outside of Tunis is one of the most-visited attractions in all of Tunisia. However, the centuries of Punic wars and Muslim invasions have left it abandoned more than once, and the remains of Carthage are not as awe-inspiring as some of the country&#8217;s other Roman treats. It&#8217;s worth coming though, if only to stand where great generals in the ilk of Hannibal once did! "
Sfax,"It&#8217;s hard not to be taken by the elegance of Sfax. Old and eclectic, it bears all the hallmarks you&#8217;d expect of a city trodden by Sicilian kings and Spanish invaders, Barbary pirates and Ottoman imperialists. Moorish traits pockmark the old Kasbah, mingling with Rococo and colonial elements, while the great city walls look like something plucked straight out of Aladdin. Meanwhile, the gorgeous Place de la Republique is trotted by horses and carts, and the Sfax War Cemetery is a sobering reminder of the great struggles that occurred in North Africa between Allied and Axis forces during the 20th century. "
Douz,"It&#8217;s just a stone&#8217;s throw from Douz to the sweeping sand plains of the Jebil National Park – one of the great natural treasures of southern Tunisia. So, it&#8217;s not for nothing that this far-flung town in the south is considered the gateway to the Sahara. It&#8217;s home to purring camels, and weathered Berber tour guides who are eager to lead expeditions on humpback into the scorched wilds. It&#8217;s worth getting in the saddle and following them, because wonders like the salt flats of Chott al-Jerid and the shifting Grand Erg await there! "
Hammamet,"Hammamet sits on the southern bends of the Cap Bon, enjoying the lapping waves and soothing salt-packed breezes of the Mediterranean Sea. The town magnetizes visitors with its enchanting appearance, which comes as a curious mélange of Spanish, Sicilian and Castilian architecture, all balanced out by the ubiquitous Maghreb medina town of whitewashed adobe homes and palm-sprouting streets. However, it&#8217;s the beaches here that really take the biscuit. Head down to sun-kissed Hammamet Sud, where loungers meet jet skis meet sunbathers meet SCUBA outfitters. "
Zarzis,"Palm-peppered Zarzis (also spelled Jarjis) is a place that proudly touts its fringing of shimmering beaches and resorts. Lined up all along the Mediterranean to the north and south of town, they are amongst the most popular of destinations for package holidayers in search of Tunisia&#8217;s medley of sun, sand, sea, and unrelenting desert heat. The town itself is a modern, built-up place that hides the centuries of Roman and Arabic history beneath. You&#8217;ll see grand mosques looming above the street corners, the occasional olive oil seller, and whitewashed villas shrouded by oases. "
Matmata,"Matmata entered the field of public attention when it became the home of a certain Luke Skywalker in the stories of Star Wars way back in 1976. In fact, the spot is one of many in a long line of filming locations found throughout Tunisia, but might just be the most famous. The backdrop for the iconic lands of Tatooine were the interesting troglodyte houses of the locals here, which are carved straight into the dusty earth and painted white to reflect the sun. You can still see them, along with other cool examples of cave dwellings in the dusty surrounds of Gabes. "
Florence,"Florence is the jewel of the Renaissance and is renowned worldwide for its contribution to the arts and culture of modern society. During the Middle Ages Florence was one of the most important cities in the world and gave birth to legends such as Da Vinci and Michelangelo. Today Florence is a thriving city with a dazzling amount of attractions. The Duomo and Baptistery are simply magnificent with their polychrome faces. The Ponte Vecchio spanning the Arno River is intriguing with its array of shops and stalls. The Piazza della Signoria contains the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, the Galleria dell’Accademia and the opulent fountain of Neptune. Every corner of this city is packed full of interesting sites of historical significance. "
Pisa,"Second only to Florence in terms of significance during the Renaissance, Pisa is another stunning city with a great deal to offer on the eastern coast of Tuscany. Pisa is known throughout the world for its iconic leaning tower – this campanille is actually part of a larger complex that contains the Duomo di Pisa, the baptistery and the monumental cemetery. Each structure is awe inspiring in its own right; the bell tower is just the icing on the cake. Pisa also has several interesting museums, a fantastic botanical gardens and some spectacular scenery along the Arno River. You may come for the leaning tower, but you will leave having seen so much more. "
Lucca,"Many people overlook this smaller Tuscan city, but Lucca played an important role in Italy during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. This city lies in close proximity to Pisa and contains a myriad of beautiful buildings. A main feature of Lucca is the complete city wall complex that encircles the whole historic old town – these walls are truly magnificent and the parkland that is maintained around them is a pleasure to explore. Lucca also features the glorious Duomo that features an immense bell tower and has a highly decorated façade. Other attractions of note include the Torre delle Ore, Guinigi Tower, San Michele in Foro and the Museum of Villa Mansi. This variety of historical sites make Lucca an attractive destination within the Tuscany region. "
Arezzo,"Arezzo is one of the most central cities in Tuscany and lies in-between the Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts equally. The city is situated on a hillside and the upper section contains the historic old town, whilst the lower section is modern and concerned with industry and trade. The old town is the main area of interest and contains some beautiful structures such as the Fortezza Medicea, the Duomo San Donato and the Teatro Petrarca. If you are interested in museums and history, Arezzo also has several high quality establishments including the Museo Archeologico Mecenate and the Museum of Medieval and Modern Art. Finally, Arezzo has some amazing parks and places of natural beauty for those who love the outdoors. "

Aside from the port and the canals, Livorno also has some impressive attractions such as the Mercato Centrale, the Piazza della Repubblica and the Terrazza Mascagni. "
Pistoia,"Pistoia is located in close proximity to both Florence and Pisa but it ha a great deal to offer as a standalone tourist destination. This city has the distinction of being the birthplace of the pistol firearm and was an important location during the Middle Ages. Some of the most popular and documented sites include the Cathedral of St. Zeno and its Baptistery, the complex of San Giovanni Fuorcivitas, the Museo Capitolare and Pistoia Zoo. Furthermore, Pistoia is surrounded by some amazing mountain towns such as the spa town Montecatini Terme and the beautiful town of Montecatini Alto. Finally, for those who seek adventure, there is always the immense Monte Cimone mountain range waiting to be conquered. "
Prato,"Prato has been an influential city for many hundreds of years and was once one of the largest textile manufacturers in the country. Today it is a fine tourist destination and has a great deal to offer in central Tuscany. The Duomo di Prato and Emperors Castle are two significant structures that are definitely worth a visit. Additionally to take a look at the cities manufacturing past, the Textile Museum offers keen insight and is an interesting museum. Whilst in Prato, you must try the famous Biscotti biscuit and the cured Mortadella Salumi &#8211; these two delicacies are simply divine and two of Prato&#8217;s finest creations. For the adventurous, Prato has many cycling routes and some gorgeous surrounding countryside. "
Montepulciano,"This small town located in close proximity to Siena is a true hidden gem and is one of the best kept secrets in Tuscany. You can find Montepulciano 600m high on an ancient limestone ridge and the views from this town of the surrounding countryside are to die for. Aside from the jaw dropping views, this town also has some fantastic medieval architecture such as the Palazzo Cervini, the Torre di Pulcinella, the Porta al Prato and the Chiesa di San Biagio. The main square is charming, and the surrounding fields are covered with vineyards producing the famous Vino Nobile. "

The whole region is a protected area and contains a historic heritage railway, a huge array if expansive vineyards and some peaceful towns such as Pienza, Radicofani and Montalcino.

This whole region is waiting to be explored and offers much in terms of sight-seeing and outdoor pursuits. "
Elba Island,"Elba is possibly best known for being the island to which Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled after his forced abdication in 1814.

Aside from the breath-taking architecture, the city has a plethora of museums and the narrow cobbled streets are simply perfect to amble through. "
Grosseto,"Grosseto may not be as popular as Florence or Pisa but it holds a plethora of interesting sites and historical structures and is an amazing place to visit in the southern part of Tuscany. The main draw of this city is the historic old town centre – much of the original city walls still stand, as do several defensive bastions – these structures encircle the historic town centre and create a clear divide between the old and new. Within the town centre you can find some interesting sites such as the Duomo di Grosseto, the Porta Corsica, the Bastione Cavallerizza and the Aldobrandeschi Palace.

"St Mary&#8217;s Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne","Like many industrial cities in the north of England Newcastle had to find its feet once more following the sudden decline of heavy industry. The city had been a hub for coal mining, manufacturing and shipping, but has repositioned itself as both a centre for scientific research and a carefree place for nights out. Standing proud since 1928 is the arch of the Tyne Bridge, one of those universally-recognised landmarks and an enduring symbol for Tyneside. There&#8217;s no shortage of museums, art galleries, theatres and live music venues, as well as a sleeping giant of a football team, Newcastle United at the cathedral-like St James&#8217; Park. And right in the centre is the medieval Castle keep where the city began, first built by William the Conqueror&#8217;s son. "
Quayside,"Newcastle (north bank)and Gateshead (south) share the Tyne River, and at the Quayside you&#8217;ll get a handle on Tyneside in the 21st-century. Until the last decades of the 20th-century this section of riverside, east of the Tyne Bridge, was an industrial nerve centre, with warehouses and busy wharfs by the water. Later the area became derelict but has been revitalised and has now become a destination for nights out and culture, and a nice spot for a waterfront walk. A symbol for this rebirth is the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, completed in 2001. It provides a crossing for cyclists and pedestrians and then tilts on an axis at set times to allow river traffic to pass. "
Grainger Town,"Named after the 19th-century city planner Richard Grainger, this imposing central district of Newcastle was entirely redeveloped in the neoclassical style between 1824 and 1849. There are 29 Grade I buildings in the space of just a few streets, all now encompassed by a conservation area. Grey Street is surely the grandest of them all, possessing the Theatre Royal and its spectacular portico, as well as the elegant Edwardian shopping gallery, the Central Arcade. Grainger Market meanwhile is shopping heaven, with family-run stalls, eateries and high street shops under a wrought iron and glass roof. "
"Hylton Castle, Sunderland","A few miles down the road Sunderland shares a (usually) friendly rivalry with Newcastle. Sunderland has also had to find a new direction after shining as one of England&#8217;s great shipyards from the 14th century onwards. This industry went the way of glassmaking and coal mining, but hi-tech industry and services took their place from the 90s onwards. You can delve into the old glassmaking trade at the National Glass Centre, see more than 2,000 plant species at the Winter Gardens and catch a Premier League game at the Stadium of Light. At any time of year, get down to the seafront where the once grim beaches at Roker and Seaburn now earn the Blue Flag for their cleanliness. "
"Angel of the North, Gateshead","The last 20 years have given Gateshead some breathtaking monuments. The headliner has to be the emblematic and much-loved Angel of the North, a 20-metre high steel sculpture created by Antony Gormley and installed on a hall over Birtley a few minutes south of Gateshead. On the Tyne is the Norman Foster-designed Sage Gateshead, a thrilling concert venue added in 2004 the place to watch touring rock and pop artists. The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art is a converted flour mill; art-wise the museum&#8217;s temporary exhibitions are great, and the view of Newcastle from the platform at the top should put it firmly on your itinerary. "
Tynemouth,"This handsome town is on the northern bank of the Tyne as it enters the north sea. In Georgian and Victorian times it was a home for wealthy ship-owners, merchants and industrialists, so there&#8217;s a lot of lovely property from the 1700s and 1800s. The maritime scenery is wonderfully moody in winter, while on warmer days visitors from Newcastle flock to King Edward&#8217;s Bay and Tynemouth Longsands for some seaside R&amp;R. Tynemouth Pier is a breakwater at the mouth of the river, pushing out to the North Sea for more than 800 metres. You can walk the length to get a better sight of the lighthouse, which was built in 1864. Pop into the still-thriving Tynemouth Market and explore Tynemouth Priory, which was founded in the 600s. "
Arbeia Roman Fort,"Opposite Tynemouth, on the south bank of the Tyne, South Shields is a coastal town with bracing North Sea beaches, landscaped parkland on its foreshore and thrilling pieces of history here and there. Arbeia is a Roman Fort that received supplies for Hadrian&#8217;s Wall, and the gatehouse, house of the commanding officer and barracks have all been faithfully rebuilt on the original foundations. Marsden Beach a little down the way is stunning, with limitless sands and powerful cliffs. And Souter Lighthouse, constructed in 1871, was the first AC-powered lighthouse in the world and is now open to the public as a National Trust monument. "
Wallsend,"East of Newcastle, Wallsend was one of England&#8217;s ship-building capitals in the steam age, launching RMS Mauretania, which broke the record for the quickest eastbound Atlantic crossing in 1907. Although no vessels are now built at the massive Swan Hunter, the yard is still used to service North Sea oil and gas rigs. The name &#8220;Wallsend&#8221; tells you that it was the eastern end of Hadrian&#8217;s Wall in Roman Times. For the uninitiated, this wall spanned northern England and sealed off the border to the unconquered territories in what is now mostly Scotland. The foundations of the fort constructed to protect the east side of the wall can be viewed from a raised platform at Segedunum, and there&#8217;s a museum with some Roman military artefacts discovered in excavations in the 1990s. "
"St. Paul&#8217;s, Jarrow","Also boasting shipyards, Jarrow launched warships for the Royal Navy in the Victorian era and early-20th century. In front of the town hall there&#8217;s a statue of Charles Palmer, a 19th-century shipbuilder and later an MP for Jarrow. Also in the town centre is a monument for the Jarrow March, which took place in 1936 during the Great Depression when 200 laid-off workers from the shut-down Palmer&#8217;s Shipyard walked from Jarrow to London to deliver a petition to parliament. But Jarrow&#8217;s most influential resident has to be the Venerable Bede,  an 8th-century monk at St Paul&#8217;s Abbey (also visitable) who translated Christian Latin and Greek texts into Anglo-Saxon and so had a lasting impact on the English language. There&#8217;s a museum dedicated to Bede in the grounds of Jarrow Hall, featuring a reconstructed Anglo-Saxon farm. "
Washington Hall,"Did you know that George Washington&#8217;s ancestral home is on Wearside? Washington Hall is a beautiful historic manor house run by the National Trust. Entry times are restricted, but if you&#8217;re in the area there&#8217;s a relic of the region&#8217;s mining history to see. The Washington F Pit has a Victorian engine house and an impressive horizontal winding engine that used to run on steam. It&#8217;s all part of the Washington &#8216;F&#8217; Pit Museum, which normally opens on Saturdays. Washington used to have an RAF Base at Usworth, which has been taken over by the North East Aircraft Museum, featuring 30 de Havilland, Avro, Hawker and Westland Aircraft, together with a cool range of Rolls-Royce propeller and jet engines. "
High Lights &amp; Low Lights North Shields,"Facing its southern counterpart, North Shields is right on the mouth of the River Tyne and in old times had an important job to keep ships out of trouble. At high tide the rocks, the Black Middens are submerged and for centuries they caused innumerable shipwrecks. To try to remedy this problem &#8220;High and Low Lights&#8221; were built nearby above Fish Quay in the 16th-century and navigators could use these beacons to enter the Tyne safely. The High Light and Low Light we see now date to the 1700s and are both listed buildings. Long after the beacons have been removed boats still use these whitewashed towers as daymarks to get into the Tyne. "
St Mary&#8217;s Lighthouse &#8211; Whitley Bay,"Only ten miles from Newcastle, Whitley Bay is an old-school seaside resort that came to the fore in the 19th century. You have a long and broad sandy beach to wander past, backed by a promenade with lovely vistas up to St Mary&#8217;s Lighthouse to the north. At the upper end is an excellent links golf course, and if you keep going along the seafront you&#8217;ll come to the lighthouse, which is linked to the mainland via a concrete causeway you can cross at low tide. St Mary&#8217;s Lighthouse is now out of action, but has been kept as a museum and there&#8217;s also a cafe on the tidal island here. "
Whitburn,"Between South Shields and Sunderland, Whitburn is a village that may catch you off-guard with its rural character, even though it&#8217;s at the centre of a huge conurbation. There are no big landmarks demanding your attention; instead you can just soak up the peace on the tree-lined lanes which have gorgeous 18th-century townhouses and timber cottages. There&#8217;s a local cricket club if you&#8217;d like to while away a sunny afternoon watching a match, or you could saunter up to the Whitburn Windmill, which is on pasture facing the North Sea and dates to the 1700s. "
Houghton-le-Spring &#8211; Penshaw Monument,"Much like the Angel of the North the hilltop Penshaw Monument is visible from a great distance and is a valued fixture on the landscape. This folly on Penshaw Hill was built in 1844 in honour of John Lambton, who was the 1st Early of Durham and MP for County Durham, which also included all of Tyne and Wear until the 20th century. Another excuse to come down to Houghton-le-Spring is for the local parkland: Herrington Country Park is great for families and dog-walkers, and you could also sneak in a round at the 18-hole Houghton-le-Spring Golf Club. "
"Church of St Peter, Monkwearmouth","In the time of the Venerable Bede, St Paul&#8217;s Abbey in Jarrow and St Peter&#8217;s Abbey in Monkwearmouth were part of the same monastery despite being in locations several miles apart. Monkwearmouth was one of the first three settlements on the River Wear, and like most places on the English coast was terrorised by Viking raids all through the 8th and 9th centuries. The main thing to see is St Peter&#8217;s Church, which belonged to the abbey and is one of the oldest churches in the country, integrating the  original 7th century porch but with later Norman additions. "
Gaddafi National Mosque,"The ancestral capital of the Buganda kingdom is modern day Uganda&#8217;s capital too. And for an African first city, it&#8217;s got real charm and panache. You can still see some of the thatched relics of the former glory years at the Kasubi Tombs, or you can taste the frenetic energy of day-to-day Ugandan life between the sun-cracked streets of Central Kampala; a place of throbbing markets (the city&#8217;s Owino market is said to be the largest in Central-east Africa) and echoing mosque minarets (that soaring Gaddafi National Mosque is a must!). On the edge of town is the more straight-laced area of Nakasero Hill, where well-to-do villas house the country&#8217;s elite and expats chatter in the ramshackle bars. "
Kibale National Park,"Pierce into the dense jungles and wetland forests of the great Kibale National Park and you won&#8217;t be disappointed! What awaits is one of the world&#8217;s most awesome arrays of wild chimpanzee packs, and you can see these majestic simians of Central Africa trawling through the undergrowth and commanding the canopies on game drives and safari excursions of all different types. There&#8217;s a kaleidoscope of other curious little monkeys to spot too, like the rare L’Hoest’s and the Ugandan red colobus. It&#8217;s also possible to wonder up at ancient fig trees, and see some more recent efforts to create sustainable coffee plantations in the area. "
Ssese Islands,"A cocktail of golden sands worthy of Latin America, sun-kissed beaches and lapping waves, the archipelago of the Ssese Islands is Uganda&#8217;s answer to the tropical gems of the East African coast on the Indian Ocean. Peppering the waters of Lake Victoria, they are considered the country&#8217;s premier rest and relaxation spot, with the popular Buggala Island and Bulago coming up top of the menu. You can either kick-back in one of the lakeside resorts, or wax up the walking boots and make for the hills, where hippo-dotted swamps hide between the ridges. Kayaks and other watersports are also available on Buggala. "
Bwindi Impenetrable National Park,"The Bwindi Impenetrable National Park really does live up to its name! A land of rocky peaks and endless green, it&#8217;s covered in some of Africa&#8217;s oldest primeval forestry. The biodiversity – think geckos next to gorillas next to a multitude of curious insects – garnered the spot a UNESCO World Heritage tag, while most safari goers head this way in search of colobus monkeys and chimpanzees. The breathtaking landscapes are typical of the Albertine Rift. They rise and fall to untrodden valleys and summits, with quartzite massifs here and teak-shrouded riverways there. It&#8217;s definitely one to write home about! "
Murchison Falls National Park,"Named for the roaring cataracts that carve right through their middle, the wilds of the Murchison Falls National Park are unquestionably some of the most amazing in north-western Uganda. The protected area is actually the largest national park in the country, with a whopping count of nearly 4,000 square kilometers between its borders. The biggest attraction is – of course – the point where the Victoria Nile crashes through a tight-knit gorge and over an escarpment of more than 40 meters in height. However, travelers can also look forward to stalking lions and giraffes and elephants and more! "
Entebbe,"Entebbe, for most international visitors at least, will be the entrance point to Uganda. It&#8217;s here that the nation&#8217;s Entebbe International Airport makes its home; its runways butting up against the waters of Lake Victoria. Most will also leave promptly, on their way to Kampala or the country&#8217;s other far-flung safari destinations. Those who linger can enjoy a laid-back place that still trundles to the tune of the old British Protectorate – for it&#8217;s here that the English colonists made their base in earlier decades. One of the relics of that age is the beautiful National Botanical Gardens, while there are also charming churches, and the official residence of the president: the Ugandan State House. "
Queen Elizabeth National Park,"Handily named just QENP for short, this huge dash of wilderness that lies close to the banks of Lake Edward and the DRC border in the west is Uganda&#8217;s most famous national park. It&#8217;s visited by thousands of tourists each year, who come in search of the lazy Congo lions and the swinging chimps that can be seen mingling between the Maramagambo Forest and the grassy savannah. The whole area is also scarred by countless volcanic features, going from the awesome Katwe craters to great rifts in the earth, making it an interesting and eye-catching place to go on safari drives and game seeking journeys. "
Mount Elgon National Park,"The rock-ribbed, jungle-topped highlands of the Mount Elgon National Park are peppered with so many natural beauties it can be difficult to describe them all at once. Cascading down from the extinct caldera of one of Africa&#8217;s oldest volcanos, there are waterfalls, dank cave systems, and rugged canyons aplenty. Visitors can also feel the geothermal activity at a series of hot springs, or wonder upwards, to where African goshawks and elegant bush-shrikes flit through the skies. Monkey wise, there are the likes of De Brazza’s and colobuses, along with blue monkeys and some other rare simian species. "
Mbale,"One of the main transportation and administration hubs of eastern Uganda, tin-shack Mbale hosts its own regional government and a clutch of good hotels and guesthouses. It&#8217;s particularly useful for those on their way to the heights of Mount Elgon and the famous summit of Wagagai – a 24-million-year-old volcano that is the seventeenth highest in all of Africa. (For the best base of explorations around the hiking trails and glorious mountain&#8217;s that erupt around Mbale, be sure to hitch a local minibus out to Bududa.) Back in the town itself and you can enjoy the hustle and bustle of day-to-day Ugandan life, along with plenty of shops and market stalls. "
Lake Mburo National Park,"Despite being one of the smallest national parks in Uganda, the swaying savannah grasses and riparian habitats of Lake Mburo certainly pack a punch. They come spotted with buffalo herds and zebras, crossed by prancing reedbucks, and stalked with hyenas. Today, much of the area is clad in young forestry, which springs up from the swamplands that dominate along the shores of the eponymous lake. These make for great game viewing during the dry season, when the animals congregate at the watering holes. What&#8217;s more, Lake Mburo National Park is one of the most accessible going, with easy access along the highway from Kampala, the capital. "
Mgahinga Gorilla National Park,"You&#8217;ll have to go to the far southern depths of Uganda to find the great galumphing beasts of the highlands: mountain gorillas. The appropriately-named Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is one of the top places to find them too, with its indelibly green rainforests falling down from the windswept heights of cloud-shrouded volcanos. The area buts up to the famous Virunga Range, and offers game sightings of rare mountain gorillas alongside other awesome creatures – think woodland elephants, golden monkeys, wild hogs and jackals. Yep, you can see them in the DRC too, but things here just happen to be a little safer! "
Kidepo Valley National Park,"Hidden away in the northern reaches of Uganda (in one of the more dubious and unsafe parts of the country), the Kidepo Valley National Park is a great fly-in visit. It&#8217;s sat a whopping 700 kilometers from the capital, and is known for its remoteness. Totally undeveloped and untouched by mass safari tourism, the region is the old stomping ground of the Dodoth pastoralists. These semi-nomads shared the landscapes of savannah and mud plain with oodles of buffalo, hippo, oryx and wild dogs, which can still be seen flitting between the grey-haired acacia groves and wetlands today. "
Jinja,"It&#8217;s just a short drive along the highways east to the river town of Jinja, which juts out into the waters where the Victoria Nile emerges from its eponymous lake. Sleepy, sun-cracked and relaxed, the place is the perfect antidote to the energy of life in the capital. It&#8217;s got a clutch of great bars, but is most famed for the wealth of riparian resorts that line the banks. You&#8217;re sure to be able to find something to suit, with everything from pool-peppered boutique hotels to more rustic ecolodges surrounded by monkeys to choose from. And when you do want to get the blood flowing, be sure to head for the whitewater rapids on the river for some rafting! "
Fort Portal,"Still chuffing after the appearance of tarmacked roads in 2007, the regional town of Fort Portal has a truly enviable position beneath the serrated tips of the mighty Rwenzori National Park. Chimps and gorillas tread the backcountry close by, giving the place a real feral feel. However, the center is anything but wild, with human energy dominating the action. There, it&#8217;s all about bustling markets and haggling for local farmer&#8217;s produce. Fort Portal is also a fine base point for launching excursions to the aforementioned Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Lake Edward. "
Lira,"Lira is a little crossroads city in the midst of north-central Uganda. While it&#8217;s actually the fourth-largest in the country, it still manages to retain that charming provincial vibe and sleepiness. Travelers rarely come here too, adding a dash of off-the-beaten-track character and local authenticity. Those who do make their way to Lira&#8217;s streets get to see a real Ugandan city in action, and even get to hear sobering and visceral stories of the ravaging civil wars of former years – this place was hit particularly badly by the onslaught of Joseph Kony and his private army. "
Odesa,"The third largest city in Ukraine, Odesa is a seaport that rest of the shores of the mythical Black Sea. Now an important trade city, visitors gravitate to Odesa for the sandy beaches, clement weather, and sparkling waters, particularly Lanzheron Beach, a perfect place for sun worshippers. Odesa, also referred to as the ‘Pearl of the Black Sea’, may be a large city but its construction gives it an intimate feel, with labyrinthine lanes to navigate as well as nooks and crannies to explore, ending in secluded squares and delightful houses painted in mellow pastel shades. The city’s big claim to fame is the mighty stairway that leads from the centre of town to the beach front, and there are also leafy parks like the City Gardens to enjoy, as well as a bit of culture in the form of the Odesa Opera House and the numerous theatres in the city. "
Poltava,"Poltava, which sits of the Vorskala River, is a city steeped in military history due to a legendary battle in the 18th century between the Cossacks and the Russian Tsar Peter I, and with that in mind come to this city to view the military relics that still remain. These include the Column of Glory, October Park, and the preserved area of the Poltava Battlefield. Poltava is also known for its museums, several of which are dedicated to military history, as well as its main cathedral, the Assumption Cathedral, with its striking belfry. Once the place of such a pivotal moment in history, Poltava is now a relaxed and serene cultural city, with orchestras, theatres, and museums a plenty. "
A park in Myrhorod,"Found on the Khorol River, Myrhorod is essentially a sleepy spa town that became famous due to the mineral properties found in its underground springs. The slightly salty water can be drunk to improve digestive issues, or there are a number of spots where visitors can bathe. If you prefer not to swim then you can take a boat or pedalo out of the Khorol River, and there are a number of quirky features for visitors to Myrhorod to seek out, such as a towering illuminated windmill and a musical water fountain. The woodlands found in the city are also rather famous, and for the full romantic experience you can take a horse drawn carriage ride through the lush landscape. "
Chernihiv,"Sitting neatly on the banks of the Desna River, Chernihiv is often referred to as one of the most ancient cities in all of Ukraine, apparently dating back from the 7th century, making a visit here feel rather like a trip back in time. It is also home to some of the most beautiful buildings in the country, including Catherine’s Church which instantly recognizable due to its golden cupolas. Other religious buildings of note are Pyatnytska Church that sits in the city’s Red Square, the perfect spot for a lazy afternoon stroll around the town center. "
Chernivtsi University,"The city of Chernivtsi that lies at the base of the Carpathian Mountains is most famous for its designated UNESCO World Heritage Site of the former complex of the high priests that is now home to the National University, and was constructed in the Byzantine and Romanesque styles. The architecture of Chernivtsi is said to be similar to that of Vienna, leading to the name ‘Little Vienna’ to describe parts of the city, and many locals point to the relaxed nature of the city which has a strong cafe culture, as well as a range of notable bookshops and book stalls that are said to reflect the intellectual and poetic atmosphere found here. "
Bakota,"The village of Bakota in the Podillia Region is home to the famous cave monastery built by Orthodox monks headed by Saint Anthony of Kiev. The monastery in the underground caves dates from the 12th century and visitors can view well preserved frescoes and paintings as well as remains of some of the monks who lived in the caves. In the present day, Bakota is now part of the National Environmental Park due to its rural location, and features craggy hills on the shores of the picturesque Dniester River. Visitors can ramble in the region and explore the settlement on foot to take in the splendid local flora and fauna on display. "
Uzhhorod,"Uzhhorod, on the border with Slovakia and near the border with Hungary, is a vibrant and diverse town with a sizeable Hungarian and Romanian population that gives it a cosmopolitan feel that has helped to bolster its claim to fame as a premium tourist attraction in Ukraine. Come here for the stunning Uzhhorod Castle that dates from the 9th century, as well as the Greek-Catholic Cathedral from the 17th century. If you want to try some of the local staples then you can explore the city’s famous wine cellars, or try the delicacy bogrács, a kind of goulash originating from neighboring Hungary. "
Kamyanets-Podilskyi Castle,"Kamyanets-Podilskyi, a city in the west of Ukraine, has a long history of immigration and each influence is present in the architecture and culture of the city, including Armenian and Polish markets still found today. The city is awash with ancient monuments such as its castle, cathedral, and crumbling fortifications and, due to its location on the Smotrych River, there are an abundance of outdoor activities for those wanting to do something a little different. Among these are balloon trips over the Smotrych Canyon, as well as race car driving. Also located over the Smotrych River is the Stara Fortetsya, an ancient city fortress that invites visitors to marvel at the preserved ruins. "
Lviv,"The historic centre of the city of Lviv is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and visitors will be able to understand why due to the wealth of monuments and ancient buildings on show here, many of which date back to the 13th century. Aside from the historical jewels on offer here, Lviv is famous for being an artistic hub in Ukraine, and there are galleries all over the city as well as the Lviv National Art Gallery that is said to house over 50,000 works including paintings, sculptures, and art installations. If you enjoy opera or ballet, then Lviv is also famous for its classically trained performers and opulent performances in regular rotation. "
Zhovkva,"Founded in the 16th century, the city of Zhovkva in the west of Ukraine is the place to come if you enjoy marveling at a whole host of historical gems including the Church of Saint Lawrence which is an iconic building in the city due to its domed roof.

Yalta,"Located in one of the regions that forms part of Crimea, Yalta is primarily known for being a laid back resort that faces the Black Sea. There is a long seafront promenade for visitors who want to take in the views over the Crimean Peninsula as well as a zoo and an aquarium that houses dolphins. For even more stunning vies, ride by cable car to the top of the nearby Darsan Hill, and there is also the breathtaking Froros Church that is nestled atop a sea cliff at an elevation of 400 meters. Over the years Yalta has attracted a host of famous figures such as Anton Chekhov and visitors to the area can visit his former home that now serves as a museum. "
Kyiv,"The capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv is most well known for its diverse population, interesting modern architecture, and friendly locals. It also features the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Saint Sophia Cathedral, and although visitors can tour the monastery, it is also still in working order. There are a range of museums to choose from in Kyiv in order to learn more about the local history or culture, or you can check out the latest theatre listings at one of the smaller theatres like the famous Puppet Theatre. This may well be the capital of Ukraine, but it is also an extremely green city featuring not one but two botanical gardens that are perfect for strolling around in the afternoons under the iconic horse chestnut trees that line the roads of Kyiv. "
Slavske,"Slavske, to the southwest of Lviv, is best known as a ski resort, so if you love the snow then this is the place to come. There are cable cars and ski lifts as well as primary slopes for skiers to enjoy, and the season usually runs from approximately November to March. Should you visit in the summer months, there are lots of other activities to enjoy in Slavske such as berry and mushroom picking in the fertile lands, as well as fishing in the surrounding lakes. If you prefer to keep exploring then there are hiking trails as well as horse riding and mountain biking excursions that provide an alternative perspective from which to take in the views. "
Zaporizhia,"Zaporizhia, on the banks of the Dnieper River, is most well known for its quaint islands including the main island of Khortytsia that sits in the middle of the city.

Also on the island is a military museum featuring weaponry and period reconstructions of famous battles. Other small islands found around Zaporizhia are the Rock of the Fool and Pillar Island. "
Vinnytsia,"The city of Vinnytsia lies on the banks of the rather comically named Southern Bug, actually the second longest river in Ukraine.

Some highlights include the walls built as fortifications of a Jesuit monastery that still stand proud, and now also house the Museum of Local History for history buffs to learn all about the period features on show here. They even have a mammoth skeleton that is said to be over 30,000 years old! "

Be sure to check out La Feria Tristán Narvaja flea market, The Rambla, and Plaza de Independecia. "
Itaipu Dam,"Salto is the country’s second biggest city and is named after the point where the Rio Uruguay makes a “big jump.”  People make their way here for the hot springs and the outdoor activities offered.  You’ll find a pretty riverfront town that’s relaxed and lets you easily unwind. Oddly enough, the town’s hydroelectric dam, located 2ok from the city, is a very popular tourist site.   Check out the hot springs at Daymán which has three pools of varying temperatures, different showers and fountains, and great area to enjoy a picnic lunch. "
Paysandú,"The third-largest city is Paysandú and it’s joined to Colón, Argentina by the Puente Internacional General Artigas. Founded as an outpost for cattle herders in the regions, the town has grown to be the source of most of the meat for all of Uruguay.  These days, the action is on Plaza Constitución so plan to spend an afternoon strolling around.  If you time it right, you can join in the city’s annual week long beer festival and see a wilder side of laid-back Paysandú.

Fishing, yachting and exploring the Paraná Delta are the major pastimes here.  Situated near the convergence of the Rio Uruguay and the Rio de la Plata, there’s a lovely sheltered harbour here.  Cross the bridge to Playa Sere beach with great space for camping in the adjoining park.  Bring some extra cash on hand to enjoy the casino. "
Chuy,"Chuy sits on the Atlantic coast in Uruguay and right across the street is its twin sister Chui, in Brazil.  The main street between these two towns is the actual border between Brazil and Uruguay. Half the town will call out, “Bienvenido,” as you pass, and the other half will say, “Bem vinda.”  Don’t miss Fuerte San Miguel, an 18th century fort integral in the formation of Uruguay as an independent country, and Fortaleza de Santa Teresa, a National Historic Monument located in a national park. "
Colonia,"Founded in the 17th century, Colonia is now designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’ll love the old colonial buildings and cobblestone streets that provide so much character.  The city itself was, for a long time, a smuggling port and changed hands several times between the Portuguese and the Spanish. As you’d imagine, the main attraction is the old historic centre.  There are eight small museums here (all for the price of one ticket). The town lighthouse provides a lovely view of the city and the river. Visit the abandoned Basilica del Sanctísimo Sacramento, an old bullfighting ring and enjoy some of Colonia’s asado, a favourite among the locals. "

Punta del Diablo,"This old timey fishing village is now the number one summer getaway destination for Argentines and Uruguayans.  It’s also the heart of the backpacker scene in Uruguay.  There’s been a lot of development recently, but the town hasn’t lost its charm. Another fantastic town with a gorgeous coastline and laid-back atmosphere, you’ll love this little corner of the country.  Be sure to check out the sandy plaza, located about 200m inland.  Small sandy streets fan out in all directions. "
Punta del Este,"This beach resort town has everything:  sand, yachts, casinos, and sun. Sometimes called the Monaco of South America, Punta del Este is a bit expensive compared to the rest of Uruguay, but the amazing coast, activities, restaurants and more make it a must see town.

Some popular sites for heritage and cultural tourists to visit in this now-thriving modern city are the Discovery of Gold Monument, the Bendigo Tramways Museum, the Golden Dragon museum (which commemorates the Chinese population which developed during the gold rush, peaking at 20% of the town’s population in the 1860s) and the Joss House Temple, as well as several buildings that are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register: the Bendigo Town Hall (built in 1859), the Old Post Office, the Law Courts (1892), the Sacred Heart Cathedral (1896), Shamrock Hotel (1897), and the Memorial Military Museum (1921). The growing city has much to offer beyond heritage and cultural tourism: lovely national parks, a science museum, the excellent Bendigo Art Gallery, and the Bendigo Botanic Gardens which overlook the gorgeous Lake Weeroona. "
Wilsons Promontory National Park,"Victoria’s largest coastal wilderness area is beloved by locals and tourists alike, with the opportunity to get close to a wide variety of Australian native flora and fauna; “the Prom”, as it is nicknamed, is the home to many kangaroos, emus, wombats, echidnas, and gorgeous birdlife. As the Prom is well-touristed, these animals are very used to people, and will be very friendly to you if you’ve got some feed to offer! The walking trails at the Prom are lovely, and it’s also a great spot for relaxing on the beach. It’s a popular location for camping, but also for romantic getaways, so you’re sure to find accommodation that suits your needs as well. <strong>Available tour</strong>: <a href=""https://www.getyourguide.com/victoria-australia-l167/wilsons-promontory-25-hour-wilderness-cruise-t313758/?partner_id=AS1RATG"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Wilsons Promontory: 2.5-Hour Wilderness Cruise</a> "
Mornington Peninsula,"The Mornington Peninsula is a lovely little day-trip from the hustle and bustle of Melbourne; just over an hour away (and a very pleasant drive), you’ll find a different world. The peninsula is famous for its wineries, cherries and berries, as well as produce straight from the farm-gate (and tasty restaurant fare, as well!). It’s also a popular foraging spot, including for sea spray herb, seaweed and mushrooms (Mushroom Tours offers helpful advice on distinguishing from the poisonous and the palatable!) Like many regional attractions, the gorgeous walking trails on the peninsula shouldn’t be missed, but there’s also plenty to do in the towns. The Peninsular Hot Spring in Sorrento are particularly enjoyable, especially as natural hot springs in Australia are few and far between. Rosebud and Rye boast many family attractions, and if you’re in the mood for a beachside tipple, Portsea has a lovely pub. The bright, colorful shacks along the beach at Mount Martha make it well worth a visit too. There are several national parks on the peninsula, spanning over 25,000 hectares in total. They include lovely sites such as Cape Schank (home of a lighthouse build in 1859 which still operates today, as well as being a perfect spot to catch the sunset). <strong>Book online</strong>: <a href=""https://www.getyourguide.com/mornington-peninsula-l1878/mornington-peninsula-hot-springs-tour-t237157/?partner_id=AS1RATG"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Mornington Peninsula &amp; Hot Springs Tour</a> "
Healesville Sanctuary,"Located in the heart of the scenic Yarra Valley, this sanctuary is widely considered to be the best spot in Australia to see and interact with Australian wildlife in unspoiled natural habitat. Get up close and personal with all manner of famous Aussie animals: kangaroos, koalas, emus, wombats and even platypuses (the sanctuary’s most iconic species). There’s also several interesting “wild encounters” available, such as “wombat pat &amp; play”, “wade with the platypus” and a dingo encounter (apparently they sometimes give visitors a kiss on the cheek!) These uniquely Australian experiences make the sanctuary a trip to remember. <strong>Book online</strong>: <a href=""https://www.getyourguide.com/healesville-l7926/healesville-sanctuary-general-admission-ticket-t66109/?partner_id=AS1RATG"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Healesville Sanctuary General Admission Ticket</a> "
St Kilda,"Melbourne has a lot to offer visitors, but a particular must-see is St Kilda. This suburb boasts a wide range of attractions, from beachside relaxation to a thriving nightlife scene, the famous Esplanade Markets, and some of the best food in the city (if not the state). The suburb is quite ethnically diverse, and Acland Street in particular is well-known for its Greek and Jewish bakeries and cake shops, so it’s a perfect spot if you’ve got a sweet tooth. There’s also many vegetarian restaurants here (particularly noteworthy is the pay-as-you-feel Lentil as Anything). St Kilda is also known for its boutique shopping, vintage finds, and its iconic colorful beach shacks. The pier is gorgeous, especially when it’s lit up at night and you can go penguin-spotting. The botanic gardens are also a lovely way to work up an appetite for the excellent local fare (or alternatively, work off that delicious cake!) "
Fitzroy,"Fitzroy is described by Time Out as an “inner-city mecca for all things cool and kooky”; vintage shopping, a vibrant bar and pub scene, a thriving alternative subculture, and delicious restaurants serving a wide range of Australian and international food, generally at very reasonable prices. The best thing about Fitzroy is definitely the atmosphere &#8211; it’s a fun area just for a wander around – but there’s also lots of live music events going on at any time, as well as a variety of markets, art events, etc. A visit to the in.cube8r Fitzroy Emporium and Gallery is also highly recommended. "
Carlton Gardens,"The Carlton Gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a short walk from Melbourne’s city centre. The complex includes the Royal Exhibition Building, Imax Cinema, and Melbourne Museum, all of which are well worth a visit. The gardens are a gorgeous example of Victorian landscaping, as well as being noteworthy for their biodiversity. The Royal Exhibition Building is a very attractive example of heritage architecture. You’ll also find plenty of wildlife in the area, such as possums, kookaburras, and tawny frogmouths; there’s even bats at night! There are three major fountains in the complex as well: the Exhibition, French and Westgarth Drinking fountains. "
Daylesford,"Daylesford is a gorgeous spa town roughly an hour and a half from Melbourne, making it very popular with both locals and tourists. Originally established as a gold-mining town, Daylesford has been a popular spa destination for a century. The town is famous for its natural spring mineral spas; the broader area of the town and surrounds are home to over 80% of Australia’s effervescent mineral water. As well as its many spas, Daylesford is known for its wineries, galleries, restaurants, and its gorgeous lake views. The Wombat Hill Botanical Gardens are also a lovely attraction, and the stunning Hepburn Regional Park is only a stone’s throw away. "
Puffing Billy,"The Dandenong Ranges are a low mountain range on the outskirts of Melbourne, 35km from the city centre. Gorgeous, lush and green, they make for a popular nature day-trip for the locals, as well as a must-see for tourists. In particular, the popular Puffing Billy scenic railroad is a great way to enjoy the beauty of the Ranges. The highest point is Mount Dandenong, at 633 metres. You’ll find great farm-gate produce here, breathtaking bushwalks, lovely bed-and-breakfasts, sweet little towns, immaculate gardens, and well-preserved Australian architecture. "
Ballarat,"Ballarat is another famed gold-rush boom town, now a thriving city with great cafes and restaurants, and many events to attract the modern traveler as well (the Ballarat Beer Festival and the Summer of Sound are particularly popular). The Ballarat Art Gallery is also a must-see, a stroll around the lake is a fun way to while away some time, and the Ballarat Wildlife Park is a great spot for a koala fix! Like Bendigo, it has done a fantastic job of preserving its history: there are plenty of examples of heritage architecture to be found, and the fascinating Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka is actually located on the historic site of the 1854 Eureka Stockade, the site of a renowned rebellion against the colonial authority of the UK that was a crucial moment in the history of Australia’s road to becoming an independent democracy. Sovereign Hill is a particularly enjoyable tourist site in Ballarat; this open-air museum and historical park has been described as Australia’s best outdoor museum, and it will truly make you feel like you’ve traveled back in time to the heady days of the beginning of the gold rush over 150 years ago! The experience is very authentic, and highly informative; you can go underground and enjoy a fully-guided gold mine tour, visit 1850s shops, see steam-driven machinery in operation, and have a chat with the various fully-costumed staff members “plying their trades” as candlemakers, wheelwrights and candy-makers of yore. (Of course, it’s also a fantastic spot for photo opportunities!) 8km outside of Ballarat, you’ll find Kryal Castle, biling itself as “Australia’s only medieval adventure park and resort”. There’s something a little out-of-place about jousting knights and dragons in the middle of Australia at the height of summer, but it’s still a lot of fun, and fantastic to keep any smaller travelers in your group entertained.

Stratford-upon-Avon,"Even four hundred years after his death, William Shakespeare is still the dominant personality in Stratford. Many houses look almost exactly as they would have done when he was growing up in this town. You can pay homage at Shakespeare&#8217;s birthplace and drop by the home of his wife, Anne Hathaway, both weathered timber-framed buildings. And if that isn&#8217;t enough you can even see Mary Arden&#8217;s farm, the home of Shakespeare&#8217;s mother, and Hall&#8217;s Croft, where his daughter Susanna lived. The presence of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre makes Stratford one of England&#8217;s cultural Meccas, a destination to watch first-rate productions of Shakespeare&#8217;s many works. "
Warwick Castle,"Like Stratford, the county town is one of those places in England you simply have to see. This has much to do with Warwick Castle, which is so complete it&#8217;s almost overwhelming. This fortress -turned-stately home is the last word in 14th-century military architecture, and its romantic tales and legends are expertly retold inside. The town is also a joy, suffused with history and all the better to explore because of its browsable independent shops. After the castle see half-timbered Lord Leycester Hospital, the Collegiate Church of St Mary where the Earls of Warwick are buried, and the amazing Mill Garden, which looks like a scene from a pre-Raphaelite painting. "
Leamington Spa,"The springs at Leamington Spa were harnessed by the Romans but then lay hidden to all until they were rediscovered in 1784. And in the years that followed Leamington Spa exploded out of almost nothing, becoming one of England&#8217;s most prestigious hydrotherapy resorts. The sudden growth endowed the town with some of the most graceful Regency architecture you could hope to see. The Parade is the main artery, while Lansdowne Crescent is a circus of stuccoed townhouses with wrought iron porches. The Royal Pump Rooms have preserved restored the baths, and will give you insights about the spa in its heyday. "
"Rugby, Warwickshire","There can&#8217;t be many towns able to brag about giving birth to a sport, but Rugby is one. When William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a football match at Rugby School in 1823, he created a style of play that would become Rugby. Or so the story goes! If you&#8217;re a fan of the sport you&#8217;ll have a few experiences to tick off, like a visit to the museum at the prestigious Rugby School, and the Webb Ellis Rugby Football Museum, which is housed in the shop where the boot maker James Gilbert stitched the first rugby balls in 1842. "
Kenilworth Castle,"This presentable town is home to Kenilworth Castle, which has 900 years of riveting history to tell. The ruins are colossal, and bring home just how ambitious the castle-cum-palace would have been in medieval and Tudor times. And it may make you giddy to consider the amount of historical events that have happened at this very building, like Edward II&#8217;s removal from the throne, or Robert Dudley&#8217;s courtship of Elizabeth I in 1575. For another piece of aristocratic grandeur Stoneleigh Abbey is a former monastery that became a neoclassical stately home and is wrapped in almost 300 hectares of panoramic grounds. "
Henley-in-Arden,"This small town in the west of the county doesn&#8217;t resemble many places in England: The high street, which spans almost the entirety of the town is a strip a mile in length and flanked by a continuous succession of historic buildings from a range of eras. The Heritage Centre can explain the background on this singular place, while the timber-framed Guildhall dates to the 1400s and recently underwent a restoration. You can poke around the two medieval churches or wander off along the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. At Lowsonford there&#8217;s a sculpture by the water designed by Sir Anthony Gormley, the same man responsible for the iconic Angel of the North in Tyne and Wear. "
"Coughton Court, Alcester","Founded as Alaunia in the 1st Century by the Romans, Alcester is on the Roman Road, Icknield Way that runs diagonally from Gloucestershire up to South Yorkshire. Bring the little guys to the Alcester Roman Heritage Centre to find out a bit more about these ancient origins and dress up as legionaries. The showpiece in the Alcester area is undoubtedly Coughton Court, a wondrous Tudor country house. In 1605 several conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot rode to Coughton Couty to seek refuge after their plans were discovered. The failed Throckmorton Plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I was also hatched right here in 1583. "
Coleshill,"An understated market town, Coleshill is without blockbuster attractions but does possess a very pretty high street. There are a few Tudor-era timber houses along here, as well as old coaching inns that are still in use as hotels or pubs. Allow some time to explore the Church of St Peter and St Paul, which is magnificent for a parish church. The spire climbs to 51 metres and inside are compelling fittings like a Norman font from the 1100s and recumbent medieval tomb effigies of knights. There&#8217;s no lack of inspiration for local days out, as Drayton Manor theme park is a minutes away, while Hoar Park is a neat shopping development set in converted barns from the 1600s. "
Nuneaton,"The county&#8217;s largest settlement is a workaday town with a large shopping precinct in the centre. Those of a literary bent will be happy to learn that Nuneaton was the birthplace of the Victorian writer George Eliot, and she drew a lot of inspiration from Nuneaton and local towns and estates. On set weekends of the year, Arbury Hall, her birthplace, welcomes visitors to conduct them around the house and grounds, but if you&#8217;re not around at these times there&#8217;s always the Nuneaton Museum &amp; Art Gallery. You have a whole gallery here devoted to Eliot&#8217;s relationship with Nuneaton. "
"Packwood House, Lapworth, Warwickshire","This village a brief drive north of Warwick is a dispersed community of large houses home to some relatively famous people. But the most exciting properties here are the historic ones, and these are open to visitors as National Trust attractions. Baddlesey Clinton is a breathtaking manor house protected by a moat that you have to cross on an old bridge. What&#8217;s fascinating about this one is that it sheltered Catholic priests who were being persecuted after the Reformation. Check out the priest holes, secret passages that led underground in case the house was searched. Packwood House is just as fine and goes back to the 1500s. The richly furnished interiors at this property have fine tapestries, while the Yew Garden in the grounds was plotted in the 1600s and has a hidden religious theme. "
Granite Mountain,"Granite Mountain offers outstanding views from its peak that include Crystal Lake, Kaleetan Peak and Mount Rainer. Climbing to the top of Granite Mountain is a steep climb, for every mile you go you gain nearly 1,000 feet in elevation. The best time to enjoy the staggering sights is during the week as sometimes weekends can get a little busy at the summit. "
"Diablo Lake, Washington","In the North Cascade mountains is a reservoir created by Diablo Dam, it is called Diablo Lake. There is a good selection of fish kept in the lake and you can expect to see many canoeists and kayakers out on the water. The water in the lake has a turquoise hue that is caused by the surrounding glaciers that send a fine powder into the lakes. "
Ferry From Seattle To Bremerton,If you get a chance to take the ferry from Seattle to Bremerton it is highly recommended that you take it. The ferry has been running this route since 1951 and it takes about one hour to complete the journey. The scenery is mesmerising especially when you look up and see Mount Rainer. 
Lake Kachess &#8211; Washington,Jade Lake is roughly an 11 mile trek from the start of the trail but it is a hike that is well worth taking. The lake is a beautiful sight and one that any keen hiker should have on his or her bucket list. The lake gets its unique colour from the surrounding glacial silt. 
Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument,"The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is a 110,000 acre volcano that has been set aside for visitors to enjoy, research to be carried out and also for educational purposes. The volcano last erupted in 1980 and visitors have been able to climb to the summer of the volcano since 1986. "
"Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge, Washington State","Nisqually Vista is an easy hiking trail that goes around in a loop. The loop is just over 2 miles in length and is suitable for all levels of fitness. There are plenty of beautiful wildflowers along the trail which is one of the reasons the area is famous. The ideal time to explore this area would be July through August, this will enable you to see the maximum number of flowers in bloom. "
"Sol Duc Falls At Olympic National Park, Washington State",There is much to see and experience at Olympic National Park as the park covers several ecosystems. The star of the show is the Olympic Mountains with Mount Olympus having a glacier clad summit which is popular with climbers. 
Palouse Region Of Washington State,"The Palouse region is a beautiful area full of rolling hills that have a rich farmland history. The hills are asymmetrical and offer some of the most beautiful, peaceful, lush green landscape available. "
Perfection Lake,Perfection Lake is part of the Enchantments in Washington State. The lake itself is shallow and clear at one end and as you walk down the trail you will pass through meadows and continue along the eastern shore. The lake is a stunning reminder of how nature naturally creates the most beautiful of sites by itself. 
Riverfront Park In Spokane,"Riverfront Park is a park that is over 100 acres in size, it contains the Spokane Falls but the main feature of the park is the 145 foot tall pavilion that was created during Expo ’74. There are many things to do in the park and a walk along the Spokane River Centennial Trail will see you take in many beautiful sights. "
Mount Shuksan,Mount Shuksan lies 11.6 miles south of the Canadian Border. A glaciated complex peak that has four major faces and five ridges to climb. Mount Shuksan is one of the most photographed mountains in the world due to its sheer beauty. 
"Cape Flattery, Washington",A trip to Cape Flattery will see you reaching the north-western most point of the contiguous United States. To get to Cape Flattery you will need to take a short hike along a board walked path.  This also happens to be the oldest named feature in Washington after James Cook named it in 1778. 
"Hoh Rainforest Trail, Olympic National Park, Washington",The most outstanding feature of the Hoh Rainforest are the Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees. Some of these trees grow to a staggering 95 meters in height and 7 meters in diameter. As you walk through the rainforest you will come across many unique mosses and lichens which add to the fairy tale feeling this rain forest brings. 
"Enchanted Valley, Olympic National Park",The Enchanted Valley trail is a 36 mile trail and that is popular with hikers and horse riders. The Enchanted Valley itself is exactly what you would expect from its name. It is magical and enchanted and a wide open section of the Quinault River. 
Birmingham,"Affectionately known as &#8220;Brum&#8221;, the city of Birmingham has never been known for its looks, but because of the regeneration of its centre and its huge canal system people are now see Britain&#8217;s second city in a different way. Even before this facelift Birmingham was already much-loved for its nightlife, dining (especially Indian food in the&#8221; Balti triangle&#8221;) and shopping. You could say that the city was the workshop of the Industrial Revolution, and if you&#8217;re curious about this period try Soho House, the 18th-century home of the entrepreneur Matthew Boulton. This is one of many absorbing museums dealing either with the wealth that industry created, or (at the Back to Backs) what it was like for workers. "
Coventry,"As with Birmingham, Coventry&#8217;s factories made the city a target for bombing in the Second World War. Famously, this destroyed the gothic Coventry Cathedral, and the hollow walls, spire and tower have been kept as they were to stand as a memorial. Coventry also has a historic association with vehicle manufacturing, especially for domestic brands like Jaguar and Rover. You can get the lowdown on the history of car building at the Coventry Transport Museum, which has the largest collection of British road vehicles in the world. Aircraft have also been assembled in Coventry since the early days of manned flight: Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine, was Coventry-born. The Midland Air Museum will tell you all you need to know. "
Sutton Coldfield,"A few miles west of Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield has always been a town with money. The landed gentry and wealthy families who called Sutton Coldfield &#8220;home&#8221; built plush manors, many of which of are now hotels which will make you feel like a lord for a night or two. There are two conservation areas in the town, looking after the cottages and townhouses from the 1600s and 1700s. Sutton Coldfield is almost completely surrounded by parkland and nature reserves. In the New Hall Valley Country Park is the New Hall Mill, one of only two functioning watermills around Birmingham. Sutton Park meanwhile is one of Europe&#8217;s biggest urban parks, with  more than nine square kilometres of woods and heathland, grazed by wild ponies. "
Wolverhampton,"During the Industrial Revolution Wolverhampton was known for its coal-mining, steel production and manufacturing, and engineering is still a cornerstone of the local economy. Not many people would think of the city as a tourist destination, but almost everyone who comes is taken aback by what Wolverhampton has to offer. This goes for its clutch of stately homes owned by the National Trust, like Moseley Old Hall and Boscobel House, both witness to riveting episodes in the English Civil War in the 17th century. You could find out how the other half lived in Wolverhampton&#8217;s industrial days at Bantock House, or be impressed by the Pop Art and pre-Raphaelites at Wolverhampton Art Gallery. "
Solihull,"In a large conurbation like the West Midlands, it&#8217;s not always easy to find a town that is genuinely in the countryside. Well, Solihull is one such town, and rates highly on England&#8217;s liveability scale. The town is in a green belt, which demands that development is restricted, giving rise to massive green spaces like the Malvern and Brueton Park, which resembles open country but retains some civility with the help of its tea rooms. Jaguars and Land Rovers are manufactured on the edge of Solihull and you can go behind the scenes at these state-of-the-art facilities. "
Dudley Castle,"The town of Dudley is often called the capital of the Black Country, which was effectively ground zero for the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. The limestone quarries, kilns and ironworks turned Dudley into an industrial behemoth that made the chain and anchor for the Titanic. You can dig a bit deeper at the Black Country Living Museum, where workers&#8217; cottages, shops, cobblestone, lime kilns and iron mongers are all frozen in time. Also worth your time is the Dudley Tunnel , the second-longest canal tunnel in England, at almost four kilometres. History of a far older kind is also represented at the 13th-century Dudley Castle (the grounds of which hold Dudley Zoo) and the haunting ruins of 12th-century Dudley Priory. "
Edgbaston Reservoir,"The upmarket southern suburb of Birmingham was where the novelist Tolkien lived as a teenager. It&#8217;s mostly tree-lined lanes with Victorian mansions and large houses separated from the road by long drives. Edgbaston is posh and residential, but there&#8217;s no shortage of reasons to pay a visit. In spring and summer that quintessentially English sport, cricket is offered at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground, the home of Warwickshire County Cricket Club but also where England plays one-day and five-day matches. In the art deco Grade II listed Barber Institute of Fine Arts you have a serious assortment of paintings by Rembrandt, Veronese, Rubens, van Dyck, Monet, van Gogh and Picasso. Not to mention a huge coin collection that runs to many thousand pieces, mostly Roman and Byzantine. "
Walsall,"This town was a hub of iron and leather manufacturing, activities so embedded in its culture that the local football team Walsall F.C. is nicknamed &#8220;the Saddlers&#8221;. Indeed, Walsall was the international centre of saddle-making, as you can discover at the Leather Museum, which is set in an original Victorian factory. In recent years a lot of money has been spent on regenerating the centre, especially on the canal-front. This has helped furnish Walsall with the New Art Gallery, replete with a surprisingly rich collection of art by Constable, Turner, van Gogh, Monet and more. "
Halesowen,"The site of a good many coal pits and mines, Halesowen was where nails were manufactured as industry took hold. But there&#8217;s a more romantic side to the town as you&#8217;ll uncover at the Grade I-listed Leasowes Park. In these 57 hectares is one of the England&#8217;s earliest landscape gardens, designed in the mid-1700s by the poet William Shenstone. English gardens as we know them don&#8217;t get much older than this, and among its early visitors were John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the second and third presidents of the United States. Halesowen also has a crumbling old abbey, left to deteriorate after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1530 and conserved today by English Heritage. "
West Bromwich,"Although manufacturing has declined all over Britain, chemicals and engineering remain a big employer in West Bromwich, as they were in the 1700s. A few miles from the centre of Birmingham, it&#8217;s a restrained sort of town but has done well to conserve its fragments of history. There are two beautiful wattle and daub buildings, the West Bromwich Manor House, which has its roots in the 1200s, and the Oak House Museum, a restored yeoman&#8217;s house built around the late-1500s. The local team West Bromwich Albion is a Premier League mainstay, and was one of the Football League&#8217;s founder members in 1888. "
Berkswell,"Not far from Coventry, Berskwell is an exceedingly pretty village of cottages from the 1600 and 1700s. Berkswell and its local hamlets are dotted with small but satisfying things to track down and enjoy. See the Norman Church of St. John the Baptist where there&#8217;s a crypt in two sections between the chancel and then the nave. In the churchyard is the medieval well that puts the &#8220;well&#8221; in Berkswell, and on the village green are the actual stocks used to punish petty criminals. Berkswell Windmill dates to the 1830s and its original mechanism still works, and lastly the 17th-century Ram Hall is now a dairy making ewe&#8217;s milk cheese. "
Stourbridge,"From the 1600s up until the 20th century the local trade in Stourbridge had been glassmaking, which took off after French Huguenots came to work in the coal mines. The Red House Cone is one of just a few of the old glassmaking kilns remaining, and was in use up to the 1930s. There are traditional glass-blowing demonstrations at the Red House Cone, and you can go to the Ruskin Glass Centre and the Broadfield House Glass Museum for exhibitions of Stourbridge Glass. The National Trust has one of weirdest properties in its inventory in Stourbridge, Kinver Edge and the Rock Houses is a group of old dwellings cut from a sandstone ridge below the remnants of an Iron Age hill fort. "
Hagley &#8211; Brake Mill,"On the boundary with Worcestershire, Hagley is in essence a commuter village for people working in Birmingham, but has a few attractions and things to see in the area. One is the Grade I-listed Hagley Hall, which has been in the Lyttleton family since it the estate was founded in the early-1700s. It was built in the neo-palladian style and you can book a tour to see the opulently decorated interiors and 350-acre grounds. This might be a drag for kids, but they&#8217;ll be wild about the Falconry Centre, which has hawks, owls and eagles native to the UK and brings them out of their spacious aviaries to show them off up close. "
Allesley,"Driving into the old village of Allesley on the Birmingham Road is a joy. There are old iron gas lanterns, Georgian brick houses and even older half-timbered houses. It&#8217;s only a small settlement, with a population of a few hundred, but you could idle here for an hour or two. There has been a pub on the site of the Rainbow Inn since 1680 and the Grade I-listed All Saints Church in Allesley has a history that can be traced back to Norman times. You can play a round at the 18-hole golf course at Allesley Park or hire an iron and putter for some pitch and putt. "
"Meriden, England","Between Birmingham and Coventry, Meriden is a pleasant little village in a conservation area, and a good place to park up for a look around. There are a few timber-framed houses going back to the 1500s with examples of medieval moated farmsteads and historic manor houses. There was a Triumph motorcycle factory in the village, which was here until 1983, and to continue the two-wheeled theme there&#8217;s an unusual memorial on the village green for all of the cyclists killed in the First World War. Meriden has all of the essential village amenities, like a traditional pub and tea house, as well as the dinky Church of St. Laurence, with a nave and chancel as old as the 1100s. "
Chichester,"As the &#8220;ester&#8221; suffix in the name implies, Chichester has a Roman history. But it could also be Britain&#8217;s earliest Roman history as Chichester may have been where Claudius&#8217; army landed in AD 43. As you see it now, Chichester is a sophisticated Georgian city straight out of a Jane Austen novel. In one of its many townhouses is the Pallant House Gallery, with a cache of 20th-century British art by Lucien Freud, David Bomberg, Peter Blake and many more. Chichester Cathedral, from 1075, has the honour being the only English cathedral visible from the sea, and the walled Bishop&#8217;s Palace Gardens is a secret oasis of bright colour in spring and summer. "
Arundel Castle,"In the splendour of the South Downs, Arundel is an adorable town commanded by one of England&#8217;s most complete medieval castles. Arundel was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086, and the castle had been founded in 1067 within months of the Norman Conquest of England. It was damaged in the Civil War in the 1600s, but was restored in the 1700s and is now one of Sussex&#8217;s most-visited attractions, with an armoury, chapel, dry moat and vistas of the River Arun and countryside from its fairytale towers. The cathedral in Arundel may look for all the world like it is medieval but actually dates to the 1800s, has a French Gothic style and was designed by Joseph Hansom famed for his Hansom horse-drawn cabs. "
Petworth House,"With a heady mix of art, charming old streets and history, Petworth is a wonderful town in the South Downs. You have to start with Petworth House, whose 19th-century owner George Wyndham was a close friend of J.M.W. Turner, who came to paint the deer park in the 1820s. The stately home, owned by the National Trust, has lots of Turner paintings, and scenes from the acclaimed film, Mr Turner were shot here. The centre of Petworth is a pleasure, especially on Lombard Street, a narrow cobbled alley snaking up to the yard of St Mary&#8217;s Church. Being a well-to-do little town there are lots of antiques shops, artisan boutiques and galleries to browse. "
South Downs National Park,"A broad band across the middle of the county became a National Park in 2011. A great deal of this landscape is grassy, rounded chalk downs that reach substantial heights but also make for easy-going walks for their smooth slopes. Every few miles in any direction there will be a thatched village with a bed &amp; breakfast and pub, and if you&#8217;re up for an adventure the South Downs Way is a 100-mile footpath from Hampshire to East Sussex. In West Sussex there&#8217;s a lot to see in rural areas. Just north of Worthing is Cissbury Ring, where Neolithic cultures mined for flint. The tallest hill, Blackdown, peaks at 280 metres and is where the Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson retired in the late-19th century. "
Worthing Pier,"West Sussex&#8217;s largest town has had the sobriquet &#8220;Sunny Worthing &#8221; since the 19th century when well-off Victorians started arriving for their holidays. The golden age of the British seaside has long gone, but Worthing gives the sense of a working town in good condition, that can turn into a bucket and spade resort as soon as the sun comes out. The pier dates to 1862 and is a listed building, with a newly refurbished tearoom. Worthing has all the amenities of a city, but you&#8217;re right by the lower slopes of the South Downs too. And in the Sompting area just west of Worthing there&#8217;s a St Mary&#8217;s Church, a very historic Anglo-Saxon building completed well before William the Conqueror arrived and in great condition for its age. "
Shoreham-by-Sea,"Most people know Shoreham for its airport, which is better than it sounds: There are no airline flights and the airport is mostly for public aerobatic demonstrations and private pilots. There&#8217;s a visitor centre at the terminal, which is a stylish art deco building completed in 1936. The beach at Shoreham is on massive a sandbank, which has been developed into an upmarket residential neighbourhood. The long shingle beach is lovely for walks at any time of year, and the seascape here was painted by John Constable in 1828. Shoreham Fort is a peculiar reminder of a forgotten episode in history. It was built in the 1850s when there was real concern about a French invasion during the rule of Napoleon III. The ditches, cannon wall, gun platform and the caponiers have all been restored recently. "
Horsham,"In the Weald, a hilly ridge that sweeps across the centre and north of the county, Horsham is a prosperous and smart market town embedded in beautiful countryside. You hardly have to leave the town before you&#8217;re ambling in peaceful green spaces at the ecologically-diverse Warnham Local Nature Reserve or Sumners Ponds, 40 hectares of secluded lakes. As one of the larger towns in the area, Horsham is a shopping destination and its centre is full of period charm, with elegant houses from the Victorian and Georgian times. One Georgian resident was Percy Bysshe Shelley, the Romantic poet born here in 1792 and future husband of Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. The Horsham Museum will tell you all about this connection and much more. "
Amberley Museum,"There&#8217;s unblemished nature on all sides of this gorgeous village in the South Downs National Park. Amberley, on the east bank of the Arun, is noted for its thatched cottages, many with walls decorated with flint and flowery gardens out front. There are tea rooms by the river and inns serving traditional pub food. But if you&#8217;re in the mood for a lordly feast you could head for Amberley Castle, which is a fortified manor house from the 1300s and now a hotel and restaurant. As for countryside, the Amberley Wild Brooks is on the Arun&#8217;s floodplain and sustains a variety of wildfowl in winter, while the Amberley Museum is dedicated to the old trades in the area like printing and pottery, and has a 1950s Fire Station and a working narrow gauge steam railway. "
"Cowdray House, Midhurst","In the Sussex Weald, Midhurst is a country town that has some riveting stories to tell. The town has plotted its own heritage trail taking you to a former Iron Age fort and pointing out the most significant medieval, Georgian and Victorian houses around the town. There are more than 100 listed buildings in all, and none are as mysterious and impressive as Cowdray House. This was one of England&#8217;s most prestigious Tudor Mansions: Henry VIII and Elizabeth I stayed here, and Guy Fawkes worked here in the late-1500s. The house was destroyed by fire in 1793, but most of house&#8217;s towers and walls survive to create a spectral ruin. "
Littlehampton,"At the mouth of the Arun, Littlehampton is a seaside town with more of an earthy feel to resorts like Worthing and Bognor. The most traditional part is the historic harbour along the east bank of the river estuary, where old waterside houses for fishermen are now cafes and fish and chip shops. There&#8217;s a new promenade by the water and you can walk all the way down to Harbour Park by the seafront, which buzzes with visitors on warmer days and has lots for kids to get up to. You catch a ferry to the east bank of the Arun and look back at all the old waterside buildings, or stroll along the beach where there are time-honoured amusements like pitch &amp; putt, crazy golf and a little railway. "
Fishbourne Roman Palace,"Only one stop on the train west of Chichester, Fishbourne has a couple of big attractions to make the journey necessary. The marquee attraction is the Fishbourne Roman Palace, which is an archaeological museum preserving the ground floor of a palace and supply fort established in AD 43, year one of the Roman invasion. What&#8217;s intriguing is the way the palace was updated, with plain black and white mosaics overlaid in later years by glorious examples  of craftsmanship like the perfectly preserved Cupid on a Dolphin Mosaic. Fishbourne also borders the Chichester Harbour Area of Natural Beauty, one of England&#8217;s only undeveloped natural harbours: A paradise for boaters and a haven for coastal wildlife. "
Bosham,"Moments from the Hampshire boundary, Bosham is an impossibly cute village nestling beside an inlet on Chichester Harbour. In the middle ages this was one of the most prestigious towns in Sussex, and was even mentioned in the Bayeaux Tapestry. King Canute had a palace here in the early-11th century, and his young daughter is buried at the Holy Trinity Church. This exciting building has a mixture of Saxon and Norman architecture and is one of the essential sights in the village. The waterfront and Bosham Quay are adorable with a rustic maritime feel and unbroken views out over Chichester Harbour. "
Bognor Regis,"The resort of Bognor Regis is synonymous with the British beach holiday, the kind that almost  everybody in the country used to take until cheap flights abroad arrived in the 1970s. One explanation for Bognor&#8217;s rapid rise was a quirk of the climate, as this location gets more hours of sunshine a year than anywhere else in the UK. And in July and August its charms are most obvious, when you can unfold a deck chair and sunbathe on the expansive pebble beaches, go for lunch at a seafront restaurant and amble around the town&#8217;s flower gardens at Hotham and Marine Park. The pier is the venue for the International Birdman competition in early September, when human &#8220;birdmen&#8221; attempt to fly off the end of it. You can guess how this pans out! "
Bramber Castle,"For an English village, Bramber is a very visitor-oriented place, with several restaurants along its picturesque main street &#8220;the St&#8221;. The setting is as charming as any in the South Downs, with flint walls and cottages clad with ivy and wisteria. For sight-seeing you can work your way up to the ruins of Bramber Castle. Like many English fortifications, this landmark took some punishment in the English Civil war, but sections of its walls are still here and you can make out the earthworks of the original Norman motte and bailey castle. Best of all is St Mary&#8217;s House, also on the St. Many call this Tudor wonder the best timber house in West Sussex, and the interior has painted panelled rooms in the Elizabethan trompe l&#8217;oeil style. "
The National Trust Garden at Nymans,"One of the largest towns in the county, Haywards Heath is a thriving and prosperous place, perfect for a meal or shopping trip. But for tourists the best thing about it is the proximity to some of West Sussex&#8217;s most revered National Trust properties. Nymans and Wakehurst Place are the showstoppers in the area. The former is a divine English country garden in the Arts and Crafts style of the early-20th century around the ruins of a &#8220;Jacobethan&#8221; manor house that was gutted by fire in the 30s and now stands as a solemn ruin. Wakehurst Place meanwhile is managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, and has landscaped wetland, woodland, ponds and walled gardens across two square kilometres. "
Hinton &#8211; West Virginia,"Hinton was once a railroad town, where train led its complete economy and development. Today, Hinton retains its interesting railroad history by preserving its unique architecture and offering regular cultural tours. You can even take a ride on the old timer train during Railroad Days and visit the Hinton Railroad Museum for even more historical fun. Hinton is also a great place for outdoor recreation. The New River Gorge National Park and the Bluestone National Park are close by where you can camp, fish, whitewater raft, hike, and cycle all throughout the region. In the winter, the town is nearby the Winterplace Ski Resort, one of the best ski resorts in the area. "

Interestingly, despite its small size, the town has nearly 100 venues where you can buy and admire local artwork. There are also a variety of other quirky shops, spas, and all types of accommodation choices. Many passing through use Berkeley Springs as a base for the Cacapon Resort State Park, an area that has a golf course, trails for exploring, and even a sandy beach to sprawl out on. You can also use it as a peaceful and less hectic base to see Washington DC or Baltimore, as it’s only an hour and a half away. "
White Sulphur Springs &#8211; West Virginia,"White Sulphur Springs is small town to visit where you can get a glimpse into American history, visit nature parks, and experience luxury. Outdoorsmen and women will love its proximity to the Monongahela National Forest and explore the Greenbrier Valley Trail, where all types of activities are possible.

If you’re a history buff, stick around for the 1862 Battle of Dry Creek re-enactment that takes place every summer that will make you feel like you’ve stepped back into the Civil War Era. "
Point Pleasant,"Have kids? Then Point Pleasant is a small town you can’t miss while traveling through West Virginia. Older children will love attending the zany Mothman Festival, a weekend of festivities devoted to a creepy yet legendary winged and mysterious character. If you miss the festival – no worries, there’s an entire museum devoted to him too. Keep in mind that he might scare the tiny kids, though! All other times of the year, visit the West Virginia State Farm Museum, the Point Pleasant River Museum, and the Tu-Endie-Wei State Park. You’ll love this fun town filled with lighthearted locals who know better than to take life too seriously. "
"Douglas Falls, Davis, West Virginia","Davis is a small town at 3,200 feet, the highest elevation in the state, that is hidden among beautiful mountains. Many come here just to escape the heat during the hot West Virginian summers. It has the best of all four seasons but without the pain of extreme temperatures. It once was a lumber town, and still maintains its old-style architecture and atmosphere. Many of the nearby sites were once key components to the Civil War. Many love Davis because it’s located within ten miles of the Canaan Valley State Park and wildlife refuge, where you can swim, fish, go water skiing, and even white water rafting. "
Shepherdstown,"Located on the Potomac River just an hour and a half away from Washington D.C., Shepherdstown is a cultural hub with the heart of soul of West Virginia. There’s a strong café culture, where locals and visitors alike often spend the entire day lounging around Shepherdstown’s many interesting cafes.

Visit during the Chocolate Festival for an overload on all things chocolate – think tastings, workshops, paired wines, and more. "
"Thomas, West Virginia","Thomas is a small town that was once known for simply being an old coal mining hub without any glitz or glamour. Interestingly, the buildings that might have been considered bland at the time are now what make Thomas one of the most beautiful towns in West Virginia. After all, it has over fifty buildings listed on the National Historic Register! Many of these buildings have been turned into cafes, antique shops, and art galleries. Locals tend to gather at The Purple Fiddle, a venue serving sweet tunes and even sweeter homemade ice cream. You can also have a great time at the Mountain State Brewing Company, a local craft beer brewery serving fresh golden ale. "
"Buckhannon, West Virginia","You’d be hard-pressed to find an area with more resident artists in West Virginia, a small town conveniently located on the West Virginia Artist Gallery Trail.

Kingwood,"Kingwood’s colonial style architecture and manicured gardens make for an aesthetic treat for travelers looking to photograph beautiful destinations. Even the old gas station still has Mae West pumps and the McGrew house looks like it belongs in another century. Kingwood is also near the Monogahela National Forest where you can do all these outdoors around and along the Cheat River.

This festival includes a two hour parade, fireworks, live gospel performances, a 5k race, and more. Though it might just seem like a typical small town, Ripley is worth visiting because of its friendly locals. All throughout the state, Ripley is known for its hospitality and warmth towards all who visit. Ripley has the Appalachian Distillery, a locally owned and operated distillery where you can taste moonshine and even take a few bottles to go. "
Charles Town,"American history buffs need to make Charles Town a priority stop on their way through West Virginia. This little destination was named after Charles Washington, George’s little brother. He used Charles Town as the site for his personal home and safe haven, and it was a frequent gathering point for the entire Washington family at times. Charles Town also has areas that important Civil War battles took place and even more interestingly, was the site of a huge abolitionist raid. Today, people also love visiting the Bloomery Plantation Distillery for a fun and tasty experience, trying their luck at the Hollywood Casino, visiting the Old Opera House, and hopping on a  ghost tour. "
Harpers Ferry,"Harpers Ferry is a small town dropped right where there the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers meet. Most visit to see the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park which includes much of the town itself. Harpers Ferry changed hands fourteen times during the Civil War, meaning its steeped in history and significance. When you leave the park, be sure to walk along the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, stop by the St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, and walk to the top of Jefferson Rock. There are many other monuments to go to like John Brown’s Fort, The Point where three states come together, and the Harper House. You can also see how old antiques are restored at the Restoration Museum. If you’re into beauty and the past, then Harpers Ferry is an obvious stop for you for your trip. "
New Martinsville,"On the banks of the Ohio River is New Martinsville, a small town with a courthouse that looks like it belongs in a fairytale book or in a land of castles rather than West Virginia. It was once an oil and gas town but now thrives with smaller industries. New Martinsville has a great café and restaurant scene. Check out Quinet’s Court, Dos Hermanos Mexican grill, PJ’s Pizza, and the Barista’s Café and Pub. Come hungry and leave extremely satisfied. If you love spending time outside, the Beaver Creek Reservoir is the perfect place to swim, fish, hike, and even rent canoes. You can back a picnic and paddle yourself to a remote part of the reserve for a romantic getaway that’s cheap and easy to do. "
"Leeds, England","This city was reborn in the 1990s, bouncing back from the decline of the textile industry that was its lifeblood to become the second largest financial centre in the UK. The two universities also give <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/top-25-things-to-do-in-leeds-uk/"">Leeds</a> a youthful and alternative edge and it&#8217;s now a prosperous and dynamic city bursting with culture, dining, nightlife, shopping and sights. You have to see the beautiful amenities built for the wealthy citizens in 19th century, like the Leeds Corn Exchange, the City Varieties Music Hall and Grand Theatre, or the exquisite shopping arcades. The Exchange Quarter has become a stylish destination for nights out and dining, and there are first-class museums like the Royal Armouries and the Thackray Medical Museum. "
Bradford,"One of the big centres for the woollen textile industry, the city of <a href=""https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-bradford-england/"">Bradford</a> has kept hold of a great deal of its 18th and 19th century heritage. It doesn&#8217;t get grander than Little Germany, which got its name from the Germany Jewish merchants who constructed ornate warehouses to store and sell woollen goods manufactured in the local mills. These magnificent buildings have been converted, so Little Germany is still a thriving commercial district, with offices and places to shop. The Bradford Industrial Museum is in the former Moorside Mills and conserves printing and textile machinery, a lot of which has been kept in working order. And if you&#8217;re partial to Indian and Pakistani food you can&#8217;t go wrong in Bradford, which has some of the best curry restaurants in England. "
Wakefield,"In industrial times Wakefield was a textiles and coal city: In the village of Overton just to the southwest is the riveting National Mining Museum, in the buildings of the old Caphouse Colliery. For something more ancient, the spire of the medieval gothic cathedral is still the tallest structure in Wakefield, soaring to 75 metres. The cathedral was restored in the 19th century but if you go into the choir you&#8217;ll be in the former chancel, which has 15th-century bosses carved into the ceiling. Come back to modern times with the bold new Hepworth Gallery, named for the 20th-century sculptor Barbara Hepworth, a Wakefield native. More than 40 of her works are on show, as well as pieces by Henry Moore, who was born in Wakefield&#8217;s Castleford district. "
Halifax,"The large market town of Halifax has been spinning wool since the 1400s, and of course, this business really took off in the Industrial Revolution. For a humungous slab of industrial history, Dean Clough was one of the world&#8217;s biggest carpet factories when it was built in the mid-1850s. This Grade II-listed complex is slightly north of Halifax and along its half-mile length are now 150 local businesses, including a radio station. Shibden Hall is an older delight, with a Tudor timber-framed facade, and a team of volunteers happy to recount stories about former occupants of a manor that goes back to the 1400s. In the out-buildings are old workshops, preserving a traditional tannery, brewery, stables and basket-weaving shop. "
Huddersfield,"Now a university town, Huddersfield grew quickly in the 1700s when it was taken over by woollen textiles mills. For a voyage back to industrial times you could book a barge ride through the 3-mile-long Standedge Tunnels on the old Huddersfield Narrow Canal. The sandstone Castle Hill is just to the south of Huddersfield and was the site of some sort of fortification from the Bronze Age onwards. In 1899, to celebrate Victoria&#8217;s record-breaking silver jubilee, a 30-metre stone tower was placed at the crest. Make the walk for photo-worthy panoramas of Huddersfield laid out in the Holme and Colne valleys below. "
Ilkley,"In the 1700s the local spring was ascribed health-giving properties and Ilkley  became a spa town. Wealthy people would come from far and wide to take &#8220;hydropathic&#8221; treatments, and one of these was Charles Darwin in 1859, at the very time On the Origin of Species was being published. There&#8217;s still an upmarket atmosphere in Ilkley, underlined by the broad streets and sweet Victorian houses with independent shops, tea rooms and award-winning restaurants. Now people stay in Ilkley to escape to the Yorkshire Dales, and the 84-mile Dales Way trail starts at the Old Bridge right by the centre of town. Lastly, the All Saints Church is a blend of Victorian and medieval gothic architecture, but you need to look inside to see the three Saxon crosses, dating to the 8th century. "
"Saltaire, England","There was no such place as Saltaire until the 1850s when the industrialist Sir Titus Salt established his colossal woollen mill next to the River Aire and added streets of handsome cottages for his workers. This model village is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, &#8220;model&#8221; meaning a place of reference. All of the houses in Saltaire are listed buildings, and the most protected is the Unified Reformed Church, with an Italianate Classical design drawn up by Salt himself. In 1986 Jonathan Silver, the same man who helped to convert Halifax&#8217;s Dean Clough, bought Salt&#8217;s Mill and started turning it into shops, offices and leisure facilities. Don&#8217;t miss the gallery devoted to David Hockney, a native of Bradford. "
Keighley &#8211; Worth Valley Railway,"If ever there were a location that crystallises the spirit of the Brontë novels it&#8217;s Keighley. The National Trust property East Riddelsden Hall has actually been  a shooting location for a TV adaptation of Emily Brontë&#8217;s Wuthering Heights. While the countryside of the Keighley Moors and Airedale has the rugged sandstone hills that may send you into romantic reverie. Or you could sit back and watch the beautiful Worth Valley roll by on the Keighley and Worth Valley Heritage Railway, which still uses steam and diesel locomotives. In a moody Victorian manor is the Cliffe Castle Museum, which has all kinds of interesting oddities like Victorian costume, fossils, an Egyptian mummy, a mineral collection and machinery and tools relating to local trades and industry. "
Pontefract,"At one time the market town of Pontefract was said to have had the most pubs per square mile in Britain. While that can&#8217;t be true today there are lots of establishments to call in on for a pint and some warming grub. The big landmark is Pontefract Castle, which has been an eerie ruin since the 17th-century English Civil War when the royalist forces were besieged several times by the Parliamentarians. Earlier, King Richard II is claimed to have died in Pontefract Castle, and his supposed death at this place is mentioned in Shakespeare&#8217;s Richard III. "
Haworth,"Then immerse yourself even more in the mysterious world of the Brontë sisters at Haworth, where the former Brontë family property has been kept as a museum. All the three sisters spent the majority of their lives in this very house, and nearly all of the objects in the rooms belonged to them. Hike along the nature trail over the moors to the Brontë Waterfall, a picturesque walk southwest of the village. You could also show yourself around the Haworth parish church, where their father Patrick Brontë was the minister until 1861. "
Hebden Bridge,"Simultaneously picturesque and defiantly alternative, Hebden Bridge is populated by artists and new age types. The market town is described as the lesbian capital of the UK, home to a women-only disco and fabled music venue, the Trades Club. The likes of Damo Suzuki, Nico and Patti Smith have all played here. If you&#8217;re feeling fit you can make the climb up the steep hill to the village of Heptonstall. Road traffic is banned in this adorable little settlement so if you do come by car you&#8217;ll need to park up outside and enter the cobblestone lanes on foot. In the secondary graveyard at the St. Thomas the Apostle Church is the burial place of the beloved American poet Sylvia Plath. "
Holmfirth,"An adorable little town folded into the Peak District&#8217;s heather moorland, Holmfirth is all sandstone cottages and townhouses. The fondly-remembered BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed in the countryside and outside buildings around Holmfirth. Many people find themselves in the town for a gig at the Picturedrome, an old cinema converted into a live music venue where artists like Adam Ant and the Buzzcocks have all played. While others come for the the access to the majestic, undulating landscapes of the Holme Valley, a rambler&#8217;s dream. "
Otley,"Nestling in the Wharfdale valley, Otley&#8217;s a pretty town that J.M.W. Turner would often visit to paint and see his patron, Walter Ramsden Fawkes. Weave your way up through forest, heather and meadows to the summit of the Chevin, a 282-metre escarpment. On the way up there&#8217;s a megalithic boundary of big sandstone slabs lining the path. At &#8220;surprise view&#8221; you&#8217;re granted exhilarating vistas over Otley and lower Wharfdale, which opens out behind. The River Wharf is beautiful in Otley and a lot of the north bank is parkland taking in the weir and the solemn old tannery and wool mills by the water. "
Kirkstall Abbey,"Your main motivation to drive or get the train from Leeds City Centre to this northwestern suburb is for Kirkstall Abbey, a 12th-century Cistercian monastery that was left to fall into ruin after the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries. Despite being abandoned for 500 years the ruins are remarkably complete and great fun to explore, as the cloister, chapter house and church nave are all easy to identify. J.M.W. Turner also painted this scene in the 1797. "
"River Wharfe, Wetherby","The meandering River Wharfe in Wetherby is uncommonly picturesque and you can get down to the banks to see their weir and a large gear from a mill that used to stand here. The subject of most photos is Wetherby Bridge, which was built in the 1200s and was once on the Great North Road, running from London to Edinburgh. J.M.W. Turner came by in 1816 and painted this very scene. The local Wetherby Racecourse was known for being the only course in Yorkshire that not only hosted national hunt (jump) meetings, but put on its first flat race 2015. "
The Pinnacles,"The Pinnacles are probably the first thing that comes to mind when most people think of Western Australia (well, other than the quokka selfies phenomenon!) It’s a vast expanse of limestone formations in the middle of the desert; you can walk for hours in what really does feel like another planet! Scientists aren’t entirely sure how the Pinnacles were formed, but one thing is for sure: they’re incredible. They’re one of Australia’s most popular regional destinations for tourists, with approximately 150,000 visitors per year. The best season to visit the Pinnacles is Spring, before the WA summer gets too hot, and when you can enjoy stunning wildflowers on your drive through the desert. The best time of day is early morning or late afternoon, when you can enjoy the effect of the silhouettes of the limestone formations; if you’re lucky, you might even see a kangaroo or emu! "
Monkey Mia,"Monkey Mia is a childhood favorite of many “sandgropers” (the nickname for Western Australians); bottlenose dolphins have been swimming up to the shore for over half a century, to play and interact with human visitors (and to get a good feed!) It used to be possible for anyone to swim with and feed the dolphins, but as the site became more popular, the dolphins were spending too much time at shore and getting a bit too much to eat, so the site is now regulated by the Department of Parks and Wildlife and the number of people who can swim with the dolphins is limited, but you still get a very up-close-and-personal view even if you don’t have the chance to swim, so it’s well worth doing! The dolphins are very used to people, and very interactive; it’s also one of the only sites in the world where dolphins are actively coming to shore to play with humans. The Department also provides a fascinating educational commentary about dolphin society and about the site itself. While you’re in Monkey Mia, you can also take an Aboriginal cultural walk, ride a camel, or visit a working pearl farm. Monkey Mia is part of the Shark Bay Marine Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage listed site, so there’s plenty of other exciting places to explore while you’re around this part of WA. "
Mount Augustus,"Mount Augustus is the world’s largest rock; Western Australians like to joke that they’ve got no need to see “that other rock” (Uluru, aka Ayers Rock), because despite Uluru’s fame, WA has got a rock twice as big at 860 metres! It also appears to be different colors depending on the time of day (from a deep indigo to a bright pink), and it’s heavily vegetated, making it particularly eye-catching during wildflower season. There’s also ancient Aboriginal rock art, and stunning native flora and fauna in the area. "
Jewel Cave,"Jewel Cave is WA’s largest tourist cave, and as you can see from the photo, it is very aptly named! Its scenery is extraordinarily ethereal, and it is truly a sight to see in person. The spectacular array of stalactites and helictites are awe-inspiring, and you will be amazed by this beautiful work of nature thousands of years in the making. The cave also boasts one of the world’s largest straw stalactites! Guided tours are available, and they’re very informative. If you’d like to see more, there’s quite a few other beautiful tourist caves in the region: ask at the Margaret River tourist information centre for more information. "
Horizontal Waterfalls,"Nicknamed the “Horries”, these waterfalls are exactly what the name suggests: waterfalls that are horizontal, rather than vertical! This extremely unusual site was described by David Attenborough as “one of the greatest natural wonders of the world”, and it’s an intriguing and unique sight that you’ll never forget. "
Twilight Beach,"Esperance is a favorite holiday spot for locals and tourists alike. The beaches are stunning, with Twilight Beach voted the best in Australia! The atmosphere of the town is great, and there’s plenty of natural and cultural attractions to keep you occupied. The Historical Museum Village is a lot of fun, and gives you an insight into life in the early days of the town, as well as some fascinating architecture. It’s also a very child-friendly destination: there’s a bird and animal park, Adventureland Park, and a very authentic mini steam train. There are three national parks in the Shire of Esperance, boasting stunning natural beauty, and it’s a favorite spot on the WA wildflower trail as well. "
Kings Park,"Smack-dab in the middle of Perth city centre, you’ll find a massive park that’s a favorite respite from the rat race for local city-dwellers, and a must-see for tourists as well. The botanic gardens are a great introduction to native flora, much of which is unique to WA! 80 bird species also reside in this park, so it’s a treat for birdwatchers. Two-thirds of this 4  km2 park is bushland, made accessible by walking trails, and giving you a taste of what the land was like before the city was built. As the park is high upon a hill, you’ll also get a picture-perfect view of the city and the Swan River from the Fraser Avenue Precinct area, and it’s worth coming back again at sunset to enjoy the panorama of city lights. "
"Vineyard,Margaret River","Margaret River is a quaint little tourist town that’s famous for wineries and surfing, but has much more to offer: the town boasts many local artisan crafts and gourmet delights, such as the Margaret River Fudge Factory, and 9 local breweries (and a thriving bar scene, of course!) You’ll also find delicious heirloom fruits and vegetables at the farmers’ market. Margaret River is a great place to base yourself while exploring the attractions of the wider region: Jewel Cave, Busselton Jetty, and the Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse are all a short drive away. There’s often interesting events going on in the town or nearby; check at the tourist information centre or online to see what’s happening during your trip. "
Scarborough Beach,"This is one of Perth’s most popular beaches, and it’s great fun for a swim in summer or to enjoy the Perth tradition of beachside fish and chips. It’s a popular spot for people in their teens and early 20s to catch up, relax and sunbathe; it can get a little busy, so if you’re traveling with little ones in tow, you might want to check out Mullaloo Beach a bit further north up the coast. "
Broome,"Broome is a beach resort town that’s a popular base for exploring the Kimberley region, but the town has a lot to offer too! The town is a great spot to learn about Aboriginal Australian culture, and it’s also known internationally for its high-quality pearls, whale-watching and kayaking. You can even ride a camel here! Nearby Cable Beach and the Dampier Peninsula are gorgeous, and the Malcolm Douglas Crocodile Park and Animal Refuge are a great way to see some Aussie animals; watching the crocodiles get fed is a lot of fun! "
Valley of the Giants,"Just over 400km south of Perth, this little town is a beloved getaway for locals, and a popular wedding spot. There’s lots to see and do in Denmark: Bartholomews Meadery boasts a great range of mead and other honey products (the chocolate honey is particularly delicious!), and Dinosaur World has a collection of skeletons that includes the only T-Rex in Australia. The nearby Valley of the Giants treetop walk boasts some stunning scenery as you walk through the forest canopy at 40m high. There’s also lots of delicious local produce and wines to enjoy, and at the Wine and Truffle Company you can even go on a guided truffle hunt! "
Fremantle,"Fremantle is a funky cultural centre just south of Perth city centre, with beautifully preserved heritage buildings, a vibrant bar scene, and great boutique shopping and restaurants. There’s plenty of tourist spots to enjoy: Fremantle Prison does spooky guided night tours, the award-winning Little Creatures Brewery is a hipster hangout with delicious food and beer, and at the Fremantle Markets there’s an eclectic range of stalls, from stylish vintage clothes to cronuts. "
Brierley Jigsaw Gallery,"Bridgetown is a gorgeous, little-known town about 3 hours south of Perth, with a very arty culture and very Aussie architecture! Have a wander around the town centre and enjoy the atmosphere, and then check out the Brierley Jigsaw Gallery (home of the world’s smallest wooden jigsaw!). There’s a Christmas shop that’s open all year round, and an adorably old-world candy store called Ooh la Lollipop that’s a feast for the eyes and tummy alike. Wag Walters Emporium is another adorable vintage goods store that is a fun place to find some souvenirs for your friends back home. "
Wolfe Creek,"This national park was relatively unknown until the very creepy horror movie, Wolf Creek, gave it perhaps more publicity than any other national park in the country. The movie was inspired by an actual murder in the area, and while it was mostly filmed in South Australia, the Wolfe Creek crater does feature in the movie and its sequel. The crater itself is a truly eerie sight: it is almost 900 metres in diameter, and was created by the impact of a meteorite around 300,000 years ago. It’s considered the second most ‘obvious’ (un-deformed by erosion) meteorite impact crater on Earth, and is well worth a visit. It’s particularly beautiful to see during sunrise or sunset. The site doesn’t have much in the way of tourist facilities, and no water is available, so stock up before you go on the barren desert drive, especially in summer! "
Kalbarri,"Kalbarri is located at the mouth of the Murchinson river, and boasts a wide variety of gorgeous natural scenery, from seaside cliffs to inland gorges and stunning beaches. The local pelican colony is adorable, and well-fed by tourists, and you can also find the largest free-flight parrot aviary in the country here! There’s also a thriving art scene for you to pick up some knick-knacks. In Spring, this is a great spot for wildflowers and whale and dolphin-watching, and in Summer the town is a great place to relax on the beach with your family. Visit the tourist information centre for information on walking tours and nature trails, and don’t forget to visit the Pink Lake, an amazing natural phenomenon (exactly what it sounds like – a bright-pink lake!) that’s a perfect backdrop to make your friends on Instagram and Snapchat wish they’d come along for the trip! "
"Salisbury, England","Historic Salisbury is a beautifully-presented city drenched in medieval heritage, and one of the main ports of call for tourists in Wiltshire. And this is no mystery when you see the cathedral and uncover the riveting history within its walls. This sensational 13th-century building has the oldest working clock in the world, from 1386, and it has the best-preserved of the four copies of the Magna Carta. The cathedral is compulsory, but just one of many things to get excited about. The Salisbury is a great accompaniment to nearby Stonehenge and Wiltshire&#8217;s Bronze Age monuments,  while on a hilltop north of Salisbury is Old Sarum, where the old city and cathedral once stood. There had been a settlement here from the Bronze Age to the 13th century when the cathedral was moved to its current location. "
Bradford on Avon,"The west side of the county is in the lower reaches of the Cotswold Hills, and the combination of that mellow limestone and Bradford&#8217;s historical wealth makes Bradford unmissable. The town got rich from the woollen textile trade in the 1600s when a lot of its present architecture was built, and with its winding topography it&#8217;s a very rewarding place to see on foot. The loveliest sight of all is the medieval bridge, which has a chapel that was later converted into a lockup to hold troublemakers overnight. There&#8217;s a surprising amount to get through in Bradford, but the 10th-century Saxon church of St Laurence, the 14th-century Tithe Barn and the Arts and Crafts-style gardens at Iford Manor, need to be in your plans. "
"Stonehenge, Amesbury","There&#8217;s evidence of human settlement going back more than 10,000 years at Amesbury, which makes it by far the oldest settlement in the country to have been continuously inhabited. If there&#8217;s one thing to see around Amesbury it has to be Stonehenge, which hardly needs introducing. This ring of monumental stones goes back to 3000 BC and it&#8217;s mind-boggling to think that these enormous stones travelled from as far as Pembrokeshire in Wales. Be sure to linger in the town for a while to see the Church of St Mary and St Melor, which was once Amesbury Abbey, founded in the 10th century and the burial place Henry III&#8217;s wife, Eleanor of Provence who died in Amesbury in 1291. "
Avebury,"For a small village in the middle of the downs, Avebury has got a lot going for it. First up are the Neolithic stone circles, which are part of the same World Heritage Site as Stonehenge. This henge dates back 5,000 years and took centuries to complete. The stones hold a lot of significance for modern paganists, and it&#8217;s not uncommon to see people dressed as druids here! But for everyone else they&#8217;re a mysterious and enthralling monument to a time when people were first joining together in farming communities in one of Britain&#8217;s most fertile regions. Avebury Manor is right by the stone circles and is a delight, dating to the mid-1500s and with wood-panelled rooms and walled formal gardens outside. "
Devizes,"Even in a county replete with fetching market towns Devizes will stay with you after you leave. The centre is very well-preserved, with more than 500 listed buildings. So you can pick up many different threads to learn more about the town and Wiltshire&#8217;s past. One of these is the Wadworth Brewery, still delivering ale by shire horse after almost 150 years and happy to show you around the brew house. Then there&#8217;s the Georgian industrial engineering of Caen Hill, where a flight of 16 locks conduct canal traffic up or down the hill. And the Wiltshire Museum is a fab attraction that will bring you face-to-face with the Bronze Age treasures buried with chieftains in their barrows. "
Marlborough High Street,"This old and distinguished market town is a dream to explore and has a singular appearance because of its very wide high street. This is the second-widest in the whole of England, in fact, and this provides and ample berth for the weekly markets that take place on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Just wandering around Marlborough&#8217;s well-preserved streets, home to pubs, tea rooms and antiques shops, it&#8217;s not hard to tell that the town has enjoyed long periods of wealth. The silk trade is to thank for one of these, and you can drop by the Merchant&#8217;s House on the high street to learn how a wealthy 17th-century businessman would have lived. "
"Cricklade, England","The River Thames flirts with the northwestern corner of Wiltshire, and passes the town of Cricklade when it is little more than a stream. Even a town as small as Cricklade has enough history to put together a heritage trail, which will show you around some interesting sights like two medieval churches, a 13th-century priory, the Jenner Hall which is from the 1600s and a strange-looking clock designed to commemorate Victoria&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee in the late-1800s. The countryside is as beautiful here as anywhere in Wiltshire, and in early Spring the North Meadow National Nature Reserve erupts into bloom thanks to its many, rare wild snakeshead fritillaries. "
Museum of the Great Western Railway,"The closest thing in Wiltshire to an urban centre, Swindon differs from the rest of the county as it&#8217;s a modern-looking hub for business and education, and has an industrial legacy. The acclaimed Museum of the Great Western Railway is on the site of the Swindon Works, which is what kept this famous line operational, at one time producing three new steam locomotives every week. The museum charts the age of steam travel, with a fleet of engines including the GWR Star Class North Star, designed by Robert Stephenson himself in 1838. The hi-tech businesses based around Swindon make it an appropriate location for the Museum of Computing, but if you can&#8217;t do without a hit of old-school glamour Lydiard Park is in the grounds of a regal Palladian manor house. "
Lacock,"You&#8217;ll have to go a long way to find a prettier village than Lacock in Wiltshire&#8217;s Cotswolds. You may wonder if you&#8217;ve walked into a fairytale, as every house brims with rustic charm. This ensemble of timber-framed and weathered limestone buildings is under the care of the National Trust, and it won&#8217;t be news to hear that a lot of TV shows and movies (including two Harry Potter films) have been filmed here. Lacock Abbey is a nunnery that became a stately home after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1500s. Also belonging to the National Trust, this exquisite stone building is an engaging melange of styles and has loads of its original features, like a bakery and brewery in its Tudor courtyards. "
"Tithe Barn, Tisbury","In the West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Tisbury is an endearing village on the Nadder River, a crystal-clear chalk stream noted for its brown trout. Tisbury flourished in the middle ages when its quarries provided the stone for Salisbury cathedral. There are lots of curious sights to keep in mind, like the Grade I-listed parish church, which has a 4,000-year-old yew, the second oldest tree in Britain, in its yard. Then you have the 13th-century Tithe Barn, which has the largest thatched roof in England. But if you see only one thing in this area it has to be the 14th-century Wardour Castle, damaged during a five-day siege in the Civil War and now a romantic and well-formed ruin that often appears in movies and TV shows. "
Warminster,"The town of Warminster in the southwest of the country has lots to recommend it and owes a lot of its present character to the corn trade and one George Wansey, a wealthy cloth merchant who donated a fortune to have Warminster spruced up in the early 1800s. The town has more bustle and nightlife than all of the surrounding villages put together, but Warminster&#8217;s allure comes from its proximity to two of rural England&#8217;s favourite days out. Stourhead is a country house and garden par excellence, while the Elizabethan Longleat Manor is also outstanding, but also includes Longleat Safari Park, the award-winning and hugely popular wildlife attraction. "
Malmsbury Abbey House Formal Gardens,"Moated by two branches of the River Avon, Malmesbury is another of northwestern Wiltshire&#8217;s Cotswold towns, and is equally historic and beautiful. This was one of Alfred the Great&#8217;s main fortifications against the Vikings in the late-9th century, while Malmesbury Abbey has been here since the 600s and was in constant use until it was dissolved by Henry VIII. The abbey is the burial place of Athelstan, King of the Anglo-Saxons up to 939. Right next to the abbey and incorporating some of its buildings after the monastery was dissolved is the Old Bell Inn. This is the oldest hotel in England, catering for guests since 1220. "
Wilton House,"Just west of Salisbury, Wilton has a genteel air for its quoined 17th and 18th-century buildings, and a church that almost seems extravagant for such a small place. As the name will tell you, Wilton was once Wiltshire&#8217;s county town, a role it played until the 1000s. And the reason for so much grand Georgian architecture is the weaving industry, which boomed in the town for hundreds of years. Valuable Wilton Carpets are still weaved in the town today, even it&#8217;s on a smaller scale than in old times. For some sightseeing, Wilton House is unbelievably lavish, with State Rooms decorated with portraits by Anthony van Dyck of the landed Herbert Family in the 17th-century. "
Pewsey White Horse,"For centuries the grassy hillsides in England&#8217;s West Country have been decorated with monumental works of art by exposing the white chalk below. In Wiltshire they take the form of a white horse. There are eight around the county, and one of the more recent is the Pewsey White Horse, which rises above the cornfields in the bucolic Pewsey Vale. With its thatched cottages, the small town of Pewsey is a very agreeable place to spend an afternoon, connecting with a few public rights of way and with a clutch of friendly pubs to call in on. Follow the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal east to the Crofton Pumping Station, which is more than 200 years old and uses a functioning beam engine to pump water from a stream to replenish the canal. "
Castle Combe,"A fitting place to round off the list, Castle Combe is billed as one of the prettiest villages in England and an essential stop in the Cotswolds. When you take in the scene on the By Brook it may be hard to disagree. Castle Combe is a lovely jumble of cottages made from rusticated Cotswold stone. Many of these were built for weavers during the days of the wool trade in the 1600s. The Grade I listed parish church here has an effigy of a Sir Walter de Dunstanville from 1270, and his crossed legs indicate that he fought in the Crusades. "

Worcester,"Affluent and exceedingly pretty in places, Worcester is the county town and is an unexpected mix of the very old and new. So on Friar Street and New Street, rows of Tudor houses are interrupted by an occasional office block from the post-war period. But this does little to break the spell. Worcester Cathedral is the city&#8217;s crowning glory, adored for its central tower, chapter house and early Norman crypt. Greyfriars, a former Franciscan friary, has a rustic courtyard and is held as Worcester most beautiful half-timbered house. Worcester was also the birthplace of the vaunted composer, Sir Edmund Elgar, and the cottage he was born in has a first-rate museum celebrating this English cultural giant. "
Great Malvern,"A spa resort for the upper crust in the 1800s, Malvern is now an endearing assortment of connected villages around a historic centre known as Great Malvern. Generations of visitors have descended on this location for the spring waters and to hike the Malvern Hills, an extremely ancient igneous formation. Cresting high above Great Malvern is Worcestershire Beacon, 425 metres up and a signalling point at momentous occasions in England&#8217;s past, such as during the Spanish Armada in 1588. On the hill&#8217;s lower reaches is Great Malvern Priory, established in the 1000s but with most of its work done in the 1400s. Go in to admire the carved misericords in the choir, the abundance of medieval floor and wall tiles and the many original 15th-century stained glass windows. "
Tenbury Wells,"A cultivated little town on the Teme, Tenbury Wells is quite rare as its centre has very few chain stores. This of course lends the town a character you won&#8217;t often find in England for a place of this size. Many of the buildings here are even older than they look, because a lot of the 17th-century timber houses were given brick facades, as was the fashion in the 19th century. The two pubs, Royal Oak and Pembroke House, show off their original timber frames and are quaintly off kilter. Even Tenbury Wells&#8217; new architecture manages to be noteworthy: The Regal Cinema from 1937 is art deco at its loveliest, and actually integrates with an 18th-century townhouse. "
Bewdley,"On  the Severn, and with a bridge built by the Regency engineer Thomas Telford, Bewdley is an lovable old town of tall flat-fronted townhouses. This place has been catering to visitors for many years, and there&#8217;s no lack of things for families to get up to. On foot from Bewdley you can access the Wyre Forest for placid walks and where there&#8217;s an adventure park for kids. You&#8217;re also in touching distance of the West Midlands Safari Park and the Severn Valley Railway, a heritage line mostly pulled by steam trains. And if you have a taste for real ale, the Bewdley Brewery will show you how it&#8217;s done. "
Broadway,"Even in the Cotswolds, where almost every settlement is delightful, Broadway shines brighter than most. The name of the village comes from an ancient ridgeway that people would use to get from Worcester to London. The high street is the &#8220;Broadway&#8221;, a wide road lined with mellow stone-built cottages and mansions, most from the 17th century. The scene is enough to melt your heart. There&#8217;s also some weighty cultural interest in Broadway, as it was at the core of the early-20th-century Arts and Crafts movement, and was settled by luminaries like Elgar, William Morris and John Singer Sargent, to name but three. For country rambles try ascending Fish Hill, or Broadway Hill, which is capped by a romantic medieval-style folly from 1794. "
"Almonry Heritage Centre, Evesham","An old market town in the Cotswolds&#8217; northern foothills, Evesham once had one of Europe&#8217;s largest abbeys. This monastery was suppressed and town down in the 1500s, but the Almonry, where alms were dispensed, has an engrossing museum about Eveham&#8217;s medieval glory inside a half-timbered hall. The solemn gothic bell tower is all this is left of the abbey church, and stands in a park where the grounds used to be. The River Avon and the parkland on its banks, certainly adds to Evesham&#8217;s allure, opening up possibilities for boating and countryside walks. If you do strike out into the countryside you&#8217;ll be in a region feted for its fertile soils fostering apples, plums and asparagus. So maybe you could time your trip to coincide with the marvellous blossoms in early spring. "
Pershore,"Also in the Vale of Evesham, Pershore has the same legacy of market gardening, and orchards for pears and plums surround this respectable market town. In August there&#8217;s even the annual Plum Festival, when all sorts of twee events go down, like the crowning of the &#8220;Plum Princess&#8221;. On Broad Street and Bridge Street you can study the many listed Georgian buildings on a light saunter, and there&#8217;s even more historical fascination at Pershore Abbey. You&#8217;ll tell from this building&#8217;s odd footprint that it was partially destroyed in the 16th century, but it lives on as a parish church an contains a remarkable Norman font. For hikes try the 300-metre Bredon Hill, the final northern spur of the Cotswolds. "
Stourport-on Severn,"This town is a bit different because it only came to be in the late-18th century, at the site where the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canals entered the River Severn. This made it a pivotal distribution centre for everything from Black Country coal and iron to ceramics from the Potteries in the north. The canal basins here have been sensitively restored in the last couple of decades and exude Georgian refinement. There&#8217;s a heritage trail around this old infrastructure, and naturally the canals are a attraction in their own right if you fancy hiring a narrowboat. For smaller family members there&#8217;s the Treasure Island Amusement Park and the more sedate Little Owl Farm Park, where they can feed pygmy goats and piglets and see newly-hatched chicks in summer. "
"Chateau Impney, Droitwich","This town sits on a massive underground brine reservoir, so salty that the water that comes to the surface is ten times stronger than seawater. The Romans were the first to exploit the salt deposits, fittingly naming the settlement Salinae. By the 1800s people were flocking to bathe in the brine to relieve muscle and joint complaints, earning Droitwich its spa appellation. In summer you can still swim in Droitwich&#8217;s brine at the hugely popular lido, a large outdoor pool complex. In mid-September there&#8217;s also a Salt Festival, when there are Roman re-enactments,  ale bars and market stalls. At any other time you can potter around the high street, which has a historic character for its timber-framed shops. "
Bromsgrove,"Less tourism-oriented than the other destinations here, Bromsgrove is a busy town a few miles outside Birmingham. But if you&#8217;re planning in a flying visit there&#8217;s much more in Bromsgrove than meets the eye. At Stoke Heath is the superb Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, where almost 30 structures dating back hundreds of years have been saved from demolition and relocated at an outdoor museum. Also included is a large set of telephone booths, once a fixture of almost every street in the country. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal attracts people for its serene towpaths and narrowboating; a short way from Bromsgrove are the Tardebigge Locks, a flight of 30 locks in just over two miles. "
Forge Mill Needle Museum,"In the same vein as Bromsgrove, Redditch is a working town whose early fame was built on  manufacturing. The needle-making craft here went back to medieval times, but by the 1800s Redditch was the needle capital of the world, manufacturing nine out of ten of the world&#8217;s needles. So it&#8217;s only right that the town should remember this legacy at the Forge Mill Needle Museum. There&#8217;s vintage machinery, models depicting factory scenes and regular workshops to show how fishing tackle needles for the textile industry were made on this site more than a century ago. If you&#8217;re not needled-out by now, you can an also see the Old Needle Works, or get some light entertainment at the Palace Theatre or play a round at one of Redditch&#8217;s golf courses. "
Kidderminster Station,"Finishing up in the north of county, Kidderminster is a large town that may not win awards for its looks, but radiates a certain charm for its Victorian chimney stacks and old weaving mills. One of these is the formidable Stour Vale Mill, which is now the venue for the Museum of Carpet. If industrial machinery catches your imagination, come by at noon on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays to see the immense Victorian power loom in action. For more of Worcestershire&#8217;s country refinement, Hartlebury Castle is a Manor House hosting the Worcestershire County Museum, while a nostalgic trip on the Severn Valley Railway is always a crowd-pleaser. "
"Sinks Canyon, Lander, Wyoming","In the centre of Wyoming, on the upper plains of the Rockies is Lander. The incredibly lucky population of 8000 has America’s most spectacular mountain range as their backyard. Visiting Lander means visiting local breweries, jam sessions at a local pub, and every outdoor adventure you could want. It’s most popular time of year is during the three-day International Climber’s Festival. Drawing climbers from all over the globe, the town offers free camping and plenty of fun. Don’t forget to visit one of the many dude ranches, they year-round Pioneer Days Rodeo (the world’s oldest paid rodeo), and the state fair – held each winter! Sinks Canyon State Park is also nearby. "
"Jackson, Wyoming","At the south end of Jackson Hole is the town of Jackson. It has a western flair, but still manages to be contemporary. Shopping, great dining, and lots of entertainment. Any town with an arch make entirely out of elk antlers is bound to be entertaining. This is the best gateway to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and can be a great base camp. Check out the mountain formations that the locals call the Sleeping Indian, as well as the National Elk Refuge. One of the town’s most interesting features are the wood plank sidewalks – which locals have been strolling down for over 100 years. One of the not-to-be-missed attractions is the aerial tram. Bring your camera. "
"Buffalo, Wyoming","Buffalo is most famous as the location of an old western mystery drama called Longmire. But there is so much more to experience here. Right in the foothills of the Bighorn Mountains, Buffalo has a lot of history. There’s the 130+ year old Occidental Hotel. Both Teddy Roosevelt and Butch Cassidy once stayed there. You can also visit the Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum, first opened in 1900. All of downtown is well preserved and a real delight to ramble through. Outside of town, head to the mountains for skiing, boating, photography, and more. If you’re lucky, catch the three day Americana festival which highlights bluegrass music and even has a fiddle contest. "
"Cody, Wyoming","William Cody, also known as Buffalo Bill, was a legend in his own time. He had a hand in planning the town of Cody, Wyoming. It was said he took a lot of pride in the place and made sure there were plenty of museums – like the Buffalo Bill Historical Centre – to help locals remember their past. Today it’s considered the rodeo capital of the world. Combine that with awe-inspiring landscape, easy access to Yellowstone National Park, and the origin of the Beartooth Highway, and Cody would be high on anyone’s ‘must see’ list. With a population around 10,000, it’s easily considered one of the most beautiful places in the state. Try to catch the Wyoming Outdoors annual banquet, Mule Days, and the Plains Indian Museum Powwow. "
"Dubois, Wyoming","Dubois is one of the smaller towns on this list. Just around 1000 folks call it home and its remoteness in the northwest part of the state lends it tons of charm. Surrounded by the Rockies, the Wind River Mountains, and the Absarokas, it’s a genuine Western town where modern day cowboys walk the streets. Sometimes called ‘Never Sweat’ thanks to the climate, you’ll find so much big sky and beauty that you’ll never want to leave. American Cowboy Magazine once voted Dubois one of the best rural towns. Enjoy ranch activities, hiking, and the Centennial Scenic Byway – which stretches through the badlands and into the high peaks. "
"Centennial, Wyoming","Year-round recreation can be found in the tiny town of Centennial. At the bottom of the Snowy Range Mountains, the 300 some locals are big on hospitality. In the late 19th century, gold was discovered on Centennial Mountain. After just two years, the main vain disappeared into a fault line and was never picked up again. Though prospectors are still looking for it today! Visitors enjoy Thunder Basin National Grassland and Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest. Together they cover almost three million acres extending all the way in to Colorado. "
"Gillette, Wyoming","One of the more cosmopolitan towns in Wyoming is Gillette. Known as the Energy Capital of the nation thanks to the large supply of natural resources there, it’s also sometimes referred to as the manliest city in the state. Rodeo, hunting, and fishing are popular pass times, as are hockey and motor cross. Gillette is close enough to be a home base for trips to Mount Rushmore and Devils Tower. Be sure to visit the Eagle Butte Coal Mine, the Rockpile Museum, and the Gillette Brewing Company. "
"Sundance, Wyoming","Sundance is an energetic town. Named for the sun dances that American Indians held each year in this area, the town has a lot of history and couples that with a progressive atmosphere. Located in the Black Hills, the town embraces and celebrates its American Indian heritage. You can visit the Vore Buffalo Jump to learn more about the unique way of life for the Plain Indians. Fishermen love this town thanks to incredible spots like Keyhole Reservoir and Sand Creek. If you want more outdoors, try hiking horseback riding, cross country skiing, snowmobiling, and four-wheeling. This is one of the best combinations of small town charm with big city thinking. "
"Sheridan, Wyoming","Wyoming’s ‘Jewel’ is Sheridan. With a dramatic mountain backdrop, its won numerous awards including American Hunter’s top 10 mountain towns, a top western town, and one of the best towns by Outside Magazine. People come from across the state for Sheridan’s Bighorn Country USA annual festival and rodeo. Downtown has several spots listed on the National Register of Historic Places and allows you to get a real sense of old west Wyoming. With the Bighorn Mountains next door visitors can camp, boat, bike, or grab a camera and spend days photographing Sheridan’s amazing beauty. Be sure to check out the many ancient geological formations and ceremonial sites nearby. "
"Ten Sleep, Wyoming","Another great town near the Bighorn Mountains is Ten Sleep. It’s a cattle and sheep ranching town. If you walk down main street, you’ll find Ten Sleep Mercantile. Still open to this day and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Once an area of many battles between European settlers and American Indians, Ten Sleep is much more of a, well, sleepy town these days. You’ll find cattle ranchers, mountain climbers, and hippies in town. Named after the American Indian way of measuring distance, the area was ‘ten sleeps’ between two Sioux Indian camps. It makes a great stop on the way to Yellowstone, but don’t go too fast. Be sure to visit Ten Sleep Canyon. It rises into the mountains just outside of town and is one of the most popular climbing destinations in the country. "
"Story, Wyoming","Story is the place to come if you’re looking to slow your pace. Almost every spot in town is perfect for sitting back, relaxing, and taking in the fantastic view. Around 900 people call Story home many of them eclectic! It rose in popularity when residents of the ‘big city’ of Sheridan wanted to get away from it all. There are plenty of cabins designed for the weekend traveller. There’s really only two seasons there: summer and winter. The two most popular tourist attractions are Fort Phil Kearny and the Wagon Box battleground – now a National Historic Landmark. "
"Thermopolis, Wyoming","One of the planets largest mineral hot springs is in Thermopolis, Wyoming. Soak and take in the scenery while your mind and body relax in the springs. It’s located inside Hot Springs State Park. Visiting the springs is free, and has been since the late 19th century, thanks to a treaty signed between the US government and American Indian tribes. Families love the Dinosaur Centre and wonderful traditional handicrafts markets. Nearby are Wind River and Bighorn Canyons. "
"Wind River Mountains &#8211; Pinedale, Wyoming","This is a rugged town with 360 degrees of scenery. Pinedale is, at first glance, the kind of place you might rush through on your way to Jackson Hole or the Wind River Mountains. But you’ll regret it if you don’t stop at this traditional ranch town. It’s the perfect place to take children because there is an abundance of educational and historical attractions. You’ll enjoy the feeling of going back in time. The many parks and wilderness areas have plenty of wildlife and birding to view. White Pine Ski Area is one of the most popular ski destinations in the state and helps Pinedale earn its reputation as Wyoming’s winter destination spot. Don’t miss the Pronghorn Wildlife Corridor or the Museum of the Mountain Man. "
"Powell, Wyoming","If you’re looking for friendly, look no further than Powell. Once voted an All-American City. Located between the Absaroka Range and the Bighorn Mountains, this town is known for great weather and playing crucial roles in many frontier stories. It’s an agricultural town that blends old fashioned values with forward thinking. "
"Rock Springs, Wyoming","Three hours from Salt Lake City, Utah, is Rock Springs. It’s got everything an outdoor enthusiast is looking for. Named a top 10 water city by Livability.com, Rock Springs has the Green River and the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area to play in! Once a coal mining town, the energy market is booming there. It manages to live in harmony with the old fashioned Big Show Rodeo that most Wyomingite’s love. Butch Cassidy once worked in Rock Springs as a butcher – and that’s just the tip of the iceberg for the history that this town has. Locals like to say that they are the city of 56 nationalities. So many immigrants during the coal mining days have created a unique and rich culture that’s definitely worth checking out. "
Lake Kariba,"Cascading down to the banks of Lake Kariba in a patchwork of acacia trees, palms, rosewoods and forest figs, the verdant town of Siavonga has established itself as one of the premier holidaying spots in all of Zambia. It&#8217;s peppered with excellent hotels that boast sunning terraces and cafes overlooking the water, while boats bob along the shoreline and the hills of the Zambezi Valley erupt all across the horizon. On this – the largest reservoir in the world – it&#8217;s possible to enjoy oodles of watersports and recreational activities, while Siavonga itself is fringed by pretty beaches and walking trails. "
Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park,"The legendary &#8216;Smoke which Thunders&#8217;, Mosi-oa-Tunya is home to some of the most striking and unforgettable sections of the Victoria Falls. As the second-largest single cataract on the globe, it&#8217;s easy to see why that part of Zambia&#8217;s mighty river has garnered itself a UNESCO heritage tag. And when you add in the populations of white rhinos, Angolan giraffes, zebras and the occasional elephant that also tread this way, it&#8217;s even easier to see why quite so many visitors flock to this corner of the country every year. You&#8217;ll need good walking boots and a daring disposition at hand, ready for the narrow platforms of the so-called Knife-Edge Bridge that arches over the falls themselves! "
Kasanka National Park,"A pint-sized place close to the straight-line border with the DRC in the middle of Zambia, Kasanka offers up a curious cross-section of Central African fauna. Pangolins and mongoose stalk the countryside, while sable antelopes and hartebeest coalesce on the grassy meadows. Granted, there are few – if any – of the so-called Big Five game here, but there are other, more niche opportunities, to encounter the continental ecology – think meandering boat journeys and fishing outings on the  Luwombwa River, sitatunga antelope stalking amidst the swamps, and some of the most amazing bat migrations known to man! "
Kitwe,"Kitwe has risen and risen in the last century to become one of Zambia&#8217;s most populous towns. Today, more than half a million folk call this one their home; most of whom sweat and toil away in the copper mines that first brought money to this corner of Central Africa. When you arrive, you&#8217;ll be able to see the consequences of the booming mining industries here. They loom in the form of metal rigs above the dusty ground, and pop up amidst the stalls of the city&#8217;s Obote Ave Market – look for the curious handmade copper trinkets. Kitwe is also perfectly placed for further explorations among the towns of the greater Copperbelt. "
Livingstone,"The onetime capital of Zambia now bears the honorific moniker of perhaps the most famous explorer of the African continent who ever lived: David Livingstone. In fact, the place is a fitting memorial to the Scottish expeditionary and anti-slavery campaigner, not least of all because it&#8217;s the gateway to the roaring cataracts of the Victoria Falls (Livingstone is said to have been the first explorer to have set eyes on the wonder!). It&#8217;s also one of the best-loved places for safari goers and adventure travelers heading to Central Africa, famed for its ease-of-access to the legendary Zambezi National Park (in Zimbabwe), and the whitewater rapids of the Zambezi River to boot! "
Nsumbu National Park,"Ranging from the sandy shores of Lake Tanganyika to the scrub-clad hills of the country&#8217;s Northern Province, the Nsumbu National Park is a diverse and enthralling experience of the Central African hinterland. It&#8217;s also something of a wildcard safari choice, only opening to mainstream visitors in the last couple of decades with the inauguration of gravel road connections to Kawambwa. Highlights of the park include the gorgeous reaches of Kasaba Bay, where elephants can be seen wandering the swamps, and the meanders of the Lufubu River, which host everything from snapping crocs to water buffalo. "
Soweto Market,"The place where Zambia&#8217;s go-getters and entrepreneurs flock in search of opportunity, Lusaka is a throbbing city of mercantile types. Its markets – like the sprawling Soweto Market and its medley of shamanist and used car part stalls – burst with chatter, as locals haggle their way through the wares. Minibuses purr up and down the tarmacked roads, and there are new high-rise construction projects marking many of the corners (a sign that this capital is on the up!). The interesting Cathedral of the Holy Cross in the heart of the city is worth a gander, and so are the enlightening exhibitions of the National Museum. "
South Luangwa National Park,"One of the homes of the celebrated walking safari, the South Luangwa National Park spreads out between the rising mountains of eastern Zambia. It&#8217;s trodden by elephant herds and hippos, countless buffalos and long-necked giraffes, straddling miombo woods and swaying savannah plains. The biodiversity  makes it something of a picture of quintessential Africa, and the addition of lion prides does well to add to the rep. You&#8217;ll be able to stroll the hinterland in the company of pastoralist guides, learning all about animal tracking, anti-poaching and conservation. "
Kafue National Park,"The oldest national park in all of Zambia is a real treat for those in search of a bona fide African safari experience. Covering over 20,000 square kilometers, it remains one of the largest protected game areas on the continent, and boy does the biodiversity speak for itself! You&#8217;ll spot rare antelopes on the plains, and the elusive cheetah (hardly seen in these parts at all) stalking the riverine woods. You&#8217;ll get the chance to encounter African wild dogs on the grasses, and see them prowling their territories in the company of elephants (there are an estimated 4,000 individuals here) and monitor lizards alike. It&#8217;s all pretty bucket-list-busting stuff… "
Lower Zambezi National Park,"One of Zambia&#8217;s more off-the-beaten-track wildernesses lies between the borders of the Lower Zambezi National Park; a place yet untouched by the onslaught of mass safari going and ecotourism. A patchwork of muddy banks and miombo gallery woods, the 4,000-square-kilometer area is known for its vast floodplain. This seasonal wetland magnetizes groups of lions and elephants, buffalo and leopard, which all congregate here to water and feed. Lower Zambezi can&#8217;t be reached by paved road, so a 4X4 or a chartered flight connection (a great way to survey the wilds of southern Zambia) is entirely necessary. "
Mukuyu Slave Tree,"Ndola is the commercial epicenter of Zambia&#8217;s Copperbelt Province; one of the industrious kingpins of the nation. Butting right up to the border with the DRC, it&#8217;s a well-kempt town of neat streets and urban green spots, which makes a nice change from the frenetic energy of the country&#8217;s capital at Lusaka. Despite having overtly lived-in vibes, there are a few interesting little touristic points to see, like the termite-devoured Mukuyu Slave Tree, where Arabian traders would have hawked their human goods in centuries gone by. You can also see the striking sinkhole lake of Chilengwa, perpetually baffling locals with its curious absence of a water source. "
Blue Lagoon National Park,"Just 100 kilometers outside of Lusaka is where visitors will find the otherworldly delights of the Blue Lagoon National Park. Nestled atop the Kafue Flats, this vast floodplain of a reserve oscillates between cracked and sunbaked desert in the dry season and verdant watering hole when the rains come. It&#8217;s when the pearly waters begin to swell that most visitors will arrive. They go eager to spot rare birds in the canopies of acacias that line the little oxbow lakes and lagoons. Or, they go to wonder at the prancing lechwe antelopes as they dance around the forests. "
Chingola,"One of the so-called Copperbelt towns of the Zambian heartlands, little Chingola is a pretty place. It&#8217;s topped with the swaying boughs of acacia trees and the occasional spiny cactus, and ticks over to the down-to-earth thrum of copper mining machinery and the chatter of local prospectors. Today, a clutch of good hotels and restaurants draws a humble crowd of visitors each year. They come to wonder at the colossal open shaft mines that surround the settlement, or to have a round of golf in the nearby course – one of the most acclaimed in the entire of the Copperbelt region, nay, the whole country! "
Sioma Ngwezi National park,"Although ravaged by out-of-control poaching in past decades, the reserves of Sioma Ngwezi are now back on the up. Once again pulling in the occasional crowd of visitors, they have been graced with the re-established presence of African elephants in recent years (there are now an estimated 3,000 individuals here, largely found on the park&#8217;s southern edge). There are also all the usual kudus and impala, along with the possibility of rare cheetah sightings to boot. And what&#8217;s more, there are some luxury safari lodges to enjoy here, all within close distance to the pouring waters of the Ngonye Falls. "
Solwezi,"A down-to-earth mining center that sits perched high on the ridges of the north-western uplands of Zambia, Solwezi has graduated from sleepy backwater to booming industrial center. The newfound confidence has manifested in a clutch of lively beer bars and pubs that erupt with locals after dark, not to mention the appearance of just a couple of homestays for the burgeoning tourist scene. However, it&#8217;s not the copper mining but the rock works that will attract most of the crowds – Solwezi is home to some of the country&#8217;s oldest Stone Age engravings, which can be found in the caves and canyons along the Kifubwa River nearby. "
Victoria Falls,"There&#8217;s a clear reason why tersely-named Victoria Falls is one of Zimbabwe&#8217;s must-see places. Like the eponymous towns of Niagara in the US and Canada, the settlement is just a stone&#8217;s throw from the roaring waterfalls that gave it its moniker. Thousands of people flock here to see the awesome sight every year too. They join the baboons in the jungles and delve into the Victoria Falls National Park just to the south of the center, gawping and gasping as the great curtain of water comes into view, cascading dramatically off its black-rock cliffs in plumes of steam and mist. "
Harare,"Nearly three million people call the metropolis of Harare their home, making it not only the capital but also the largest city of the nation. Sat up on plateaus of Zimbabwe&#8217;s central highlands, it certainly looks the part. Endless steel-clad skyscrapers shoot up from its CBD &#8211; the economic kingpin of the country – and First Street and the downtown buzz with purring traffic and shoppers from morning until night. And there&#8217;s history too, poking out with the great preservation of the National Gallery, in the national archives, and the Queen Victoria Museum, not to mention the wealth of old colonial builds. Apart from that, visitors here can wallow in the pretty parks and wander between the jacarandas that famously pepper the roadways. "
Bulawayo,"Bulawayo belies a sort of New Orleans vibe. It&#8217;s got age-stained colonial frontispieces that ooze art deco and Victorian regal styles. It&#8217;s got swaying trees dotting its old avenues, and the occasional Anglo-esque public house occupying the arcades. But this second city is more than just a historical relic. It&#8217;s also an industrial and economic hub, once known for its smoke-belching factories, and still crisscrossed by more railway lines than you can shake a Ndebele tribal trinket at. The town is indelibly green and flowery, with bougainvillea cascading over the rooftops and palms peppering the roundabouts. Between it all you can see elegant governmental buildings, go shopping for trinkets, or plan your next safari out to the south-western parks. "
Matobo National Park,"The legendary Matobo National Park is a cross-shaped reserve found just south out of aforementioned Bulawayo. Famed since time immemorial for its curious array of inselbergs and hoodoo rock formations, it&#8217;s a land of sculpted granite peaks and anthropomorphic bluffs. These have been a shelter for man for millennia, and today it&#8217;s possible to spy out remnants of southern Africa&#8217;s pre-history carved into the stone at spots like the Nswatugi Cave. Meanwhile, others come to stalk ungulates in the Hove Wild Area – the dedicated game park here; a land of sable antelope and wildebeest, baboon packs and leopards. "
Nyanga National Park,"The home of the Highveld is a wild and wonderful place. Perched on the very roof of Zimbabwe, more than 1,800 meters above sea level, it&#8217;s formed by hulking hills of dolomite rock, and suspended boulders that creak in the cool breezes. Dressed in groves of msasa trees and cypresses that are rare to these regions, the habitats here can host a truly otherworldly array of creatures. Many are endemic, like the Old World Samango monkeys, with their white-brushed throats that can only be found in these parts. You&#8217;ll also find a smattering of leopards and lions, just in case you wanted a taste of the quintessential African safari! "
Hwange National Park,"Bringing up the forefront of Zimbabwe&#8217;s ecotourism offering with its nigh on 15,000 square kilometers of protected landscape, the Hwange National Park rarely fails to impress safari goers making their way through this section of southern Africa. Inside its boundaries is a mosaic of Kalahari woods and teak groves, grass plains and flood flats, all of which are peppered with bulbous termite mounds and the occasional pan – a watering hole that makes this one a perfect destination for lion stalkers. And apart from the kings of the plains, it&#8217;s also possible to see hyenas and wild dogs, leopard and cheetah, all lurking amidst the fossil-spotted river banks and bubbling hot springs. "
Mutare,"The gateway to the farthest eastern fringes of Zimbabwe and the Nyanga National Park besides, Mutare makes its home between the steep-side valleys of Manicaland. All around you can see the serrated tops of the Bvumba Mountains that enfold the town, making this one something of an enclave of civilization in the deep southern African wilds. Today, the place has developed a nice clutch of backpacker guesthouses and cheap hostels, giving it the rep of a fine stopover on route to hike the hills or stalk the curious Samango monkey atop the rugged Eastern Highlands. "
Masvingo,"Welcoming travelers to the deeper reaches of Zimbabwe, Masvingo is one of the prime drop off points for VIP buses heading through to the southern edge of the country. And what a welcome it is! Sat neatly on the edge of the Mutirikwi National Park, the place has plenty in the way of outdoors exploration up its sleeve. However, the real treat has to be the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Great Zimbabwe, which lurks between the bush some 20 kilometers away. These 700-year-old ruins crumble and crack under the sun, revealing tales of the nation&#8217;s old Shona-speaking folk. The so-called Hill Complex and Great Enclosure there are hailed as perhaps the most awesome example of drystone architecture on the globe! "
Lake Mutirikwi National Park,"In the shadow of the sculpted Beza Range and the undulating hills of southern Zimbabwe, the Lake Mutirikwi National Park is one of the country&#8217;s more off-the-beaten-track areas for outdoors recreation. Small and compact, it completely ensconces the reservoir of erstwhile Lake Kyle, which flooded the valleys here after the construction of a dam in 1960. As you flit between the empty banks and the smooth granite hills of the surrounding area, you&#8217;ll keep the company of ostriches and buffalo, not to mention local fishing folk searching for bass and bream beneath the waters. "
Chinhoyi,"A small crossroads town on the main way west from Harare to Lusaka across the border in Zambia, sleepy Chinhoyi is a kind of picture of rural Zimbabwe. It sits nestled between the rising ridges of the Mashonaland West Province, and comes with a sleepy vibe and a set of essential services – a bank, hospital and the like. However, Chinhoyi is famed mainly for one thing and one thing only: its caves. Known simply as the Chinhoyi caves, these carve their way into the cliffs just west of the center. They occupy their very own national park, and divers come from far and wide to try ultra-technical deep descents into the cool subterranean waters that hide in the gaping caverns. "
Mana Pools National Park,"The Mana Pools National Park is fed by the lifeblood of the Zambezi River, which spills over onto the plains and grasses here when the rains fall to create a patchwork of watering holes and pans during the wet season. Of these, it&#8217;s the largest four that gave the area its name (mana means &#8216;four&#8217; in the local vernacular), but there are actually countless little puddles to see. The main upshot is that animals gather at the sites to drink, making Mana Pools a game viewing destination of the top order. Despite being underdeveloped, there are more crocodiles and hippos here than you can rattle a baobab tree at, and visitors during the monsoon are virtually guaranteed a sighting! "
Matusadona National Park,"Clinging to the southern banks of Lake Kariba, on the Zimbabwean side of the great water body, Matusadona National Park is a relic of the former state of Rhodesia. After becoming subsumed by Zimbabwe following the upheavals, the area retained its protected status. And it&#8217;s easy to see why! First off, the whole region is beautifully untouched and untrodden, with Cape buffalo and elephants by far the most common mammalian inhabitants. Secondly, there&#8217;s the waters of Kariba itself, which have created ample grazing lands since the creation of the Kariba Dam, allowing ungulates and predators alike to thrive along its fringes. "
Gonarezhou National Park,"You could be forgiven for thinking that you were strolling through Colorado or Arizona as you move between the rock-ribbed, rust-colored escarpments that dominate the vistas in the North Gonarezhou National Park. This wild land covers a whopping 5,000 square kilometers, which is just a portion of the colossal Limpopo conservancy, set to sprawl out across the frontier into Mozambique when its fully established. Elephants and giraffe are common sightings, while you&#8217;ll also be able to spot wild dog packs and zebra between the mopane woods. "
Kadoma,"Deep in the very heartlands of Zimbabwe, the town of Kadoma actually started life as a ramshackle gold rush town, housing the miners and prospectors who flocked to the central provinces here to chip away at the ground. After gold was found, the spot developed quickly, slowly giving rise to hotels and banks and businesses. Today, Kadoma is a richly-imbued place, with some colonial-style church towers and a lively local population of nearly 80,000. Come here to learn about Zimbabwe&#8217;s mineral wealth, and see cotton fields swaying in the African breezes. "
Kariba Lake,"The kingpin of the Kariba Lake region and the Zambezi Valley, this little lakeside town draws thousands of visitors a year to the extreme northern reaches of the country. Set just on the edge of Zambia, it offers access to the breathtaking Kariba Dam – one of the most awesome engineering feats in these parts. It&#8217;s also the place to come for hiking and outdoor explorations around the edges of the water, or to watch the red-pink African sunsets in the company of locals, as the evening hues descend over Antelope Island in the distance. "
